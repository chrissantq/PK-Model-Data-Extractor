Python script to extract pharmacokinetics papers from PubMed searches
and store table and freetext data about the model used in the study.

The following variables are required to be set in the .env file:
  ENTREZ_API_KEY=""
  ENTREZ_EMAIL=""
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
  AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
  AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=""
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=""

This program makes use of the Entrez API to search PubMed, fetch abstracts, and link
abstracts to the corresponding PMC article if it exists. It also utilizes Azure OpenAI
to screen the tables and freetext of any returned articles for relevant model data.
