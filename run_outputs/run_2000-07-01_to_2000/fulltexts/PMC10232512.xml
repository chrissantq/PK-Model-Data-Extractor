This technology expands the understanding of pathological and physiological changes. A skin chip, as in vitro model, consisting of normal skin tissue with epidermis and dermis layer (full thickness) was developed. Polydimethylsiloxane microchannels with a fed-batched controlled perfusion feeding system were used to create a full-thick ex-vivo human skin on-chip model. The design of a novel skin-on-a-chip model was reported, in which the microchannel structures mimic the architecture of the realistic vascular network as nutrients transporter to the skin layers. Viabilities of full-thick skin samples cultured on the microbioreactor and traditional tissue culture plate revealed that a precise controlled condition provided by the microfluidic enhanced tissue viability at least for seven days. Several advantages in skin sample features under micro-scale-controlled conditions were found such as skin mechanical strength, water adsorption, skin morphology, gene expression, and biopsy longevity. This model can provide an in vitro environment for localizing drug delivery and transdermal drug diffusion studies. The skin on the chip can be a valuable in vitro model for representing the interaction between drugs and skin tissue and a realistic platform for evaluating skin reaction to pharmaceutical materials and cosmetic products.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Due to several benefits, human skin models draw more and more attention in research works. The skin is the largest human organ which is not only the first defense line of the body, but it also has the duty of featuring human appearance beauties. Being the outermost layer of the body, the skin is exposed to mechanical, (bio) chemical, or biological environmental effects which cause dermal disease or damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. On the other hand, several internal diseases change the skin appearance. In recent decades, transdermal drug delivery has added to the duties of the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Depending on the research work, the approach to preparing human skin equivalents varies. Skin is the largest organ that coats the surface of the body. It has many functions, including regulating heat, conducting physical sensations, and acting as a mechanical barrier (to protect the body against the invasion of microorganisms and harmful environmental factors such as radiation, mechanical damage, and heat and chemical burns). Skin tissue is made of three major layers, namely the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">With the approval of the Animal Prohibition legislation for cosmetic and chemical ingredient testing, there is a need for alternative 3D models to replace animal testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The lack of similarity between human and animal skin and the ethical reasons for using animal models have fueled studies on designing new skin models that are more similar to real skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The development and evolution of skin tissue in vitro have led to the development of 3D skin models. The physiological response of cells in these models in terms of biochemical signals and structural and mechanical properties should be like actual skins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Advanced models are also needed to precisely demonstrate drug-cell interactions.</p><p id="Par7">Scientists use standard cellular tissue technologies and animal models in the preclinical stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Clinical trials are one of the last stages of drug production and the high failure rate at this stage is because the results obtained in cell-based experiments on animal models and in-vitro, which fail to represent the cell's response to the drug in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">However, these models are not yet effective in mimicking all aspects of human skin function and complexity, mainly due to a lack of cell variety, innervation, and vascularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Microfluidics can create better platforms for examining skin equivalents under a controllable environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Given that the combination of different cell types with a wide variety of structural proteins is needed to build skin, using Ex-vivo human skin biopsies looks very appealing and is expected to return the closest model to the real skin. In this regard, for several decades, the Franz apparatus was the most prevalent experimental setup using human living skin biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">There are two major obstacles to designing experiments using the Franz apparatus. The first is finding enough skin, and the second is using a significant amount of medium in the apparatus dilutes all the secreted metabolites from the skin or transferred material in transdermal drug delivery studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Up until now, different microfluidic systems have been designed and performed. Many of these models have enhanced our understanding of sciences such as physiology, pharmacology, and toxicology. The organ-on-a-chip concept is a combination of cell culture techniques and protocols and fluid systems in microliter volumes to analyze the normal functions of human organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Through miniaturizing the experimental setup, the needed skin surface is reduced by several folds. In addition, through the micro channels and micro fabrication, nutrients can be transferred to the skin cells more efficiently which decreases the amount of medium. In case of having a high volume of skin and medium, applying a microfluidic device seems optional but limited resource of living human skin, in one hand, and needs to trace of very little number of active molecules in the medium on the other hand elaborate skin-on-a-chip as a vital choice in compare with traditional methods. A microfluidic device is the main solution to overcome the obstacles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">In the following study, the physicochemical and biological differences were compared between a human skin biopsy in macrosystems (traditional culture method) and when the skin is mounted onto a micro vascularized microbioreactor (&#181;BR). In the end, an Ex-vivo human skin model on a chip was introduced that can be highly recommended for drug screening tests and transdermal drug delivery studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par15">There are several commercial reconstructed skin models with limitations. For instance, they cannot mimic the nature of skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Scaffolds, in bioartificial 3D constructs aimed to resemble skin, function as ECM. They degrade rapidly and have a shortened lifetime, which notably decreases their applicability over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Most Human Skin Equivalents models have a simplified bi-layer-setup, including epidermal and dermal layers with simplified cellular such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts respectively. These setups cannot mimic micro architecture that features cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;matrix interaction, diverse cellular composition, and dermal-epidermal signaling events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">In addition, due to the natural differences between animal and human skin physiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the results from animal model experiments, especially in the field of transdermal drug delivery, could not predict human skin responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, many of the potential drugs, which show promising results in animal model studies, fail in clinical trial steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">One drawback is the lack of blood vessels in these models that results in limitations in dynamic transport of nutrients and real-time measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Living human skin on a chip model represented here is a reliable candidate to overcome the limitations because it creates a skin microenvironment as close as possible to human in vivo conditions. These models provide a reaction between skin and ECM in microfluidic platforms. Due to the dynamic flow rate in microfluidic platforms, it is capable of mimicking microvasculature and therefore it is capable of analysis of dynamic transdermal drug delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">A novel skin-on-chip device was introduced with an innovative microfluidic design that enabled the maintenance of normal skin tissue for a long time without using any support materials. Nutrient mediums pass through the microfluidic channels. Two plexiglasses seal PDMS layers prevent any media leakage. The flow of media via microchannels provides a continuous supply of nutrients and removal of waste products through outlets resembling the role of blood vessels in actual human skin tissue. The structural integrity of skin samples cultured in the microsystem was tested in comparison with a macro condition and permeability of skin samples.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and operating conditions of skin chips</title><p id="Par22">The main frame of the skin chip model was prepared using PDMS. The chip consists of two layers that are covered by two polystyrene sheet layers. The bottom PDMS layer consists of microfluidic channels, a two-reservoir chamber, and a chamber for cultured skin tissue. The medium was supplied via a serum tube, connected to the bottom channels and waste removal was performed through an outlet.

However, these models cannot mimic the dynamic of the full thickness of human skin conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to mimic native human skin tissue structure and functions to create the skin on chip model resembling normal-like-skin physiological conditions. To study cell&#8211;cell interactions, their responses to mechanical force, and various physical and chemical factors, the skin on a chip and the same skin samples in a traditional culture plate were studied. The results, in almost all the experiments, showed a significant decay in the tissue cultivated in the macro system in comparison with the semi-batch perfusion microfluidic system. Hence, the development of skin-on-chip models has prominent advantages compared to available options, such as portability, faster preparation, cost-effectiveness, and enhancing the efficiency of drug research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Various studies have demonstrated that SEs maintenance needs supplementary materials; however, we showed skin tissue samples can be kept alive without any expensive growth factors, in presence of a perfusion flow regimen.</p><p id="Par25">The perfusion flow regimen was a renewing fed-batch that injected 500&#160;&#181;L of the medium every 8&#160;h. The discharged materials were collected for further studies such as mass transfer measurements or glucose consumption which is not included in this article<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">The focus of the study was on designing a skin model with microvascular channels by exchanging sufficient nutrients and oxygen that leads to long-term physiologically conserved tissue survival which is detailed in cell viability section of the results and discussion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Physical and mechanical properties of the skin model</title><p id="Par27">The skin sample was cultured with a specific size (0.8&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>) on &#181;BR and the device was designed in such a way that the rate of stretching and shrinkage was kept constant during the test. This was not possible in TCPs condition, so the skin samples were floated on the medium.</p><p id="Par28">As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E, the tensile result for the skin sample in the &#181;BR decreases by about 30% after one week while, the mechanical strength for TCPs is down to 70% after 1&#160;week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The mean of three repeats of identical donor samples is reported in the graph, it is noteworthy that the standard deviation was less than 6% between the three runs.</p><p id="Par29">The swelling ratio diagram showed that the skin samples in the TCPs group had a higher adsorption rate due to the high amount of medium than the &#181;BR sample group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). The results are consistent with the read-out from the tensile strength test. In all traditional setups, such as the Franz apparatus, included skin samples are in contact with or submerged in a culture medium. As is shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F, when a normal skin sample comes in contact with several times larger volume of an aqueous solution, the skin absorbs water even if the medium is an isotonic solution. ECM has great potential to retain liquids. Based on these results, water retention is highly proportional to the amount of available liquid medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The swelling graph shows 7% water adsorption in &#181;BR group after 16&#160;h, whereas TCPs samples adsorb about 20% at the same time which is about threefold higher which can lead to dramatic changes in all aspects of the skin properties. The swelling graph shows 7% water adsorption in &#181;BR group after 16&#160;h, whereas TCPs samples adsorb about 20% at the same time which is about threefold higher which can lead to dramatic changes in all aspects of the skin properties. The mean of three repeats from identical donor sample is reported in the graph, it is noteworthy that the standard deviation was less than 8% between the three runs.</p><p id="Par30">One of the main characteristics of the skin is moisture level control. Moisture in the skin plays an important role in maintenance, metabolism, enzymatic activity, mechanical properties, and appearance and eventually plays a functional and protective barrier. Air humidity and underlying skin moisture are the only sources of skin moisture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The corneum layer protects other layers of the epidermis, in addition preventing water loss and entry of external factors. Thus, this layer shows the greatest resistance in mass transfer. Given that in macro setups the skin samples are drenched with an aqueous solution, and the interstitial space of the cells are filled with hydrophilic medium, the setups facilitate mass transfer which is far from the real characteristics of the skin.</p><p id="Par31">An interesting observation was a significant drop after 32&#160;h in the capability of water retention which can be related to the steep slope of degradation of skin matrix, which needs further studies. No matter what the reason is, applying the skin biopsy in a system with plenty of available liquid medium leads to adsorbing up to 20% liquid which causes swelling. Swollen skin mass transfer coefficient is definitely not the same as normal skin.</p><p id="Par32">Based on this observation it seems that using microfluidic systems is not just an option to reduce costs. In other words, being drenched in liquid medium in TCPs facilitates swelling which deforms and even deteriorates the skin structure which is in consistent with histological results and electron micrographs of the sample (the results will be represented later in this article). Several histological studies have been carried out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> in-vitro skin model samples which could be misleading due the sample deformation because of swelling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cell viability within the skin chip</title><p id="Par33">One of the key points for the successful operation of the skin chip model is the efficient transport of nutrients from microchannels to the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin.
