Since previous results have revealed that injecting valproate before allowing animals to consume a novel flavor solution resulted in an attenuation of neophobia, we predicted a similar effect when the novel flavor is presented on a drug-free trial in the presence of a context previously associated with the drug. In line with this hypothesis, in our first experiment we observed a reduction in neophobia to a novel flavor for those animals tested in the presence of the context associated with Sodium Valproate. However, a control group that received the drug before being allowed access to the novel flavor showed a significant reduction in consumption. Experiment 2 revealed that the unconditioned effects of the drug include a deleterious effect on the animals&#8217; locomotor activity that probably interferes with drinking behavior. Finally, in a third experiment, we directly tested the potential anxiolytic properties of sodium valproate by injecting the drug before implementing a fear conditioning procedure. These findings are explained in terms of the unconditioned anxiolytic action of the drug and the formation of an association between the context and the effects of the drug that evokes a conditioned response reminiscent of such anxiolytic effect.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigaci&#243;n</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-107530GB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5199-5851</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>De la Casa</surname><given-names>Luis Gonzalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Agencia Estatal de Investigaci&#243;n (AEI) of Spain (grant no.: PID2019-107530GB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

Subsequently, ample experimental evidence has demonstrated conditioning using the effects of many different drugs as the Unconditioned Stimulus (US) [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These studies have focused not only on analyzing the learned associations that emerge after pairing the Conditioned Stimulus (CS) and the US [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while also identifying the structures and neural circuits that constitute the neurobiological bases of learning [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the causes of drug addictions since conditioning has been proposed as a potential trigger of relapse and tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In three experiments, we explored the result of pairing a neutral stimulus (a distinctive context) with the effects of Sodium Valproate (or Valproic Acid, VPA), one of the most widely used and effective anticonvulsants for the treatment of epilepsy [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The main action of VPA on the nervous system is related to the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and its antiepileptic properties are largely based on the increased levels of this neurotransmitter after its administration [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is this agonist effect on the GABAergic system that underpins its potential anxiolytic properties, which have already been observed in several experiments with rodents, showing a reduction in behaviors associated with anxiety after VPA administration [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, for example, Corbett et al. [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] employed various tests to measure anxiety in rodents treated with VPA (Geller test, cross maze, or social interaction tests) and observed that, after systematic administration, the animals showed a reduction in anxiety-related behaviors. In a similar vein, Kinrys et al. [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studied the effects of VPA in people with a social anxiety disorder. After a 12-week treatment with the drug, they observed a significant reduction in symptoms, suggesting its potential use for treating this type of disorder.</p><p>In a study aimed at exploring the potential anxiolytic properties of VPA, Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] analyzed the effects of administering various doses of the drug (100 and 300 mg/kg) on flavor neophobia (using a compound of citric acid and sodium saccharin dissolved in water). Flavor neophobia is a defensive mechanism that produces a reduction in consumption of a new flavor [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and seems to be related, at least to some degree, to anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In terms of survival, this mechanism protects the organism against potentially dangerous foods since consumption is reduced, thereby limiting any possible poisonous consequences. Alternatively, if an aversive effect does not follow consumption, the initial rejection of the flavor disappears, and it becomes a safe or familiar stimulus due to habituation of neophobia, which results in a progressive increase in flavor consumption [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The results of the neophobia test in the experiment conducted by Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that administering VPA before allowing the animals to consume the novel flavor resulted in increased consumption (i.e., attenuation of neophobia) compared to a control group that received a vehicle. Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] interpreted these results in terms of the potential anxiolytic action of VPA that would have reduced the anxiety induced by encountering the novel flavor.</p><p>In this paper, we analyzed the potential anxiolytic properties of VPA (300 mg/Kg) and the possibility that such properties could be associated with a neutral context so that, later on, such a context elicits a conditioned response that mimics the anxiolytic properties of the drug. More specifically, we wanted to confirm whether the context-CS elicited an anxiolytic conditioned response that reduced the intensity of neophobia reported by Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To this end, in the first experiment we presented a novel flavor in the presence of a context that had been repeatedly associated with VPA. The second experiment was designed to replicate the unconditioned effect of VPA on neophobia and to detect potential alterations in locomotor activity as a side effect of the drug. Finally, a third experiment was designed to check the anxiolytic properties of valproate on fear conditioning, a procedure highly dependent on emotional factors [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>We anticipated that repeated pairings of a distinctive context with the effects of the drug would establish the context as a CS capable of evoking an anxiolytic conditioned response. Consequently, neophobia to a novel flavor would be reduced when the animal is tested in the presence of the CS-context. Additionally, we expected that the unconditioned anxiolytic properties of valproate would reduce neophobia and fear-conditioned intensity.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>The main objective of this experiment was to test whether the repeated pairing of a context (the CS) with the anxiolytic effects derived from the administration of VPA (the US) induces a conditioned response to the context that reduces the intensity of neophobia (and its habituation) in the same way as when the drug is directly administered prior to consumption of the novel flavor [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, such an effect would not be observed when VPA is administered after context exposure or in a saline-treated group. Finally, we also expect to replicate the attenuation of neophobia reported by Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] when the drug is injected before consumption of the novel flavor.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-two experimentally na&#239;ve male Wistar rats (group size n = 8), participated in this experiment. The mean weight at the start of the experiment was 356 g. At the arrival to the laboratory, the animals were housed in groups of 2/3 (depending of the animals&#8217; weight) in type IIIH cages (820 cm2), with wood savings as bedding, and other materials available in the cages (pieces of fabric, cardboard and wood, stones, etc.), except for the time they were submitted to the experimental procedure when they were individually housed. The vivarium was maintained on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 07:00 h), and all behavioral testing was conducted during the light period of the cycle. Four days before the start of the experimental sessions, each animal was handled daily for 5 min. The day before to initiate the experimental treatment all animals were placed on a water deprivation schedule (30 min/day access to water) that was maintained across the entire duration of the experiment. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research, University of Seville (Protocol CEEA-US2020-15/2), and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments, and the Spanish R.D. 223/1988.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Apparatus and drugs</title><p>All experimental sessions were conducted in eight Plexiglas cages, 21 x 18 x 35.5 cm, with paper strips as bedding, located in an experimental room, different to the vivarium, illuminated by a single 54-W fluorescent white light on the ceiling.

However, the reduced consumption of the novel flavored solution for the Sal-Sal/VPA Group at the neophobia stage was unexpected since, using the same parameters, Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] observed the opposite result, namely an increase in consumption of the novel solution when 300 mg/Kg of VPA was i.p. injected 30 m before access to the solution. Similarly, water consumption was reduced for the group that received VPA before the conditioning trials, but this reduction was only evident during the first 30 minutes of each trial.</p><p>A possible reason for the reduced consumption observed after VPA administration could be related to the motor disturbances induced by VPA that have been reported in previous studies. In fact, the dose injected in our experiments (300 mg/Kg) is above those that have demonstrated anticonvulsive effects in rats and can induce side effects such ataxia, hypolocomotion, reduction of grooming, muscle relaxation, or wet dog shake behavior [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We did not register such type of behavior, but can anticipate that these disturbances could have disrupted normal drinking behavior, resulting in reduced consumption.</p><p>This possibility was tested in the second experiment, which included three groups exposed to the same novel solution employed in the first experiment. One group received an i.p. injection of 300 mg/kg 30 min before flavor exposure (Group VPA-30), the second group received VPA just before allowing the animal to drink the novel flavor (Group VPA-0), while half of the animals in the third group received saline 30 min before flavor exposure, and the other half saline immediately before such exposure (Group Sal).</p><p>Neophobia tests were conducted for three consecutive days (30 min access to the flavor each day) in experimental chambers designed to detect the animals&#8217; movements.

Furthermore, the anxiolytic effect was demonstrated by a reduction in fear conditioning in Experiment 3, and as a conditioned response that reduced the intensity of neophobia in Experiment 1. Therefore, the increased consumption of a novel flavor for those rats tested in the presence of a context previously associated with the effect of VPA can only be interpreted in terms of an anxiolytic conditioned response induced by the context-CS; any explanation in terms of residual effects of the drug on the drug-free test day is ruled out by the fact that the animals that received VPA after context exposure showed no change in neophobia. Thus, we were able to confirm our main hypothesis that in this case a Pavlovian association is formed between a distinct context (the CS) and the effects of the drug (the US).</p><p>The reduction in fear conditioning for the group that received VPA before the tone-shock pairings in Experiment 3 was probably due to the unconditioned anxiolytic effect of VPA, a property that has been demonstrated in previous research using different anxiety behavioral task [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this case, a possible explanation in terms of lack of memory consolidation of the tone-shock association can be ruled out for the absence of an effect on fear conditioning for the group that received VPA immediately after the conditioning trials. However, we cannot completely rule out an account in terms of the possible effect of the drug on the perceived intensity of the shock, which could have weakened the strength of the association with the tone. However, this possibility is unlikely considering that the level of freezing shown by the VPA-Before group at the end of conditioning treatment was at asymptote and similar to the remaining groups.</p><p>The deleterious effect of VPA on locomotor activity was clearly established when the percentage of activity was recorded after drug administration in Experiment 2. The greater detrimental effect of the drug on locomotor activity for those animals that received the drug immediately before the test compared with those that received VPA 30 m before the test, revealed that such an effect was time-dependent and relatively short-lasting. The reduction in locomotor activity is most likely the result of the lower water consumption observed when the animals received VPA before the conditioning stage of Experiment 1 and the reduction in consumption of the novel flavor for the animals injected with the drug in Experiment 2. This result was largely unexpected since Shepard [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported an increase in the consumption of a novel flavor after administering both 100 and 300 mg/Kg. of VPA. There are only two apparent procedural differences between Shepard&#8217;s experiments and those reported here: the context used as the experimental environment and the period for measuring fluid consumption. Regarding the experimental context, Shepard conducted the entire procedure in the animal&#8217;s home cage. However, the present experiments were run in distinctive cages located outside of the vivarium. This could be a possible factor responsible for the discrepancy in results since it has been demonstrated that consumption of a novel flavor is greater when presented in a familiar and safe home cage than in a novel and potentially dangerous context [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A second relevant difference is related to the periods for which intake was recorded since Shepard recorded fluid intake after 6, 18, and 30 m, but we only recorded consumption after 30 m. Importantly, Shepard found a significant increase in consumption after 6 m but not after 18 or 30 m. Therefore, the mentioned procedural discrepancies between experiments could, at least in part, explain the different results, although this possibility merits further investigation. In any case, such differences do not undermine the main conclusions drawn from our experiments, namely the anxiolytic effect of VPA and the emergence of an anxiolytic conditioned response through a classical conditioning process.</p><p>Alternative explanations for the changes in neophobia mediated by the anxiolytic conditioned response observed in the VPA-Sal/Sal Group in the test phase of Experiment 1 include the effects of context novelty on fluid consumption [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. More specifically, considering that VPA administration could have altered context processing during the conditioning stage, it is possible that such a context could have been rendered relatively novel at the time of testing for the animals that received the drug. Furthermore, previous research has revealed that neophobia increases when the flavor is presented in a novel context, possibly due to exploratory responses interfering with consumption [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, in Experiment 1, we observed an increase in consumption for the group that received VPA before context conditioning instead of the reduction that would have been expected if the context had remained functionally novel, thus ruling out an interpretation of our results in terms of exploratory behavior interfering with fluid intake.</p><p>The role of context in neophobia has received rather limited attention, possibly because the key factors proposed as determinants of neophobia are mainly related to the characteristics of the novel flavor [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or to the deprivation state of the animals at the time of consumption [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the experimental context has shown to play a key role in both neophobia and its habituation [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, in a novel context, the presentation of an unknown flavor produces an increase in neophobia. Consequently, consumption is reduced compared to when the same flavor is presented for the first time in a familiar context [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, consumption increases when a flavor is presented in contexts previously associated with appetitive stimuli but decreases when the flavor appears in a context associated with aversive stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, other studies suggest that when a novel taste is presented in a changing environment, the neophobic response is weaker [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present paper, we have proposed a new role for the context in modulating the consumption of novel flavors since neophobia and its habituation can be reduced when the novel flavor is consumed in the presence of a context previously associated with the anxiolytic effects of a drug.</p><p>Regarding the unconditioned anxiolytic effect of VPA, previous studies have proposed that this depends on an elevation of GABA levels [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in addition to blocking of GABA re-uptake [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, some data indicate that the action of VPA resembles that of benzodiazepines, with which it also shares anticonvulsant properties and acts as a muscle relaxant [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Such anxiolytic effects of VPA have been demonstrated with a wide variety of procedures, such as the consumption of new flavors with high palatability [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], different types of conflict tasks both with shock [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and without shock [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the light-dark aversion test [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the staircase test [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the elevated plus-maze [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], or social interaction [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As mentioned above, we have directly confirmed the anxiolytic effect of VPA using both a fear conditioning procedure (Experiment 3), and the effects of a conditioning process on neophobia (Experiment 1).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that VPA may be useful for the treatment of a wide range of pathologies, such as bipolar disorder [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], migraines [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], disorders related to motor disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and even in cancer treatment [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Among these novel and promising applications of VPA, stands out its possible use as an anxiolytic agent [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], due to the above mentioned agonistic action on the GABAergic system, similar to the mechanisms of action of benzodiazepines [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Thus, it seems that this drug could be useful in a wide range of disorders in which anxiety plays a leading role. For example, there are studies suggesting its effectiveness for the treatment of social anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], post-traumatic stress disorders [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and generalized anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], among others. The findings of our study support previous research on potential application of this drug as an anxiolytic agent and include evidence of the contextual influence that accompanies drug use, already demonstrated in other substances [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279511.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and increasingly present in the clinical treatment of anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0279511.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>In sum, we have demonstrated that VPA (300 mg/Kg) induces a reduction in locomotor activity and has anxiolytic properties. Interestingly, this anxiolytic effect can be associated with a neutral stimulus (a distinctive context) and expressed as a conditioned response that reduces the intensity of neophobia and its habituation to a new flavor. These findings have implications for the potential therapeutic use of VPA, our understanding of the mechanisms of classical conditioning using drug stimuli, and the links between contextual cues and neophobia.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0279511.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"

Further, motoric effects of VPA are addressed. The manuscript is well-written. The experiments were rigorously designed and analyzed (except where noted below).</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Exp 3: Given the motoric effects of VPA demonstrated in Exp 2, it is especially important to show the freezing levels in the acquisition and extinction phases prior to onset of the first tone. Related to this, was the extinction test conducted in a separate context from the acquisition? If not, how is context freezing distinguished from tone freezing?</p><p>2) Exp 3: It would be more appropriate to conduct separate 3 X 3 (Trial X Group) ANOVAs for the acquisition and extinction phases of the experiment, as opposed to the 6 X 3 ANOVA that the authors reported. The two phases are distinct and should be treated as such statistically.</p><p>3) Discussion: There are a number of issues concerning the interpretation of Exp 3 results. First, I&#8217;m not convinced that the results of Exp 3 say anything about anxiety. It is possible (probable) that VPA administered prior to fear conditioning would have a direct effect on the acquisition of fear, irrespective of any potential effect on anxiety. Second, it is necessary to rule out the (strong) possibility of state-dependent learning effects in Exp 3, especially since VPA has clearly demonstrated unconditioned motoric effects.</p><p>4) Generally, I believe this set of experiments, while conducted well, are inconclusive with regards to the overall interpretation of VPA effects on anxiety. Assessment of VPA effects on anxiety using a classic anxiety behavioral task (or multiple tasks) would significantly strengthen the interpretation the authors favor.</p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>1) Lines 148-149: List groups in same order (in text) as listed in Table 1.</p><p>2) Clarify whether Figure 1B represents total consumption (minutes 1-60) or consumption for minutes 30-60.</p><p>3) Line 411: change &#8220;free-drug&#8221; to &#8220;drug-free&#8221;</p><p>4) It would be useful to include a direct assessment of footshock reactivity during acquisition in Exp 3 (e.g., activity burst; Fanselow, 1982).</p><p>Fanselow, Michael S. &#8220;The Postshock Activity Burst.&#8221; Animal Learning &amp; Behavior, vol. 10, no. 4, Nov. 1982, pp. 448&#8211;54.

</p><p>Responses to each point raised by the editor and the reviewer:</p><p>EDITOR:</p><p>- do not start the sentence with number. i.e. 24 rats.... Also, indicate that group size is denoted as n=8</p><p>Done</p><p>&#8232;- avoid repeating common info for each experiment, i.e. Ethical statements. Be clear in declarations and animal welfare committee approval numbers, but once.</p><p>Done</p><p>&#8232;- VPA dose of 300 mg/kg is above those achieving anticonvulsive effects in the rats (e.g. PMID: 17714087). Some side effects could occur. Please, discuss. Did you noticed any in general behavior of rats.</p><p>The potential side effects of the VPA dose injected in our experiments were mentioned in the introduction of Experiment 2. As for such possible side effects affecting to our sample of animals, we only registered percent time of activity, so we cannot report other specific motoric side effects. Anyway, we have mentioned in the ms that 300 mg/Kg is above the usual anticonvulsive dose and that we did not registered specific movements. The paragraph now reads (p. 12, lines 276-281): &#8220;In fact, the dose injected in our experiments (300 mg/Kg) is above those that have demonstrated anticonvulsive effects in rats and can induce side effects such ataxia, hypolocomotion, reduction of grooming, muscle relaxation, or wet dog shake behavior [32,33,34,35]. We did not register such type of behavior, but can anticipate that these disturbances could have disrupted normal drinking behavior, resulting in reduced consumption.&#8221;</p><p>&#8232;- More profoundly discuss the clinical relevance of the findings.</p><p>We have included two paragraph in the discussion section describing the potential clinical relevance of our results (p. 24-25, lines 598-614): &#8221;Recent studies suggest that VPA may be useful for the treatment of a wide range of pathologies, such as bipolar disorder [51,52,53], migraines [54,55,56], disorders related to motor disturbances [57,58], and even in cancer treatment [59,60,61]. Among these novel and promising applications of VPA, stands out its possible use as an anxiolytic agent [23, 62, 63, 64], due to the above mentioned agonistic action on the GABAergic system, similar to the mechanisms of action of benzodiazepines [21, 24, 64, 65].</p><p>Thus, it seems that this drug could be useful in a wide range of disorders in which anxiety plays a leading role. For example, there are studies suggesting its effectiveness for the treatment of social anxiety disorders [24], post-traumatic stress disorders [66,67], and generalized anxiety disorders (68,69), among others. The findings of our study support previous research on potential application of this drug as an anxiolytic agent and include evidence of the contextual influence that accompanies drug use, already demonstrated in other substances [8,9,70,71], and increasingly present in the clinical treatment of anxiety [72, 73,74]&#8221;</p><p>REVIEWER #1:&#160;</p><p> &#8232;Major concerns:</p><p>&#8232;1) Exp 3: Given the motoric effects of VPA demonstrated in Exp 2, it is especially important to show the freezing levels in the acquisition and extinction phases prior to onset of the first tone. </p><p>We have introduced in the results section of Exp. 3 statistical analyses on freezing prior to the first tone for conditioning and extinction stages. The results revealed a significant increase of freezing for the VPA/Before Group as compare to Sal/Before and VPA/After groups, confirming the reduction of movements induced by VPA. A similar analysis on percent of freezing for the period previous to the first tone presentation in the extinction phase showed a reduce level of freezing for those animals in the VPA/before Group, probably revealing a low level of fear to the context as compared to the control groups. Specifically, the following paragraphs have been introduced in the ms (p. 18-19, lines 446-461): &#8220;We conducted preliminary one-way ANOVAs on mean percent freezing during the 180 s period prior to the onset of the first CS-tone for conditioning and testing stages with Groups as main factor. The analyses for the conditioning stage revealed a significant effect of Groups, F(2, 20)=47.63; p&lt;.001, &#951;2=.82. Post-hoc comparisons between groups (Bonferroni, p&lt;.05) revealed a higher level of freezing for the VPA/Before (Mean = 87.42%, SD = 27.03) as compared to the VPA/After and Sal/Before groups (Mean = 13.88%, SD = 3.84, and Mean = 19.37%, SD = 6.34). This result confirms the reduction in locomotor activity induced by VPA. </p><p>The analyses for the first pre-CS period for the extinction stage also revealed differences between Groups, F(2, 20)=17.03; p&lt;.001, &#951;2=.63. Post-hoc comparisons between groups (Bonferroni, p&lt;.05) revealed a lower level of freezing for the VPA/Before (Mean = 30.91%, SD = 23.84) as compared to the VPA/After and Sal/Before groups (Mean = 87.71%, SD = 12.88, and Mean = 81.61%, SD = 20.92). These differences probably indicate that fear conditioning generalized to the context, but to a lesser extent in the group that received VPA before conditioning stage.&#8221;</p><p>2) Related to this, was the extinction test conducted in a separate context from the acquisition? If not, how is context freezing distinguished from tone freezing?</p><p>The acquisition and extinction tests were conducted in the same context. As pointed out by the reviewer, this prevents distinguishing between the freezing produced by the context and that produced by the tone at testing. In fact, as shown in the new analyses included in the results section of Experiment 3, context freezing for the VPA/after and Sal/after groups was significantly higher than that for the VPA/Before group. However, this does not compromise, but rather adds validity to the interpretation proposed in the manuscript, according to which the administration of VPA for the VPA/Before group resulted in a reduction of fear conditioning intensity (both to the Tone-CS and to the context).</p><p>&#8232;2) Exp 3: It would be more appropriate to conduct separate 3 X 3 (Trial X Group) ANOVAs for the acquisition and extinction phases of the experiment, as opposed to the 6 X 3 ANOVA that the authors reported. The two phases are distinct and should be treated as such statistically.</p><p>In Experiment 3 the data from conditioning and testing were analyzed separately. The ANOVA for conditioning stage was 3 x 3 since there were three conditioning trials, and the ANOVA for extinction was 6 x 3 because it comprised six trials.</p><p>&#8232;3) Discussion: There are a number of issues concerning the interpretation of Exp 3 results. First, I&#8217;m not convinced that the results of Exp 3 say anything about anxiety. It is possible (probable) that VPA administered prior to fear conditioning would have a direct effect on the acquisition of fear, irrespective of any potential effect on anxiety. Second, it is necessary to rule out the (strong) possibility of state-dependent learning effects in Exp 3, especially since VPA has clearly demonstrated unconditioned motoric effects.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are other possible interpretations for the reduced conditioning observe in the VAL/Before group in Experiment 3. In fact, we recognized such possibility in the first version of the ms when saying &#8220;we cannot completely rule out an account in terms of the possible effect of the drug on the perceived intensity of the shock, which could have weakened the strength of the association with the tone&#8221;. In addition, the hypothesis on the anxiolytic effect of Valproate is supported not only by the results of Experiment 3, but it has been repeatedly informed in previous research (e.g., Simiand et. al., 1984; De Angelis, 1992, 1995), that adds validity to our interpretation. </p><p>Anyway, the paragraph on page 21 (lines 513-516) has been modified to reflect the reviewer&#8217;s suggestion, and now reads: &#8220;The reduction in fear conditioning for the group that received VPA before the tone-shock pairings in Experiment 3 was probably due to the unconditioned anxiolytic effect of VPA, a property that has been demonstrated in previous research using different anxiety behavioral task (e.g., De Angelis, 19-22).&#8221; </p><p>Regarding a possible state dependent learning in Experiment 3, we think it is a really interesting topic that deserve additional research. However, in most experiments using drugs as the US and context as CS there is a minimum of 4 context &#8211; drug long pairings to support conditioning. Considering that in our Experiment 3 there were only one drug-context coincidence, it is unlikely that it supported a conditioned reduction of locomotor activity during the free-drug test. In the same vein, and taking into account that VPA produced a reduction in motor activity during the conditioning trial, we would have to interpret the increase in locomotor activity as an opponent CR that is not common when analyzing locomotor conditioning with other drugs that induce hypolocomotion.</p><p> &#8232;4) Generally, I believe this set of experiments, while conducted well, are inconclusive with regards to the overall interpretation of VPA effects on anxiety. Assessment of VPA effects on anxiety using a classic anxiety behavioral task (or multiple tasks) would significantly strengthen the interpretation the authors favor.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that adding additional experimental evidence would strengthen our hypothesis about the anxiolytic properties of the VPA, but the existence of previous research showing such anxiolytic properties (that was already mentioned in the original ms, and that is now more deeply discussed in the revised version &#8211; see lines 598-614) can also be considered as strong support for our interpretation.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Minor concerns:&#8232;1) Lines 148-149: List groups in same order (in text) as listed in Table 1.</p><p>Done. In addition, we have also changed the term &#8216;Val&#8217; for &#8216;VPA&#8217; in the Figures and in the text to homogenize the groups&#8217; names across all experiments. </p><p>2) Clarify whether Figure 1B represents total consumption (minutes 1-60) or consumption for minutes 30-60.</p><p>Figure 1B represents total consumption (minutes 1-60). It has been clarified in the first paragraph of the results section for Experiment 1 (p. 9, lines 204, 210 and 214), and in the Figure 1 caption.</p><p>&#8232;3) Line 411: change &#8220;free-drug&#8221; to &#8220;drug-free&#8221;</p><p>Done</p><p>&#8232;4) It would be useful to include a direct assessment of footshock reactivity during acquisition in Exp 3 (e.g., activity burst; Fanselow, 1982).&#8232;Fanselow, Michael S. &#8220;The Postshock Activity Burst.&#8221; Animal Learning &amp; Behavior, vol. 10, no. 4, Nov. 1982, pp. 448&#8211;54.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that including a direct assessment of footshock reactivity would be very useful for a better understanding of fear conditioning but, unfortunately, we only registered percent of locomotor activity for the complete ITI and CS duration and, consequently, we cannot identify the specific duration of activity bursts or any other indications of footshock reactivity. We will introduce such index in our future research.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0279511.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewers.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0279511.s004.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0279511.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0279511.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Hrncic</surname><given-names initials="D">Dragan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Dragan Hrncic</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Dragan Hrncic</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0279511"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
