Introduction</title><p id="Par1">Advances in cancer drug therapy have led to improvements in the outcomes of cancer patients, as well as increasing numbers of patients undergoing anticancer chemotherapy and molecularly targeted drug therapy. One adverse event associated with cancer drug therapy is nephrotoxicity, which impedes effective cancer therapy and diminishes the quality of life of cancer patients. Consequently, onco-nephrology has emerged as a new clinical field concerned with the management of nephrotoxicity in cancer drug therapy, creating expectations for advanced expertise and the accumulation of accurate evidence. However, while patients with renal impairment have heretofore undergone planning regarding administration of cancer drug therapy, procedures for nephropathy prevention, and measures for treatment of drug-induced nephrotoxicity in clinical settings based on tradition, experimental rules, and information from clinical trials, the soundness of the evidence for these practices has been uncertain.</p><p id="Par2">Over the past 10 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has replaced creatinine clearance in the assessment of renal function; in addition, research has revealed the pathologies of and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). The objectives of the guidelines presented here are to support improvements in the results of cancer drug therapy and the quality of life of cancer patients through application of these advances in clinical nephrology and the practice of evidence-based treatment.</p><p id="Par3">For these guidelines, we have assembled a group of Japanese experts on cancer drug therapy and nephrology to select highly important clinical questions that are frequently encountered in everyday practice. These guidelines ultimately comprise 16 clinical questions in two chapters regarding assessment of renal function and prevention of nephropathy during cancer drug therapy, thereby determining the level of evidence to support clinical assessments and elucidating the nature of current standard treatments. However, in drafting these guidelines, we discovered a number of clinical issues (evidence gaps) regarding cancer drug therapy and renal impairment. For example, 1) there is very little clinical research on cancer drug therapy and nephropathy to begin with; 2) many clinical trials continue to use creatinine clearance to assess renal function; 3) in assessments of renal function in large populations, there is a vast discrepancy between eGFR and measured values of GFR; and 4) it remains unknown whether body surface area corrections of drug doses are appropriate for elderly patients (who have reduced muscle mass) or obese patients. These and other evidence gaps must be resolved for the sake of future research.</p><p id="Par4">These guidelines were drafted with reference to the &#8220;Minds Treatment Guideline Creation Companion 2014&#8221; using the Minds Guideline Creation support tool &#8220;GUIDE&#8221;. We would like to express our profound gratitude to Doctors Tsuguya Fukui and Takeo Nakayama of Minds for their roles as advisors in the creation of our guidelines.</p><p id="Par5">We would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the many young physicians of the systematic review team for their contributions in drafting structured abstracts.</p><p id="Par6">The primary significance of treatment guidelines is their application in daily clinical practice. We would appreciate any criticisms or ideas that would be useful in future revisions of these guidelines.</p><p id="Par7">Shigeo Horie, M.D.</p><p id="Par8">Professor and Chairman,</p><p id="Par9">Department of Urology</p><p id="Par10">Juntendo University, Graduate School of Medicine</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>2. On the Occasion of Publication</title><p id="Par11">Cancer has been the leading cause of death among Japanese people for many years; currently, cancer is responsible for approximately 30% of all deaths in Japan. As the Japanese population ages, this figure will continue to increase year after year. Therefore, further development of treatment measures against cancer is undoubtedly one of the most crucial issues for the Japanese population. One such measure is drug therapy, which is widely performed. Many anticancer drugs are strongly associated with effects on various organs; a sufficient understanding of these associations is a prerequisite for effective and successful cancer drug therapy. Unfortunately, there have been no guidelines regarding cancer drug therapy in relation to associations with individual organs. Medical staffs and individuals involved in the treatment of cancer have a great interest for the relevance of the anti-cancer agent and a kidney. However, no previous guidelines exist that systematically described the association between cancer drug therapy and the kidneys.</p><p id="Par12">In addition to chronic kidney disease, the concept of acute kidney injury has rapidly become widespread in recent years. As renal function assessment methods and biomarkers continue to develop, evolutions in nephropathy concepts are being observed.</p><p id="Par13">Against this backdrop, the Japanese Society of Nephrology, the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology, the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, and the Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy have jointly published the &#8220;2016 Guidelines for the Treatment of Nephropathy in Cancer Pharmacotherapy&#8221;; the timely and fascinating publication of these guidelines marks a major step in the development of cancer pharmacotherapy. This is truly a document that individuals involved in cancer treatment have long awaited. I sincerely hope that this document will be used appropriately and effectively by all individuals who work on cancer treatment.</p><p id="Par14">Lastly, I would like to express my deep gratitude to everyone involved in the drafting of these guidelines.</p><p id="Par15">Seiichi Matsuo, MD. PhD.</p><p id="Par16">President, Japanese Society of Nephrology</p><p id="Par17">(President, Nagoya University)</p><p id="Par18">As the Japanese population continues to age, physicians engaged in cancer pharmacotherapy increasingly encounter patients with organ dysfunction due to comorbid diseases; however, there is a lack of information regarding appropriate cancer pharmacotherapy for cancer patients with comorbid nephropathy. Currently, package inserts for the majority of anticancer drugs contain no clear information regarding administration in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although nephropathy is a major adverse event elicited by cancer pharmacotherapy, regimens for the prevention of nephropathy are currently modified based on the experience of individual physicians and the customs of individual facilities.</p><p id="Par19">The present guidelines begin with renal function assessment methods necessary for determining doses of anticancer drugs, followed by descriptions of supportive therapy during cancer pharmacotherapy with cisplatin and other drugs for patients with decreased renal function. The guidelines also discuss supportive therapy for maintenance dialysis patients and patients with specific comorbidities. I believe that these guidelines will prove useful in daily clinical practice.</p><p id="Par20">As part of its duties as a multidisciplinary academic society, the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology has been engaged in the formulation of guidelines for common supportive therapies for the treatment of cancer of various organs. Our society considers it greatly significant to have had the opportunity to participate in the formulation of these guidelines, which will contribute to improvements in the quality of treatment for patients with renal impairment.</p><p id="Par21">Lastly, I would like to express my profound gratitude to Doctor Shigeo Horie, President of the Guideline Preparation Committee, for his tireless leadership in the drafting of these guidelines, as well as the many others who devoted their efforts to drafting the guidelines.</p><p id="Par22">Yuko Kitagawa, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S.</p><p id="Par23">Chairman of Board of Directors, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology</p><p id="Par24">Professor and Chairman, Department of Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine</p><p id="Par25">Cancer is reported to afflict one in every two Japanese people and kill one in every three. As the Japanese population continues to age, the number of elderly cancer patients is likely to continue to increase. Consequently, an increase is also expected in the number of cancer patients with comorbidities such as nephropathy.</p><p id="Par26">In the use of anticancer drugs for cancer patients with nephropathy, consideration must be given to the possibility of the enhancement of adverse events owing to diminished excretion, as well as the possibility that the toxicity of anticancer drugs will exacerbate nephropathy. However, as effective anticancer drugs are not used based solely on comorbid nephropathy, the therapy cannot be considered appropriate.</p><p id="Par27">The performance of cancer pharmacotherapy in patients with nephropathy requires knowledge of not only oncology, but also nephrology. I believe that the joint creation of these guidelines by the Japanese Society of Nephrology, kidney specialists with the Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy, and cancer therapy specialists with the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology is incredibly important and significant for the performance of appropriate pharmacotherapy in cancer patients with nephropathy. These guidelines establish crucial clinical questions and provide clear descriptions about these questions.</p><p id="Par28">I anticipate that these guidelines will be utilized effectively by physicians, pharmacists, and nurses throughout Japan, and that they will be useful in the performance of appropriate anticancer drug therapy in cancer patients with nephropathy.</p><p id="Par29">Yuichiro Ohe</p><p id="Par30">National Cancer Center Hospital Department of Thoracic Oncology</p><p id="Par31">The Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy strives to foster &#8220;medical professionals who responsibly offer effective, safe, and the most appropriate drug therapy optimized to the individual patient&#8221;. Since the society was founded, it has worked toward fulfilling the following four major objectives: 1) to ensure the proper use of drugs and prevention of toxic side effects in patients with decreased renal function, 2) to prevent renal function deterioration and cardiovascular complications through proper medication guidance, 3) to provide appropriate drug therapy to dialysis patients with complications, and 4) to prevent drug-induced renal damage caused by nephrotoxic agents and drugs inducing renal ischemia. The Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy was granted the opportunity to create the &#8220;2016 Guidelines for the Treatment of Nephropathy in Cancer Pharmacotherapy&#8221; alongside the Japanese Society of Nephrology, the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology. The joint creation of these guidelines aligns with our own society&#8217;s goals, filling me with profound pride.</p><p id="Par32">Similar to antibacterial agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticancer drugs can easily cause drug-induced nephropathy. The renal function of a patient receiving anticancer drugs fluctuates easily due to the effects of various factors such as the patient&#8217;s condition, activity level, and age. Anticancer drug pharmacokinetics, anticancer drug interactions, and conceptions of patients&#8217; renal function are the fortes of our society, which specializes in nephrology and pharmacotherapy. In order to exert our specialized capacity, we recently established a Committee for the Formulation and Drafting of Guidelines. Going forward, with this committee at the center of our efforts, we hope to use our specialized perspective in relation to nephrology and pharmacotherapy to contribute to the drafting and revision of various types of practice and therapeutic guidelines.</p><p id="Par33">In conclusion, I earnestly hope that the use of these guidelines will lead to the implementation of safer, more effective cancer drug therapy in all medical care settings through the prevention of anticancer drug-induced irreversible nephropathy, as well as the reduction and prevention of side effects, achieved by the establishment of appropriate dosages for patients with decreased renal function, including elderly patients.</p><p id="Par34">Sumio Hirata,</p><p id="Par35">President of the Japansese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy.</p><p>Professor and Director, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Center for Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>3. Background</title><p id="Par36">Nephropathy is a major potential adverse event in cancer drug therapy. Anticancer chemotherapy, particularly in patients with comorbid chronic kidney disease, requires sufficient examination of the balance of the potential therapeutic benefit with the risk of decreased renal function. However, cancer drug therapy in clinical settings has been performed based solely on physicians&#8217; experience and instincts, a situation that calls for evidence-based guidelines.</p><p id="Par37">The objective of the present guidelines was to draft clinical questions (CQs) and recommendations for those CQs to be specifically applied in real-world clinical practice. The overwhelming diversity of drugs used to treat cancer involves equally diverse nephropathy pathologies and dose adjustments. In establishing CQs, we have attempted be as comprehensive as possible. These guidelines take into account consistency with not only existing guidelines, but also guidelines on acute kidney injury treatment currently under production (Japanese Society of Nephrology, Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, Japan Society for Blood Purification in Critical Care, Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Japanese Society for Pediatric Nephrology, etc.).</p><p id="Par38">In&#160;2016,&#160;Japanese Society of Nephrology, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology, Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, and The Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy established the Committee Of this guideline drafting group,&#160;which&#160;published&#160;Guidelines for treatment of renal injury during cancer chemotherapy 2016&#160;in&#160;Jpn J Nephrol. 2016; 58:985-1050.

Guideline objectives, assumed users, and social significance</title><p id="Par39">This document includes guidelines regarding nephropathy in patients undergoing cancer drug therapy. These guidelines are intended to serve as a basis for assessing CQs that are likely to be frequently encountered in daily practice; they have been written for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and all other medical personnel engaged in the treatment of cancer. The objective of the development of these guidelines was to support clinical assessments by obtaining answers as specific as possible regarding questions encountered in real-world practice by cancer specialists in order to convey current standard views and specifics of practice. However, we ultimately treat not cancer, but rather cancer patients; rather than performing individual medical acts uniformly, treatment should sufficiently respect each patient as an individual.</p><p id="Par40">It is hereby specified that these guidelines do not contain assessment criteria for medical disputes or medical lawsuits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>5. Patients targeted by the guidelines</title><p id="Par41">These guidelines are intended for the treatment of all adult cancer patients and not for pediatric cancer patients.

Administrative framework</title><p id="Par42">The drafting of these guidelines is characterized primarily by the participation of members from four different academic societies: the Japanese Society of Nephrology, the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology, the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, and the Japanese Society of Nephrology and Pharmacotherapy. The drafting of these guidelines brought together nearly all of the principal groups currently engaged in cancer treatment and kidney disease in Japan, thereby allowing us to integrate all views currently standard in Japan. Furthermore, these guidelines were drafted in reference to the &#8220;Minds Treatment Guideline Creation Companion 2014&#8221; using the Minds Guideline Creation support tool &#8220;GUIDE&#8221;. Therefore, Doctors Tsuguya Fukui and Takeo Nakayama of Minds participated as advisors. We would like to take this opportunity to express out profound gratitude for their unerring advice to the drafting committee and their efforts in keeping our discussions focused.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>7. Drafting method</title><p id="Par43">First, the drafting committee formulated and listed 101 CQs, of which they adopted 16. For each CQ, we established keywords for literature searches. After performing a literature search, the systematic review team assessed each piece of literature, the guideline drafting committee made their recommendations and provided explanations for these choices, and the boards of each academic society approved these choices based on public comments in each of their societies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>8. Systematic review</title><p id="Par44">We requested literature searches from the Japan Medical Library Association, on behalf of the systematic review team, with our searches open to all types of literature abstracted from the keywords. We searched for literature published from 1970 to 2014; the databases searched were PubMed, Ichushi-Web, and the Cochrane Library. Evidence was assessed in accordance with the Minds Treatment Guideline Creation Companion 2014 (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The systematic review team performed primary screening and secondary screening, and drafted an assessment sheet. All CQ database search results and literature assessment sheets were posted on each academic society&#8217;s website.

</p><p id="Par64">Summary</p><p id="Par65">When assessing renal function for adjusting anticancer drug doses, eGFR is recommended if the patient&#8217;s condition is normal for their age and gender, i.e., if the patient is not malnourished, severely emaciated, or severely obese. For patients whose muscle mass differs markedly from standard values due to malnourishment or severe emaciation, eGFR may not accurately reflect GFR. In such cases, rather than estimating GFR from serum Cr levels, combination with another method is recommended, such as measurement of GFR based on urine collection. For agents for which doses are fixed regardless of patient condition, the dose should be adjusted in accordance with creatinine clearance (Ccr) or eGFR (mL/min) without correcting for body surface area. For agents for which the dose is determined by body surface area in accordance with the patient&#8217;s condition, it is reasonable to use Ccr corrected for body surface area (per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or eGFR corrected for body surface area (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). In the Cockcroft-Gault equation, Ccr (mL/min) is calculated using serum Cr values determined with the Jaff&#233; method. When using Cr values determined with an enzymatic method, as is the standard in Japan, 0.2 is added to the actual Cr value.</p><p id="Par66">Background and Objectives</p><p id="Par67">In order to conduct anticancer chemotherapy safely and effectively, it is important to establish appropriate doses to elicit maximum anticancer effects and minimize side effects. When renal function is impaired, renally excreted drugs accumulate in the kidneys, potentially resulting in serious side effects; therefore, anticancer drug doses must be adjusted in accordance with renal function.</p><p id="Par68">Estimated GFR is used to assess renal function. Outside of Japan, GFR is measured based on clearance of chromium (Cr) 51-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and iodine (I)-125 sodium iothalamate, which are the respective GFR substances EDTA and iothalamate marked with radioisotopes of chromium and iodine, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; in Japan, the gold standard is inulin clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, measurement of GFR requires urine collection following intravenous injection of exogenous clearance substances marked with inulin or radioactive material, thus making testing cumbersome. Therefore, Ccr and GFR are typically estimated based on serum Cr. Although various formulas have been devised for estimating GFR (Note 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], most of these are intended for patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy individuals; their efficacy for cancer patients has not been sufficiently verified.</p><p id="Par69">For patients with renal impairment, dose adjustments are often based on pharmacokinetic data at the time of clinical trials. Many trials of dose adjustment tailored to renal function have used Ccr as calculated from the Cockcroft-Gault equation. In 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidance for pharmacokinetics research in patients with impaired renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to the conventional use of Ccr based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the guidance document also proposed the use of eGFR based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation; consequently, for drugs developed in the future, dose adjustments based on eGFR may become the norm. Proposed revised guidelines from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also describe assessment of renal function using eGFR based on the MDRD equation and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Japan, the Guideline for Clinical Evaluation of Oral Hypoglycemic Agents published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare stipulates that renal function indicators (eGFR, Ccr, etc.) are recommended for assessment of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although this guideline is not related to drug dose adjustments, it shows that eGFR may be used frequently to assess renal function in clinical trials in Japan going forward.</p><p id="Par70">The objectives of this draft are to examine existing findings on renal function assessment in the administration of anticancer drugs, and to determine the usefulness and limitations of this assessment in real-world settings.</p><p id="Par71">Commentary</p><p id="Par72">Renal excretion of drugs occurs by glomerular filtration and tubular excretion; however, because there is no simple method for quantitatively assessing the drug excretion function of renal tubules, drug dose adjustments are typically based on GFR. Likewise, in the development of novel agents, doses are often established based on GFR or on Ccr, which reflects GFR. Therefore, GFR has been established as the reference for adjusting doses of anticancer drugs.</p><p id="Par73">Measurement of GFR requires measurement of the clearance of a substance that is completely filtered by glomeruli, does not bind to proteins, is not metabolized in the body, and is not secreted or reabsorbed by renal tubules. In Japan, the gold standard is inulin clearance; other countries, however, measure clearance of substances such as 51Cr-EDTA, I-125 sodium iothalamate, or iohexol. Although Ccr is sometimes measured in place of GFR, measurement of Ccr (enzymatic method) yields values 20&#8211;30% higher than measurements of GFR based on inulin clearance. This discrepancy arises from the fact that Cr is not only filtered by glomeruli, but also secreted by renal tubules; consequently, GFR &#8776; Ccr &#215; 0.715 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The use of these methods in clinical settings is constrained by the need for administration of reagents and urine collection, as well as a certain length of time before results are reported. These constraints have resulted in the development of equations for estimating GFR and Cr based on serum Cr levels.</p><p id="Par74">Conventionally, drug doses have generally been adjusted using Ccr as estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation. However, because Ccr estimates are higher than GFR values, several different equations have been developed for the accurate estimation of GFR; these equations are now also used to adjust drug doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Most equations for calculating eGFR and Ccr were developed for use in healthy individuals and CKD patients; few such equations are intended for use in cancer patients. Although the Wright formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the Martin formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the Jelliffe equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are intended for the estimation of GFR in cancer patients, no method has been developed for estimating GFR specifically in Japanese cancer patients. Therefore, in regard to the CQ of whether eGFR is recommended for assessment of renal function for the adjustment of anticancer drug doses, we conducted literature searches upon establishing the following two questions: &#8220;Is eGFR based on serum Cr values an appropriate substitute for the gold standard of GFR based on clearance of inulin, 51Cr-EDTA, or I-125 sodium iothalamate?&#8221; and &#8220;Is eGFR an appropriate substitute for conventional Ccr calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation?&#8221; We found 12 studies that compared actual GFR to eGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], three studies that compared actual Ccr to eGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and three studies that compared Ccr as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation to formulas for eGFR and other such predictive formulas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Results are inconsistent among studies that have examined the validities of various predictive formulas for cancer patients; this lack of consistency is assumed to potentially lead to the overestimation and underestimation of true GFR within a certain range. Overestimation of GFR can result in excessive doses of anticancer drugs and increased risk of side effects, while underestimation of GFR can lead to insufficient doses of anticancer drugs and a consequent attenuation of anticancer action. Few studies have compared actual GFR to eGFR as calculated with the Japanese Society of Nephrology&#8217;s equation in Japanese cancer patients; thus, further research is desirable. Research is also necessary to assess the usefulness of equations for estimating GFR based on serum cystatin C rather than serum Cr. Most studies compare eGFR to the gold standard of actual GFR; no studies have examined therapeutic effects and side effects resulting from administration of anticancer drugs based on eGFR. Research is also needed on clinical outcomes comparing the use of eGFR to the use of actual GFR or the use of Ccr as estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation.</p><p id="Par76">At present, eGFR as calculated with the Japanese Society of Nephrology&#8217;s equation yields an approximate assessment of renal function; if renal function is normal, anticancer drug dose adjustment can be considered unnecessary. However, in the adjustment of doses based on data from clinical trials, it is safe to use the same renal function assessment methods and predictive equations. No matter which predictive equation is used, for patients with a markedly abnormal condition whose renal function necessitates anticancer drug dose adjustment or who are borderline for such adjustment, rather than using eGFR based on serum Cr value, it is safer to use a combination of other methods such as actual GFR based on urine collection (Note 2) and GFR as estimated based on cystatin C. Although actual GFR based on urine collection and inulin clearance is preferable, when these are difficult to implement, GFR can be approximated by multiplying Ccr (enzymatic method) by 0.715 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">When performing dose adjustments in accordance with Ccr or GFR, the following point must be noted: when assessing Ccr and GFR, the decision of whether to correct for body surface area is related to the method of measuring serum Cr value using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.</p><p id="Par78">Drug doses are either fixed (mg/day) regardless of the patient&#8217;s condition (body weight and body surface area) or tailored to the patient&#8217;s condition (body weight and body surface area). In the use of agents for which the dose is fixed regardless of condition, the dose is adjusted in accordance with Ccr or eGFR (mL/min) without correcting for body surface area (Note 3). In regard to this point, the Japanese Society of Nephrology-edited 2012 CKD Practice Guide recommends the following: &#8220;When using renally excreted agents for patients with diminished renal function, renal function should be assessed with eGFR (mL/min) without correcting for body surface area, doses should be reduced, and administration intervals should be prolonged&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The EMA Guideline on the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients with decreased renal function also recommends that GFR be measured and recorded without correcting for body surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, in the use of agents for which doses are established based on body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and body weight (mg/kg), it is reasonable to use Ccr corrected for body surface area (per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or eGFR corrected for body surface area (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Doing so is reasonable because when using Ccr or GFR per mL/min for correction in the use of agents for which the dose is adjusted in accordance with body surface area, the double-counting of patient condition leads to excessive doses for large-bodied patients and insufficient doses for small-bodied patients. Ccr values as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation are in mL/min without correcting for body surface area, whereas in the MDRD equation and the Japanese Society of Nephrology eGFR equation, Ccr values are corrected per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Therefore, caution is necessary when applying these equations.</p><p id="Par79">In Japan, Cr values are often measured with an enzymatic method; however, it must be noted that the Cockcroft-Gault equation uses Cr values determined with the Jaff&#233; method. In the Jaff&#233; method, Cr values are 0.2 mg/dL higher than Cr values determined with an enzymatic method; therefore, when calculating Cockcroft-Gault Ccr using Cr values determined with an enzymatic method, 0.2 is added to the enzymatic test Cr value.</p><p id="Par80">Although some patients who undergo cancer drug therapy for urinary tract tumors possess only one kidney, eGFR reflects the aggregate function of both kidneys; therefore, eGFR can also be used for patients with only a single kidney.</p><p id="Par81">* Note 1: Renal function estimation equations</p><p id="Par82">1) Cockcroft-Gault equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]<disp-formula id="Equ1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

</p><p id="Par112">2) Background and objectives</p><p id="Par113">Anticancer drugs frequently result in kidney injury; they are considered to account for 15% of all cases of drug-induced kidney injury, the third-leading cause of these injuries, following antibacterial agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Anticancer drugs are also known to result in AKI; AKI occurred in 36% of a group of 537 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent induction chemotherapy, while 61.7% of patients who developed ESRD died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A separate study reported an extremely high mortality rate of 73% among cancer patients with comorbid AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Anticancer drug-induced AKI not only increases the risk of CKD and ESRD, but also requires adjustment of anticancer drug doses due to decreased renal function, thus interfering with the impending administration of the next anticancer drug. Due to the wide variety of chemotherapy regimens, AKI presents with a wide variety of clinical symptoms. Examples of anticancer drug-induced AKI are shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A classic example of a tubular disorder-inducing drug is platinum-based agents, which primarily result in disorders in the tubulointerstitium. For example, cisplatin is known to cause AKI in approximately one-third of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

</p><p id="Par114">Although the emergence of the RIFLE and AKIN classifications, which are based on serum Cr and urinary output, have resulted in significant advances in the diagnosis of AKI, many issues remain. Serum Cr is affected by several factors such as age, body weight, sex differences, other agents, muscle metabolism, protein intake, and hypervolemia; thus, it is deeply flawed as a biomarker of AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, elevated serum Cr does not manifest until 48-72 hours after the initial occurrence of nephrotoxicity, thus hindering prompt AKI diagnosis and therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To compensate for the flaws of serum Cr, the usefulness of many novel biomarkers of AKI has been examined. However, the clinical use of novel biomarkers of AKI still faces high hurdles due to the need to establish threshold values in accordance with sex differences, age differences, and primary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par115">The objectives of this guideline are to examine the latest findings regarding biomarkers for AKI induced by anticancer drugs, and to determine the usefulness and limitations of these biomarkers in real-world clinical settings.</p><p id="Par116">Commentary</p><p id="Par117">The biomarkers discussed in this draft can be assessed objectively and serve as indicators of pharmacological responses to biological changes, histological changes, and therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Biomarkers of anticancer drug-induced AKI must be immune to interference from all types of treatment. Potential roles for biomarkers include: 1) risk assessment, 2) early diagnosis, 3) classification of disease stage, 4) differential diagnosis, 5) indication of therapeutic effects, and 6) determination of prognosis. Anticipation is particularly high for the practical application of biomarkers that enable earlier diagnosis than do serum Cr and eGFR.</p><p id="Par118">The present draft divides biomarkers into two categories: those that can be used in clinical practice and are covered by health insurance in Japan, and those that cannot. Also, in 2010, the Predictive Safety Testing Consortium&#8217;s Nephrotoxicity Working Group submitted results for drug toxicity studies and analyses of biomarker performance to the FDA and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency; these results presented Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1), urinary albumin, urine protein, &#946;2 microglobulin, serum cystatin C, clusterin, and trefoil factor 3 (TFF-3) as biomarkers related to renal function safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

In fact, short-term and long-term administrations of nephrotoxic anticancer drugs have been reported to increase levels of urinary microalbumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, urinary albumin levels are known to increase not only as a result of AKI, but also due to factors such as fever, exercise, dehydration, diabetes, and hypertension; thus, the specificity of urinary albumin as a biomarker of AKI is considered limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>b) Urine protein</title><p id="Par120">In detection of glomerular disease, urine protein is said to be superior to BUN and serum Cr in terms of diagnostic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; however, urine protein is reported to have low specificity as a biomarker of AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and its usefulness has not been established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>c) Serum cystatin C</title><p id="Par121">Cystatin is the most important cysteine protease inhibitor in the human body. Cystatin C, a 13-kDa protein secreted by all nucleated cells, is characterized by the fact that it does not bind to plasma proteins. Therefore, cystatin C is freely filtered by the renal glomeruli; after being reabsorbed by the proximal tubules, more than 99% of it is degraded by the endocytic receptor megalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Unlike Cr, cystatin C is not secreted by the renal tubules into urine, and its levels are not dependent on sex or muscle mass. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, serum cystatin C is well correlated with GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]; thus, cystatin C can be used to detect nephrotoxicity at an early stage with greater sensitivity than serum Cr, thus making serum cystatin C a potentially useful biomarker of AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, serum cystatin C is limited in the following two ways: 1) it is affected by diabetes, high levels of corticosteroids, hyperthyroidism, inflammation, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]; 2) when GFR reaches &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the increase in serum cystatin C slows and levels off at 5-6 mg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Ben&#246;hr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] have demonstrated that serum cystatin C levels are significantly elevated on day 5 following cisplatin administration compared to 3 days prior to administration. At present, serum cystatin C has not been established as a useful biomarker of anticancer drug-induced AKI.

In fact, urinary &#946;2 microglobulin has been reported to increase 4-5 days earlier than does serum Cr in tubular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

Goren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] compared concentrations of NAG before and after cisplatin administration in 12 patients. In their investigation, concentrations of NAG increased following cisplatin administration, reached their peak on day 3, and subsequently decreased. In an examination of NAG and &#946;2 microglobulin in 8 patients before and after cisplatin administration, Ikeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] reported that &#946;2 microglobulin reached peak levels on day 3 and decreased to pretreatment levels in 1 week, although only 1 patient demonstrated increased NAG for 2 weeks. However, urinary NAG activity is inhibited by many nephrotoxic substances, magnesium, and endogenous urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Furthermore, urinary NAG levels are increased not only in AKI, but also in rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and hyperthyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]; thus, the specificity of urinary NAG for AKI is considered low.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>f) Urinary L-FABP</title><p id="Par124">Liver fatty acid-binding protein is a fatty acid transport protein that is expressed in the proximal tubule and that possesses antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

In addition, a systematic review reported fluctuation of Kim-1 within 24 hours of kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The United States FDA has approved Kim-1 as a marker of AKI. Tekce et al.

On day 1, there were no significant differences between the groups in serum Cr, eGFR, or serum Kim-1; however, urinary Kim-1 levels were significantly higher in the AKI group. On day 3, the two groups demonstrated significant differences in serum Cr, eGFR, and urinary Kim-1; however, there were no significant differences in serum Kim-1. Thus, urinary Kim-1 demonstrates potential as an early marker of cisplatin-induced AKI.

Although a significant difference between the AKI group and the non-AKI group in serum Cr was first observed on day 3 following cisplatin administration, a significant difference in NGAL was first observed on day 1.

Different drugs induce nephrotoxicity via different mechanisms, while some drugs (cisplatin, etc.) are assumed to act via multiple mechanisms; therefore, assessment with a single biomarker may not be valid (in fact, a study has demonstrated the usefulness of a combination of multiple biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). 5) When using serum, the possibility cannot be ruled out that what is being assessed is not AKI, but rather the effects of anticancer drugs throughout the body.

The involvement of smoking in nephrotoxicity has been surmised to be the effect of oxidant stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]; however, one possibility that cannot be ruled out is that smoking causes cardiovascular disease, which secondarily leads to post-cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Also, in hypoalbuminemia, an increased concentration of unbound cisplatin is considered to enhance nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. The cited study, which defines nephrotoxicity as a reduction in Ccr of &#8805; 25%, is not strictly an assessment of predictors of AKI.</p><p id="Par157">In an investigation of 425 patients treated with cisplatin (total dose 220 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [median]), Stewart et al.

However, this study contains flaws: renal function was assessed with serum Cr alone, and the authors&#8217; method of assessing maximum increases in serum Cr up to 4 weeks after cisplatin treatment is neither a well-established method nor period for assessment. Furthermore, anticancer drugs were used in combination with many other drugs; thus, the degree to which cisplatin contributes to changes in renal function is unknown.</p><p id="Par158">In an examination of 1,721 patients treated with cisplatin, Mizuno et al.

Nephrotoxicity is often prevented or alleviated by hydration via large-volume fluid replacement, or by administration of magnesium. Although some physicians prefer to use divided doses of platinum-based agents to prevent or alleviate nephrotoxicity, some studies with pediatric cancer patients have reported that nephrotoxicity is less frequent with continuous drug administration than with divided doses. The present draft examines the recommendation level for the current practice of administering divided doses of cisplatin with the intention of alleviating nephrotoxicity.</p><p id="Par167">Commentary</p><p id="Par168">At present, there are no articles detailing prospective randomized clinical trials on divided doses of platinum-based agents with alleviation of nephrotoxicity as the primary endpoint.

The content and results of these studies are summarized below.</p><p id="Par169">Forasteiere et al. compared 5 divided, intermittent doses of cisplatin (each administered over 20 minutes) to the same total dose administered via continuous infusion (24 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. The subjects were patients with head and neck cancer; 6 patients received cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> via continuous infusion (24 hours) for 5 days, while another 5 patients received cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> via intermittent intravenous bolus (20 minutes) for 5 days; the two groups were compared in terms of total platinum concentration, free platinum concentration, and adverse events. Although the continuous infusion group demonstrated an extremely low maximum unbound platinum concentration compared to the intermittent bolus group, the exposure to unbound platinum (AUC) was 1.5-2 times higher in the continuous infusion group. An assessment of subclinical nephrotoxicity based on measurement of urinary excretion of the renal enzymes NAG and alanine found no differences between the two groups in nephrotoxicity, or in hearing loss or nausea/vomiting. In contrast, myelosuppression and hypomagnesemia were observed frequently in the continuous infusion group, suggesting that total platinum exposure contributes to nephrotoxicity more than does peak concentration. Because adverse events in continuous administration were clinically acceptable, the authors recommended larger-scale trials with continuous infusion of cisplatin. However, because this study compared two forms of divided doses against each other, the merits of divided doses remain unknown.</p><p id="Par170">Ikeda et al. investigated the optimal administration method for combined 5-FU + cisplatin therapy in patients with gastric cancer and esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].

In all three groups, 5-FU was continuously infused at a dose of 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (24 hours) for 5 days. The authors concluded that continuous infusion is the pharmacokinetically optimal administration method; however, this method has not been recognized to be superior in terms of adverse events.</p><p id="Par171">Takahashi et al. also compared pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity according to different cisplatin administration methods (5 divided doses, 24 hours continuous infusion, 12 hours continuous infusion, 6 hours continuous infusion); they found no differences in clinical adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>].</p><p id="Par172">The above-cited three studies found no difference in nephrotoxicity based on the cisplatin administration method; thus, there is no basis for the active recommendation of divided doses. Therefore, due to the current absence of appropriately designed studies, there is no basis for actively recommending divided doses of cisplatin for the prevention of nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#8217;s 2014 bladder cancer guidelines state that divided doses (35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 2 or days 1 and 8) may be considered for patients with borderline renal function or minimal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. However, no references are cited for these proposed divided doses. In addition, the therapeutic effect of divided doses is unclear.</p><p id="Par173">Nonetheless, some believe that continuous administration of cisplatin is safe for preventing and alleviating nephrotoxicity. Erdlenbruch et al. compared pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity between two groups: a group of 4 pediatric osteosarcoma patients who received continuous infusion of 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin over 72 hours, and a group of 6 pediatric medulloblastoma patients who received 1-hour bolus infusions of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin per day for 3 consecutive days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>].

Most of the existing relevant literature consists of reviews that discuss nephrotoxicity. As a basis for recommending fluid replacement, one typical review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] cites an animal trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] that divided dogs into a control group, a prehydration group, and a mannitol infusion group; nephrotoxicity was alleviated in the latter two groups. Many other reviews have also recommended forced diuresis with hydration and diuretics. Cisplatin was developed in the 1970s; as a result of the different development methodologies of today, as well as the fact that cisplatin was known early in its development to be nephrotoxic, the absence of validation studies in human subjects is considered inevitable. Consequently, the quality of the evidence is assessed as extremely poor (D: Almost no confidence in effect estimates).</p><p id="Par183">In the evidence for various existing cancer drug therapies, implementation plans prescribe normal hydration when using cisplatin. For other platinum-based agents (carboplatin, etc.), hydration is not typically prescribed. The Japanese package insert for cisplatin states in the dosage section that hydration is to be performed before, during, and after administration; however, the package insert for carboplatin does not contain such instructions. In the United States as well, the package insert for cisplatin calls for hydration, whereas the package insert for carboplatin does not (rather, it specifies that, unlike with cisplatin, massive hydration and forced diuresis are normally not to be performed).</p><p id="Par184">In consideration of the above information, and of the balance between benefits and risks, hydration during cisplatin administration is strongly recommended. Hydration is not recommended during administration of other platinum-based agents such as carboplatin. In the past, hydration during cisplatin administration commonly consisted of approximately 2 L saline solution or half-normal saline solution prior to cisplatin and &#8805; 1 L saline solution or half-normal saline solution after cisplatin.

Following administration of approximately 2,000 mL saline solution and furosemide over the course of 4 hours on the day of cisplatin administration, nephrotoxicity resulted in withdrawal of chemotherapy in 5 of 107 subjects (4.6%); among these 5 subjects, 2 demonstrated Grade 2 nephrotoxicity according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. In Japan, Horinouchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] and Hotta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>] have conducted small-scale prospective trials with patients who received 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin, respectively. With short hydration incorporating potassium, magnesium, and mannitol, elevations in serum Cr of Grade 2 or higher (based on the reference range upper limit in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.0) occurred in 2.2% (1/44) and 0% (0/46) of subjects, respectively.

The short hydration method assessed in the present CQ is as follows: a total of approximately 1,600-2,500 mL fluid is replaced over the course of approximately 4 hours; potassium and magnesium are supplemented; and urinary output is established via diuretics (furosemide and mannitol). In contrast, the United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network presents a chemotherapy order template of a total of 1,000-3,000 mL hydration before and after cisplatin administration at a rate of 250-500 mL/h for many carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>].

These target patients fulfill conditions such as the following: age &lt; 75 years, serum Cr value below the center&#8217;s reference value, Ccr &#8805; 60 mL/min, PS of 0-1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, no pleural effusion or ascites, cardiac function capable of withstanding approximately 500 mL/h hydration (left ventricular ejection fraction &#8805; 60% on echocardiography, etc.), completion of appropriate antiemetic therapy, and ability to receive approximately 1,000 mL/day oral hydration from day 0 to day 3 of cisplatin administration. Therefore, consciousness of disease and assurance of adherence are important when selecting patients. In addition, in the event of serious side effects or insufficient water intake, fluid replacement should be performed at a center that can adapt rapidly to such circumstances. All of the target studies were observational studies; therefore, the quality of the overall evidence was initially graded as C (weak). There were judged no serious problems with risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, or publication bias, all of which downgrade the quality of evidence.

</p><p id="Par228">To calculate doses, the previously established target AUC and the patient&#8217;s GFR are entered into the Calvert formula. Based on clinical trials, AUC is set at 5-7; however, analysis of a model for ovarian cancer patients demonstrates that while the antitumor effect of carboplatin nearly plateaus at an AUC of 5-7, thrombocytopenia and other forms of hematotoxicity are enhanced as AUC increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. Similar formulas for calculating carboplatin doses based on renal function have been created by Egorin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>] and Chatelut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]; however, the Calvert formula remains the most widely used due to its simplicity. In any case, setting dosages based on renal function is reasonable. However, no clinical trial has prospectively examined the setting of doses based on renal function from the perspective of increasing therapeutic effects and reducing side effects in comparison to typical methods based on body surface area; thus, the evidence for setting doses base on renal function is insufficient.</p><p id="Par229">In the process of creating the Calvert formula, the investigators employed actual GFR based on clearance of EDTA labeled with <sup>51</sup>Cr, a radioisotope of chromium. In Japan, the gold standard for GFR is inulin clearance; although measurement of inulin clearance is covered by health insurance, the procedure is cumbersome, and thus, Ccr is often used instead in daily clinical practice. However, not only does serum Cr undergo glomerular filtration, approximately 20-30% of it is secreted from the renal tubules; consequently, Ccr yields higher values than does GFR, a point which requires caution. The serum Cr values used to calculate Ccr are measured with the Jaff&#233; method and an enzymatic method. The Jaff&#233; method is affected by non-specific substances in serum; therefore, the measured value of serum Cr is approximately 0.2 mg/dL higher than the true serum Cr value. However, in calculations of Ccr, this measurement error is cancelled out by the difference with GFR resulting from tubular secretion; therefore, in effect, Ccr calculated with serum Cr as determined by the Jaff&#233; method approximates GFR. With an enzymatic method, on the other hand, serum Cr measurements are precise, and Ccr values are higher than GFR values. Consequently, the Calvert formula, which uses Ccr as a substitute for GFR, engenders a risk of excessive carboplatin dosing. Since the mid-1990s, most medical centers in Japan have used the enzymatic method, whereas the United States and Europe have used the Jaff&#233; method until recently. Caution is necessary when interpreting clinical trials of carboplatin conducted outside Japan. One proposed measure is to add 0.2 to enzymatic method-based serum Cr values when calculating Ccr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. When GFR is used, it is calculated with the Japanese Society of Nephrology&#8217;s GFR estimation formula (eGFR) without correcting for body surface area (see CQ1). However, many Japanese clinical trials currently use Ccr calculated from enzymatic method-based serum Cr values in place of GFR. When evidence from these trials is used in clinical practice, regardless of the presence of evident bias between the actual AUC and the target AUC, what is effectively being used is GFR estimated with the same methods as in the relevant trials. However, considering the objective of individualized patient doses based on renal function, renal function should be accurately assessed from the clinical trial stage in order to prevent bias between actual AUC and target AUC.</p><p id="Par230">In the United States, since 2010, serum Cr has been measured by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, which are as accurate as the enzymatic method. Accordingly, establishing an upper limit for the GFR used in the Calvert formula (125 mL/min) is recommended to avoid the excessive carboplatin dosing that would result from overestimation of renal function. In gynecology, for extremely low serum Cr, a lower limit (0.7 mg/dL) is sometimes established. With these methods, it must be noted that actual AUC is larger than target AUC in the majority of patients, while actual AUC is smaller than target AUC in some patients with favorable renal function.</p><p id="Par231">The &#8220;GFR+25&#8221; component of the Calvert formula corresponds to total carboplatin clearance; &#8220;GFR&#8221; corresponds to renal clearance, while the constant &#8220;25&#8221; corresponds to non-renal clearance. Non-renal clearance depends primarily on an individual&#8217;s physical size. The Calvert formula was created in the United Kingdom; when using the Calvert formula for Japanese individuals, who are physically smaller on average than Caucasians, the proportion of non-renal clearance increases relative to GFR, particularly in patients with severely decreased renal function, thereby potentially leading to excessive carboplatin dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>].</p><p id="Par232">Measurement of Ccr requires urine collection (typically for 24 hours); thus, estimates calculated based on serum Cr values are sometimes used as a substitute for GFR. Formulas for estimating Ccr include the Cockcroft-Gault equation and the Jelliffe equation. Formulas for estimating GFR in the United States and Europe include the MDRD equation, the CKD-EPI equation, and the Wright formula; for Japanese patients, the previously described GFR estimation formula (eGFR) is used (see CQ1). When using these formulas, the patient&#8217;s background (e.g., racial differences and pathologies) and the serum Cr measurement method must be noted. Furthermore, these formulas presume that serum Cr is stable; when renal function fluctuates markedly (such as in the acute phase of renal failure) or when muscle mass is greatly reduced (such as in sarcopenia or undernutrition), renal function will be overestimated.</p><p id="Par364">(3) Other agents</p><p id="Par365">

In animal experiments, methotrexate nephrotoxicity has been shown to arise from the accumulation of methotrexate or its metabolite 7-OH-MTX in the renal tubules. The solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites depends on urinary pH; this solubility is considered to increase five- to eight-fold with an increase in pH from 6.0 to 7.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue was developed in the 1970s with the following theoretical basis: when high-dose (generally &#8805; 500-1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) methotrexate is administered, the methotrexate is passively incorporated into cancer cells; after a certain amount of time has elapsed, leucovorin is administered as a methotrexate antidote and is passively incorporated by healthy cells capable of doing so, thereby rescuing those cells. Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue has been demonstrated as effective against osteosarcoma, acute leukemia, and malignant lymphoma; however, in the 1970s, the frequency of drug-related deaths was at a high rate of approximately 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. The pathological explanation for these drug-related deaths emphasized the following: methotrexate nephrotoxicity results in delayed excretion of methotrexate itself, thereby aggravating myelosuppression and other serious adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Subsequently, in addition to diuresis with urine alkalinization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>] and sufficient hydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>], monitoring of blood methotrexate levels has become widespread, as have increased doses and prolonged administration of leucovorin based on serum methotrexate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. In accordance with these technical improvements, deaths related to methotrexate with leucovorin rescue have decreased; data for 3,887 cases of osteosarcoma aggregated in 2004 showed a rate of deaths related to methotrexate with leucovorin rescue of 0.08% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Based on the above, although there is no evidence from randomized comparative trials, the establishment of urinary output through urine alkalinization and sufficient hydration are recommended to prevent nephrotoxicity in methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. However, in the above-cited 2004 data, nephrotoxicity Grade &#8805; 2 (WHO criteria, serum Cr levels 1.5-3.0 &#215; upper limit of normal) was observed in 68 patients (1.8%); the methotrexate with leucovorin rescue-related mortality rate among these patients was 4.4%, thus remaining high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>].

Methotrexate is a small molecule with a molecular weight of only 454.44 and thus can be removed by hemodialysis. On the other hand, approximately 50% of methotrexate binds to proteins, and its volume of distribution is tens of liters; in 4 hours, hemodialysis removes only 10.8% of methotrexate (according to drug information).

The actions and adverse events of angiogenesis inhibitors differ from those of cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Proteinuria, like hypertension, is an adverse event that occurs during treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Proteinuria and microalbuminuria have been demonstrated to be independent risk factors for renal disease and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]; thus, when proteinuria manifests during administration of angiogenesis inhibitors, appropriate management is necessary. There are many different types of angiogenesis inhibitors, each of which is indicated for a different carcinoma and has a different treatment regimen. Angiogenesis inhibitors are administered upon initiation of drug therapy for carcinomas that in most cases occur in a solitary kidney, such as advanced renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, angiogenesis inhibitors are sometimes administered alone and also sometimes used as part of multidrug therapy. With this diverse background, the incidence of proteinuria during administration of angiogenesis inhibitors has been determined to differ for each individual agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. According to Japanese special drug use surveillance, during the administration of bevacizumab in 2,696 cases of advanced colorectal cancer, proteinuria occurred in 4.60% of cases; proteinuria was serious in 0.11% of these cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>].

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs dilate efferent arterioles, reduce intraglomerular pressure, and reduce proteinuria; therefore, administration of angiogenesis inhibitors must involve regular measurement of blood pressure, urinalysis for early detection of proteinuria, and proactive administration of antihypertensive agents for sufficient control of blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>].</p><p id="Par253">While the incidence of proteinuria is different for each individual angiogenesis inhibitor, the risk of proteinuria is considered to be dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>].

Therefore, the answer to the present CQ can be considered to be, &#8220;Even when dialysis is performed following cisplatin administration, not only is the cisplatin removal rate roughly a mere 10%, a rebound phenomenon occurs; therefore, regardless of timing (whether immediately after cisplatin or 30 minutes to 1 hour after cisplatin), dialysis is not recommended for the removal of cisplatin&#8221;. However, this is an only an expert opinion based on case reports; further clinical study is necessary to close the evidence-to-practice gap. When cisplatin is administered to dialysis patients, a 50-75% dose reduction is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>].

Compared to uric acid, allantoin is much more soluble in urine; this metabolism thus rapidly reduces uric acid levels in blood. Administration of rasburicase requires caution regarding the following three points: 1) rasburicase is an enzyme preparation and may thus trigger hypersensitivity reactions; 2) antibody formation has been reported, thereby rendering repeated administration is not recommended; 3) rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Although plasmapheresis has been observed to inhibit the progression of TMA-induced renal impairment in a handful of isolated cases, the efficacy of plasmapheresis for this purpose has not been properly assessed and therefore is currently not recommended.</p><p id="Par292">Summary</p><p id="Par293">Plasmapheresis is currently not recommended for anticancer drug-induced TMA due to the dearth of reliable evidence on its efficacy for this purpose. Although there are several case series and cross-sectional studies regarding mitomycin C, these studies have been no assessments of therapy with plasmapheresis alone. Because, plasmapheresis is often performed following hemodialysis or is combined with drug therapy based on anti-platelet drugs and steroids. On the other hand, regarding TMA-induced renal impairment, several reports have only stated that plasmapheresis inhibited further worsening of renal function. In addition, plasmapheresis is often combined with hemodialysis. Thus, the usefulness of plasmapheresis against drug-induced TMA has not truly been assessed.</p><p id="Par294">Background and Objectives</p><p id="Par295">Thrombotic microangiopathy is a disorder that presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and organ dysfunction. Classical TMAs include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga toxin-induced hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), in both of which activity of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) is reduced. However, there is a great deal that remains unknown regarding the pathology of TMA, while the pathology of TMA is diverse; therefore, in 2013, all TMAs other than TTP and HUS were defined as atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), for which diagnostic criteria were created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>]. While TTP can present with both congenital and acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency, most cases involve acquired deficiency, in which anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies are involved. Therefore, plasmapheresis is the first-line treatment for acquired TTP. The objectives of plasmapheresis are ADAMTS13 replenishment; removal of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies; and removal of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (UL-vWFM), which are multimers composed of a hemostatic factor called von Willebrand factor. For HUS, plasmapheresis has not been established as effective and is used primarily as supportive therapy. Plasmapheresis is also used for aHUS induced by complement system abnormalities; however, due to the diverse etiology of aHUS, the efficacy of plasmapheresis for this purpose has not been established. Drug-induced TMA includes TTP caused by production of immunological autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 associated with ticlopidine and other antiplatelet drugs; for this form of TTP, plasmapheresis is effective. On the other hand, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus are not associated with ADAMTS13 deficiency; these drugs considered to cause aHUS, which primarily induces vascular endothelial injury without decreasing ADAMTS13 activity, for which plasmapheresis is often ineffective. Many cases of drug-induced TMA are considered to present with a pathology resembling that of aHUS; however, the detail mechanism of drug-induced TMA remains poorly understood. Anticancer drugs that induce TMA include mitomycin C, cisplatin, bleomycin, gemcitabine, pentostatin, and sunitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>].</p><p id="Par296">Although plasmapheresis is combined with antiplatelet drugs and steroids to treat TMA, there is no established treatment.

Another patient continued to demonstrate decreased renal function following plasmapheresis; however, over the following &#8805; 4 months, renal function gradually improved. The last patient, despite demonstrating an increase in platelet count following plasmapheresis, did not show improvement in renal function and subsequently died. No relationship was demonstrated in these patients between overall mitomycin C dose and TMA onset; thus, no definitive conclusion was reached about the usefulness of plasmapheresis. In some cases, plasmapheresis is combined with antiplatelet drugs (e.g., dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone) or hemodialysis (conditions unknown); therefore, the effects of plasmapheresis monotherapy are difficult to assess.</p><p id="Par299">In regard to cancer-associated HUS, a cross-sectional study of patients in a national registry with hematocrit &#8804; 25%, platelet count &lt; 10 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> &#956;L, and serum Cr &#8805; 1.6 mg/dL (accounting for 99% of patients receiving mitomycin C and 68% of patients receiving 5-FU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>] found that of the 37 patients who underwent plasmapheresis, 11 patients (30%) responded to treatment, while 26 patients (70%) either did not respond to treatment or worsened.
