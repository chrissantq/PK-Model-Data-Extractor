Adherence to anti-seizure medications (ASMs) is a key to treatment success. Poor adherence has been considered as one of the main causes of unsuccessful treatment for epilepsy and presents a potential ongoing challenge for achieving a key therapeutic goal of seizure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among children with epilepsy attending the Pediatrics neurology follow up clinic of Jimma Medical Center from June- 21 to September- 20, 2021. Data were collected by using a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. Epidata version 3.1 and SPSS version 26.0 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis were employed. Adjusted odds ratios were used to ascertain effect sizes for any association between the dependent and associated variables while significance level at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value of &lt;&#8201;0.05 was determined using 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p id="Par3">A total of 170 children with epilepsy were included in this study. About 54.7% were male and 44.7% were in age range of 10&#8211;17&#8201;years. The overall adherence to anti-seizure medications was 54.1%. Those caregivers who were married [AOR&#8201;=&#8201;7.46 (95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;1.46, 38.20)], those children with controlled seizure status [AOR&#8201;=&#8201;3.64 (95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;1.51, 8.78)], those who got appropriate health care [AOR&#8201;=&#8201;7.08(95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;2.91, 17.24)], those caregivers who had good knowledge [AOR&#8201;=&#8201;5.20(95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;2.60,14.83)]; and positive attitude [AOR&#8201;=&#8201;2.57 (95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;1.06, 6.28)] towards epilepsy were significantly associated with adherence to anti-seizure medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">More than half of the children/adolescents having epilepsy were adherent to their anti-seizure medication(s). Children&#8217;s adherence to anti- seizure medications was influenced by current marital status of the parents/caregivers, controlled seizure status, getting appropriate healthcare in the hospital, caregiver&#8217;s knowledge; and attitude towards epilepsy. More efforts are required to scale up the provision of client-centered service (provision of appropriate health care delivery, focus on quality of treatment and providing health education/counseling to improve caregivers&#8217; knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy) to improve children&#8217;s adherence status to their medication(s) and seizure control status.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Attitude</kwd><kwd>Anti-seizure medications</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd><kwd>Jimma medical center</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Seizure control</kwd><kwd>South West Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par18">Over 50 million people are affected by epilepsy worldwide of which 80% are in developing countries. Mortality is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of the general population. The common causes of epilepsy-related deaths are sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (2&#8211;18%) of all deaths in epilepsy, death due to status epilepticus (SE) (12.5%) and suicide (0&#8211;2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 1 out of 150 children is diagnosed with epilepsy during the first 10&#8201;years of life, with the highest incidence rate observed during infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">A systematic analysis of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa showed that, active epilepsy was estimated to affect 4.4 million people in this region. The prevalence of active epilepsy per age group in the same region is 5.09/1000 and 5.98/1000 among children age 0&#8211;9&#8201;years old and 10&#8211;19&#8201;years old respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Epilepsy symptoms can be successfully treated with one or more anti- seizure medications which can control seizures in 60&#8211;80% of patients with new onset epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The goal of treatment of epilepsy includes minimizing the risk of recurrent seizures and anti- seizure medications (ASMs) side effects, and maintaining normal psycho-social and educational/vocational adjustments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Adherence to ASMs is key to treatment success, one of the main causes of unsuccessful drug treatment for epilepsy is poor adherence to prescribed medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Medication adherence increase if the patients and families are involved in treatment choice as well as a mutual agreement between the clients and healthcare providers. Adherence to anti-seizure medications results in decrement of relapses, minimized frequency of seizures, decreased cost of health care, increased therapeutic benefits and better patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Despite the fact that there are significant treatment advances in pediatrics, improvements in medical technology to assess adherence behaviors and increased focus on adherence in research and clinical practice, non-adherence rates across all pediatric chronic illnesses is quite high, 50&#8211;75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to WHO&#8217;s adherence to long-term therapies, adherence to anti- seizure medications in children with epilepsy ranges from 25 to 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specifically; the prevalence rate of adherence to ASMs was 55% in South Africa in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], 55.2% in Nigeria in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], 79.5% in Uganda in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], 61.7% in Saudi Arabia in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 29% in Indian subcontinent in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], 21.3% in western China in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; and 42% in USA in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A study done in Pakistan (2018) on 120 children with epilepsy on ASMs for at least 1 month showed that 70(58%) of children had suboptimal ASM adherence and 50(42%) of them had satisfactory adherence according to self or parental report. In this study, ASM prescription patterns, adverse effects, availability of ASMs, seizure control, treating physician&#8217;s counseling, financial constraints; and parental/caregiver&#8217;s education were more significantly associated with drug non-adherence in these communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Another study done in Turkey in 2020 on 226 children and adolescents with epilepsy and their primary caregivers, the overall prevalence of complete drug adherence among the patients was 47.3%. The main reasons of non-adherence to ASMs were forgetting to take medication (33.6%) and the difficulties in adhering to treatment (24.3%). In contrast to above studies, age and caregivers&#8217; health literacy knowledge were found to be significantly associated with adherence in this study. Patients in the 0 to 5&#8201;years age group were more likely to have full drug adherence than were those in the 12 to 18&#8201;years age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">On the other hand, a study done on 112 children aged 2-14&#8201;year at Queen Rania AL-Abdullah Children Hospital in 2015 showed that 79.5% of the patients display some adherence to anti-seizure medication, while 20.5% of the patients do not display adherence to their anti- seizure medication. 23 patients (20.5%) have low adherence, 56 patients (50%) have medium adherence, and 33 patients (29.4%) have high adherence. In this study, parents&#8217; forgetfulness to give medications to their children (52.2%), fear of medication side effects (33.5%), and being improved and seizure free for a period (30.4%) were significantly associated with non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Seizure control status may affect patients&#8217; adherence to ASMs as it will increase treatment satisfaction; a cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 253 patients with epilepsy in Bangladesh indicate that adherence was 38.7% and associated with well seizure control. Among ASM adherent patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;98), 70(82.4%) had controlled seizure status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Treatment of epilepsy and measurement of adherence to ASM in children has been a major challenge because of the chronicity of the disease and the dependency of children on their parents/caregivers. Further, low adherence and poor seizure control will adversely affect socio-behavioral and cognitive function of children which lead to poor school performance. The factors that affect adherence to ASMs reported by various studies are not similar and there is a lack of information regarding the prevalence and associated factors of adherence to ASMs in the study area and Ethiopia in general. In addition, previous few studies done in Ethiopia focused on adult patients at the community level and focus of health policy of Ministry of health-Ethiopia was on prevention, even though more recently chronic illness including epilepsy gained more attention. Different socio-demographic, clinical and treatment, health services, parental knowledge and attitude, and psychosocial related factors may contribute to non-adherence to ASMs. Therefore, taking into account the existing problem under study, which is a critical and major public health problem and having limited information because of lack of published study on the issue of adherence to ASMs in the study area farther strengthen the importance of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and period</title><p id="Par28">This study was conducted from June 21- Sep 20, 2021, in Jimma Medical Centre (JMC), Jimma, South West Ethiopia. The center is one of the oldest public hospitals in the country located in Jimma town of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. JMC gives services for an estimated 20 million people from Jimma zone and is a referral centre for regions of South Western part of Ethiopia.

to anti-seizure medications is a key to treatment success, one of the main causes of unsuccessful drug treatment is poor adherence to prescribed medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adherence to anti-seizure medications results in decrement of relapses, minimized frequency of seizures, decreased cost of healthcare, increased therapeutic benefits and better patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of ASM adherence and associated factors among children/adolescents having epilepsy on follow- up in JMC.</p><p id="Par52">The adherence status to ASMs in this study was 54.1% and the rest(45.9%) of the study participants were non-adherent to ASMs. The prevalence of adherence to ASMs in children having epilepsy is similar to the study done in South Africa(55%) in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Joe, Nigeria(55.2%) in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Turkey (47.3%) in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this might be because of similar socio-demographic status of the study population participated and use of similar scales (MMAS-8) (in Nigerian &amp; Turkish study) to assess adherence in these studies.</p><p id="Par53">However, the prevalence of adherence to ASMs in our study was significantly lower than the study done in 94 children in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia(61.7%) in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The possible justification for the disparities between these studies might be due to different demographic status including socio-economic status and higher literacy ratio, lower study population(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;94) and use of earlier scale (MMAS-4) to assess adherence in this study; and also lower than the study done in Uganda(79.5%) in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], this difference might be because of higher literacy ratio and use of different scales to assess adherence to ASM (self report- focus group discussion).</p><p id="Par54">The prevalence of adherence to ASMs in this study was higher than that of studies done in Pakistan(42%) in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], USA(42%) in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Bangladesh (38.8%) in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Indian subcontinent(29%) in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Western China(27.3%) in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; these differences might be due to long duration of studies (USA and Bangladesh) and use of different adherence measuring scales(e.g. Electronic method to measure adherence in study done in USA) and different definitions of adherence to ASMs(e.g. moderate and low adherence were considered as &#8216;poor adherence&#8217; in study done in Western China and Indian Subcontinent).</p><p id="Par55">There were different factors contributing to the adherence to prescribed anti-seizure medications. The current study identified marital status of the caregivers; i.e. being married caregiver(s)/parent(s) was associated with the adherence. This might be due to stable and full family support (similar with the study done in KSA, 2015). Others associated with adherence to ASMs include children/adolescents whose seizure was controlled might be due to treatment satisfaction and frequency of seizure will increase in those who were non- adherent to thier medications (in study done in KSA, 2015). Parents/caregivers who recieved appropriate health care in the hospital during follow- up visit were more than 6 times adherent to their ASMs; this was due to smooth and friendly communication with hospital staff (which was similar with the study done in KSA, 2015) and also might be due to recieving of appropriate health/drug information from medical staff (similar with the study done in W. China, 2020); those parents/caregivers whose knowledge about epilepsy was good (about 6 times) and positive attitude (about 3 times) towards epilepsy were more adherent to ASMs (increased awareness about epilepsy &amp; ASMs might contribute, supported by study done in Turkey, 2020).</p><p id="Par56">In a study done in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], long duration of therapy and medications (Oxcarbamazepine, Valproic acid and Phenytoin) were significantly associated with adherence to ASMs; the age of the patients, type of epilepsy, total household income and source of drug information in Western China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; monotherapy, good family support &amp; lower frequency of seizures (similar to our study) in KSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were significantly associated with adherence to ASMs.</p><p id="Par57">Unlike our study, higher family socioeconomic status was significantly associated with ASM adherence in a study done in USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; low socioeconomic status, multiple drug intake &amp; long duration of therapy were significantly associated with ASM non-adherence in Joe, Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Seizure control status is a key to adherence to ASMs which helps patients stick to their medications. In this study, seizure control status was significantly associated with adherence. Our finding was similar to the study done in Indian Subcontinent (seizure control&#8201;=&#8201;51.78%) in which one or more seizure episodes in the past 3&#8201;months (un-controlled seizure) adversely affected ASM adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and higher than the study done in Bangladesh (33.6% seizure control status) which was significantly associated with adherence to ASMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In contrast to our study, age of the child (0&#8211;5&#8201;years, because drugs are given by the patients/caregivers, while adolescents usually manage their own treatment) was significantly associated with ASM adherence in a study done in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Being on multiple medications can lead to non-adherence in many ways; including increased medication cost, pill burden and more adverse drug reactions. Pill burden is particularly a problem in children and adolescents and refusal to take drugs is worse with increasing number of medications. Poly-therapy is more likely to be associated with drug toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Nearly two third (108, 63.5%) of our study participants were on mono-therapy (similar to study done in Nigeria, 59.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], from this &#8216;Phenytoin only&#8217; accounted for nearly half (82, 48.2%) of cases; from those (those on mono-therapy) more than half of them were adherent to their medication(s) but mode of therapy was not associated with adherence status to ASMs in this study.</p><p id="Par60">Parents&#8217;/caregivers&#8217; knowledge about epilepsy was similar to the study done in Ethiopia (North Shoa, 2018) (56.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; similar cultural, economic, and sociodemographic features might contribute. Our finding was significantly associated with adherence to ASMs; similar with the study done in Turkey (caregivers&#8217; health literacy knowledge was significantly associated with ASMs adherence,) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; and our finding was significantly higher in comparison to the study done in India (10/60, 16.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], this difference might be due to small sample size(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;60).</p><p id="Par61">Parents&#8217;/caregivers&#8217; positive attitude towards epilepsy was significantly associated with adherence status to ASMs which was comparable with the study done in India (55%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and it was comparable with the study done in Ethiopia (North Shoa, 2018)(58.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par62">Hence the actual prevalence of adherence to ASM(s) may be even lower because we used parent/caregiver and/or adolescent-report to assess adherence status which may be subjected to recall bias as some may feel pressured to give acceptance responses to gain positive reaction from data collectors/health care workers.</p><p id="Par63">The research was done in single institution which may not help to generalize the findings of this study for regional or country level and samples were taken from hospital which might not be representative as many patients may not come to hospital despite their illness for different reasons.</p><p id="Par64">Further, many patients were not had EEG for the diagnosis of epilepsy; thus diagnosis of epilepsy and initiation of ASMs was based on clinical evidences.</p><p id="Par65">Lastly, sample size was drawn based on study done in Nigeria which is far from our study area (Ethiopia).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">More than half of the children/adolescents having epilepsy were adherent to their anti-seizure medication(s).
