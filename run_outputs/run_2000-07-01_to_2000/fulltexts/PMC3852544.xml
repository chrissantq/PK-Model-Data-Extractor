For biofuels, an attractive trait among the grasses has been C4 photosynthesis, which is particular to specific clades of the Gramineae, most prominently the Panicoideae. Traits of interest include increased CO<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency, water use efficiency and drought tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite the many beneficial traits of C4-grasses, the conversion of cellulosic carbohydrate to liquid transportation biofuel is limited by the recalcitrant influence upon enzymatic hydrolysis of one the most abundant component of the plant cell wall, lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Lignin, a complex heterologous polymer derived primarily from three hydroxycinnamil alcohol monomers with different extents of methoxylation, namely, p-coumaryl-, coniferyl- and sinapyl-alcohols, is synthesised through the phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Many advances have occurred in elucidating the genes and the genetic modules involved in this complex pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Regulatory mechanisms are often mediated through metabolic intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggesting a dynamic balancing act within the phenylpropanoid pathway that could be open to re-wiring.</p><p>A class of low lignin mutants that were discovered in maize (first identified in 1924 in Minnesota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) were the brown midrib mutants (<italic toggle="yes">bm</italic>). The <italic toggle="yes">bm</italic> mutants were named based on the red &#8211; brown coloration of the lamina midrib, which intriguingly accompanied low levels of lignification in stem tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. General screening of chemical mutagenesis populations subsequently expanded the number of allelic and non-allelic <italic toggle="yes">brown midrib</italic> lines in maize and sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For instance, allelism studies established that many of the sorghum <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> mutants arose from deleterious mutations in caffeic acid O-methyl transferase (<italic toggle="yes">COMT</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], although evidence of sorghum <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> arising from cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (<italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic>) were also discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Notably, with exception of the brown midrib phenotype, the <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> mutants display little alteration in gross morphogenesis compared with WT, but as a feedstock have lower lignin content and thus greater cellulose digestibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, double <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> mutants have been shown to display delayed development and infertility, indicating a limitation on the extent to which lignin biosynthesis can be suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, a clear relationship between lignin biosynthesis and saccharification efficiency has been highlighted using the <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> mutants. It remains unclear whether along with the <italic toggle="yes">bmr</italic> phenotype, other phenotypic markers exist for altered phenylpropanoid metabolism and digestibility.</p><p>Della is a sweet sorghum [<italic toggle="yes">Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench](Reg. no.CV-130, PI566819) developed in the 1980&#8217;s by R.L Harrison (Virginia Tech University) for the Sorghum syrup production. The cultivar was derived from a cross between the Dale and ATx622&#8242;. The diploid Della variety was selected from this cross by the pedigree breeding methodology for six generations and determined to be pure breeding in 1990. The main advantage over Dale, is that Della flowers a week earlier, maintains excellent drought tolerance and disease resistance to anthracnose pathogens. Here, the dominant <italic toggle="yes">REDforGREEN</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>) mutant was generated through chemical mutagenesis (ethyl methanesulfonate EMS) in the Della variety. The <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant was identified through a phenotypic screen for enhanced red pigmentation in plant tissues. It is demonstrated that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant displays an antithetic abundance/reduction of lignin in a tissue specific manner. We report the investigation of physical and chemical properties of the cell wall in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and determine the suitability of <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> for bioconversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic toggle="yes">REDforGREEN (RG)</italic> sorghum mutant: trait inheritance evaluation</title><p>In sweet sorghum Della [<italic toggle="yes">Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench](Reg. no.CV-130, PI566819), the phenotype of highly pigmented leaves and low lignin stem arose from the M<sub>1</sub> and segregated in subsequent M<sub>2</sub> generation in a dominant manner. We found that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype displayed dominant inheritance and was carried through subsequent generations. Backcrossing into parental Della over two backcrossed generations was achieved. From the segregating F<sub>2</sub> populations we recovered 761 plants 567 were phenotypically <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> whereas 194 were phenotypically wild type in a ratio near to 3:1 (&#967;<sup>2</sup> = 0.04892 df = 1, P &gt; 0.05), illustrating dominant inheritance, consistent with a single mutant gene. The <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype was found to be indistinguishable from the homozygote, therefore fully penetrant in the heterozygous state. Further, when the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> heterozygote was backcrossed into a wild type Della plant we obtained a near 1:1 (<italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>-phenotype to wild type-phenotype) ratio consistent with a single dominant gene segregating in a mendelian manner. The wild type, heterozygous and homozygous segregants were further analyzed in the selfed F<sub>3</sub> generations to ensure segregation and selection of homozygotes for second round backcrossing. In wild type, no reoccurrence of the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype was observed, consistent with dominant inheritance of the trait.</p></sec><sec><title><italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant displays hyper-accumulation of pigments and reduced plant height</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant was phenotypically identified by a marked accumulation of red/purple pigments in the leaf blades (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). This trait was characterized as leaf-specific and it evolved in a basipetal manner, from the tip of the leaf to the base and further to the leaf sheath (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The initial evaluation was completed in a temperature-controlled glasshouse and all leaves, in a progressive manner, manifested the phenotype thus resulting in a notable red/purple plant (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To explore the mature <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> plant phenotype outside the greenhouse, a field performance trial was established over two growing seasons. <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> displayed a reduction in maximum height, compared with wild type. Results showed an average decrement of 37% (P &lt; 0.0001, Mann&#8211;Whitney) during the first year and 40% (P &lt; 0.0001, Mann&#8211;Whitney) for the second year (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, C, D). Reduction in height could arise in association with three phenotypes: 1) reduced internodal length, 2) fewer nodes initiated during the life cycle or 3) both fewer internodes of a shorter length. A large internodal length decrease was calculated for the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant as compared to the wild type (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and E, P &lt; 0.0001). Notably, the number of nodes was significantly greater in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> versus wild type (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, E; P &lt; 0.0001) but this could not compensate for the shorter internode length for <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>, resulting in shorter plants. Additionally, the frequency distributions of internode lengths between the two genotypes indicated that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant is skewed toward shorter internodes relative to a more normal distribution of overall longer lengths in WT (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and C). Leaf length and width was also estimated but was not significantly different (Data not shown). Further, it was found that the average seed weight (1000 seeds weight, with replication) was not different between <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and the wild type (<italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>, 1.80&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.04; WT, 1.85&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.03), which was consistent with no visible change in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> inflorescence. Moreover, no changes in the nature and the extent of bran pigmentation, brown for Della variety, were observed.</p><fig id="F1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic toggle="yes">RG </italic></bold><bold>phenotype and plant height determination.

The red/purple accumulation in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves was consistent with an alteration in the phenylpropanoid pathway. This pathway is also responsible for the production of lignin therefore we anticipated that the genes responsible for the production of pigments and for lignin could be altered as well. To test this hypothesis, gene expression-and chemical compositional-analyses were performed. An increase in transcript abundance was observed for key genes involved in the lignin biosynthetic branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> red leaves compared with wild type (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The converse was true for gene expression in the stems for all but cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Consistent with these data, transcript abundance extended from those genes whose products are responsible for the earliest committed metabolic conversions in the phenylpropoanoid pathway (Petti et al., cosubmitted). To establish whether lignin biosynthesis was increased, we visually observed lignin by counterstaining with phloroglucinol stain (Maule&#8217;s reagent, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Here, we examined transverse cross sections of <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type stems and leaves. Results illustrated a more pronounced lignin staining in the wild type stem section relative to <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A,C) and <italic toggle="yes">vice versa</italic> in the leaf (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B,D). Therefore, histochemical data suggest that stems of the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant have reduced lignin biosynthesis whereas the leaves display increased levels. Transcriptional characterization of 4-week old <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and WT stems demonstrated a down-regulation for key genes involved in the lignin pathway for <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> compared to the wild type, corroborating the histochemical evidence for lignin reduction (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B).

It was anticipated that increased lignification in the leaves would influence saccharification efficiency. Indeed, it was found that WT leaves were more efficiently converted to fermentable sugars than <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).

Moreover phenolic lignin components, such as ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, are covalently bound to hemicelluloses. Therefore, we hypothesized that further rearrangements in the plant cell wall may exist in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> plants. To further explore, we analysed cellulose and neutral sugar composition in the leaves and stems of both genotypes. No significant difference in the percentage of cellulose was determined between the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type in either tissue type (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, P &gt; 0.05). Further, when we examined the distribution and localization of crystalline cellulose by calcofluor white staining in stems of the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type, we observed similar fluorescence intensity in transverse sections (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Neutral sugars, which contribute to the hemicellulosic fraction of the cell wall displayed variation between the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant and wild type. Fucose and rhamnose, which in general account for small portions of the total sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], were unchanged in the stems. In leaves, rhamnose was significantly greater in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C).

By contrast, leaf xylose decreased in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> from 26% in wild type to 19%. The stem composition also displayed differences. Here, galactose was decreased significantly and glucose was increased in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D, P &lt; 0.05).

Pyrolysates originating from the lignin fraction within the biomass include phenol, guaiacol, syringol and related aromatic hydrocarbons. The relative abundance of the lignin-based pyrolysates compared to holocellulose-based pyrolysates is influenced by the relative abundance of each of these polymers within the biomass. Py-GC/MS analysis of <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type sorghum leaves and stems generate pyrograms for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S2, while pyrograms are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S3 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S4). As expected, the total area percentage of pyrolysates originating from the lignin fraction of wild type biomass was higher in the stems than in the leaves. The wild type stems also produced more pyrolysates originating from the sinapyl monomer within the lignin polymer. Hence, the S:G ratio of the stems was higher than that of the leaves. Additionally, pyrolysis of the stems produced larger amounts of 4-vinylphenol; this is most likely the result of higher coumaryl-lignin content within the stems. The pyrograms show how the relative heights and areas of the peaks from the holocellulose (retention time typically &lt; 24&#160;min) are lower than those from the lignin (retention time &gt;24&#160;min) for the stem materials in comparison with the leaves. Compared to wild type, Py-GC/MS analysis of <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves and stems (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S4) demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves produce a higher total amount of lignin-based volatile pyrolysates than the wild type leaves, which was consistent with lignin content determination. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>-leaves produced more sinapyl-derived pyrolysates relative to coniferyl-derived pyrolysates than the wild type leaves and hence appear to have a higher S:G ratio based on the distribution of the volatile pyrolysates. In addition, the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stems have slightly higher S:G ratios than the wild type stems and show a higher distribution of lignin-based pyrolysates in comparison to the wild-type stems. While this analysis contradicts the total lignin content determination, it may reflect the differences between the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type stems in the preferential formation of char from certain biopolymers. For example, the char production upon pyrolysis of the sorghum samples may differ and may incorporate varying degrees of char and nonvolatile compounds from the lignin or holocellulosic fractions. Hence, Py-GC/MS analysis may not always agree with lignin content determination. It does, however, provide information regarding the production of certain renewable bio-chemicals produced by thermal decomposition. For example, the mutant stems produced significantly higher amounts of phenol and 4-vinylphenol (P &lt; 0.05) than the wild type stems. These pyrolysates are likely the result of increased coumaryl content within the lignin in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stems. The <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves also produced more vanillin upon pyrolysis. Taken together these data indicate that the composition and structure of the lignin polymers differed between <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type, and are partly consistent with quantitative lignin determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermochemical analysis of <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic></title><p>Of interest was how the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves and stems, which displayed marked changes in cell wall composition, undergo thermal decomposition in comparison with wild type. On the basis of TG curves, it is evident that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem pyrolyzed at a higher temperature in comparison with the wild type feedstock (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). Furthermore, it was found that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem displayed approximately 10% less weight loss at 450&#176;C relative to the wild type stem (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). Neither stem nor leaf samples showed greater than 80% weight loss, which might reflect repolymerization of lignin residue forming &#8220;hard coke&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and it reflects the ash content present in the biomass. DTG analysis of leaves showed that <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> biomass underwent decomposition at a higher temperature (about 365&#176;C) compared to wild type leaves (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C) and also demonstrated a prominent shift in the main decomposition peak from 355 to 365&#176;C. It has been reported that hemicellulose and cellulose show DTG peaks at 268&#176;C and 355&#176;C, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Wild type leaf tissue showed a single decomposition peak at 355&#176;C, which was consistent with a strong cellulose peak. <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf decomposition took place at two different temperatures (290&#8211;300&#176;C, 365&#8211;375&#176;C) corresponding to two distinct DTG peaks (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). This result suggests that modifying cell wall composition in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant modestly increased the pyrolysis temperature of the leaf sample. In stem analyses, the DTG curves revealed a pronounced peak at 355&#176;C for both mutant and wild type (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D). The wild type stem also displayed a nominal pyrolysis peak at 210&#176;C that was absent in all remaining samples and was uncharacterized. Taken together, the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves pyrolyzed over a broader temperature regimen than the stems. It is likely that a masked broad peak of low weight loss rate occurring in all of the DTG plots from approximately 200&#176;C to 600&#176;C corresponds to the decomposition of the lignin in the biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The lignin in each of the samples (leaves and stems) appears to decompose at similar rates despite differences in the DTG plots (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C, D).</p><fig id="F7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Thermogravimetric analysis.</bold> Weight-loss curves for leaf <bold>(A)</bold> and stem <bold>(B)</bold>.

Interestingly, it was found that the wild type leaf tissue exhibited greater metal abundance than observed in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>. The opposite trend was observed in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stems, where total metal composition was 27015&#160;ppm compared to the WT stem total of 14437&#160;ppm, almost 50% fewer metals in the WT stem (Table&#160;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Out of 11 metals examined, four were essential micronutrients (B, Mn, Zn and Fe; Table&#160;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and three of those, B, Mn and Zn, had between 1.5 to 3-fold greater abundance in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf than in the wild type.

displayed antithetic leaf shoot lignification, which results in improved saccharification efficiency in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf samples displayed approximately 30% lower efficiency and <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem was approximately 2.5-fold higher saccharification efficiency than wild type. These results correlated with an irregular distribution of insoluble lignin in the abovementioned tissues and support lignin&#8217;s inhibitory role on enzymatic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Indeed, lignin was more abundant in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves and less abundant in stems, when compared with wild type. Thus, the sorghum <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype identified here represents a prominent marker for redistribution of lignin (and broadly phenylpropanoid metabolism) and improved stem saccharification efficiency for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars.</p><p>Despite evidence that lignin content and composition were altered, as was the hemicellulose fraction, no data supported a change in cellulose biosynthesis in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant. The proportion of cellulose as expressed per gram of cell wall was unchanged between the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type. Further, XRD as well as pseudo-kinetics of semi-purified cellulose saccharification failed to support a structural alteration of the cellulose microfibrils. Therefore, it seems most plausible that the alterations in saccharification arose as a consequence of the abundance and composition of lignin in the cell wall. Ancillary phenolic components such as flavonoids were also more abundant in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant (unpublished data). It is therefore foreseeable that lignin, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds collectively contributed to lower saccharification efficiency, consistent with prior reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nonetheless, prior evidence supports lignin content having the most pronounced effect on saccharification efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype included an overaccumulation of phenolic constituents, including lignin in leaf material. The leaf tissue of the plant is less suitable for saccharification, but has several interesting properties for exploitation in a bio-based economy. Specifically, thermochemical pyrolysis coupled to GC/MS demonstrated that the increased lignin and phenolic components of the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf tissue released a differential spectrum of high value pyrolysates including vanillin, a structural compound related to vanillin, namely the 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyacetophenone (Apocynin) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde; these compounds have been investigated for their pharmaceutical potentials and effect on human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The molecular makeup of pyrolysate (bio-oil) depends partially on the composition of the feedstock. In the case of the high lignin leaf material in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant, oxygenates resulting from the oxidative deconstruction of lignin could be deoxygenated to produce hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or separated to recover high-value chemicals that are present, for example upgradable building blocks such as phenols. Tailoring biomass composition as was performed herein needs to be accompanied by deconstruction chemical engineering processes to improve the range of fuels and chemicals derived. In this context, with around 13% of crude fossil oil used for the production of chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] that are important for everyday life, the identification of biomass feedstocks with the appropriate composition to replace these products needs further consideration.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves produced greater sinapyl-derived pyrolysates relative to coniferyl-derived pyrolysates than did WT leaves and hence appear to have a higher S:G ratio. Changes in S:G ratio can influence degradation properties, in terms of hydrolytic enzymes creating fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic feedstocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, the metabolic re-writing evident in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> may represent a strategy to modulate lignin structure. Lignin and other phenolic plant metabolites have typically been viewed as a waste stream in a biorefineries, which instead focus on polysaccharides as feedstock inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the case of the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant, the leaf biomass would need to be removed and separated from stem material either during or post-harvest in order to optimize biorefining costs. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf tissues also displayed increased micronutrients. Coupled with increased phenolics such as anthocyanins, the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf tissue may provide a feedstock for the development of nutritional supplements for livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Indeed, high value by-products of lignocellulosic crops developed during bioprocessing has been under-explored.</p><p>The main <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype related to bioenergy was antithetic lignification of leaves versus stems. Reduction in stem lignification has remained a goal of biotechnology efforts to reduce the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass to saccharification. However, the possible genetic mechanism for control of such a shift in the PPP are not clear. In <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaves<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> lignin, anthocyanin and 3-deoxyantho-cyanidins were all upregulated. This is consistent with the entire PPP being co-regulated, not just a sub-branch of the pathway. Regulation of the PPP is complex, and numerous levels of feedback inhibition and transcriptional regulation exist. For example, intermediates of the pathway negatively regulate gene expression and thus co-regulate the accumulation of precursor or the next metabolite ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and as discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). In the stems of <italic toggle="yes">RG,</italic> down-regulation of the lignin specific PPP genes was generally observed. One exception was observed for the <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic> transcript<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> whose expression was up regulated, contradictory to reduced lignification of the young stem tissue. The <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic> gene encodes a cynnamyl alchohol dehydrogenase. In most higher plants, coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes are converted to alcohols by the CAD enzyme, but also by sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD) for the respective aldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Despite lignin formation resulting from a complex network of interacting genes, we anticipated that CAD would not be upregulated. It remains unclear why this reversal of gene expression to end-product metabolite occurs, but we speculate that the timing of <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic> expression may have either be invoked as a compensatory mechanism to general down-regulation of the pathway. While possible, it is unlikely that an alternative aldehyde substrate or concentration of coniferyl aldehyde increased. Finally, it may be possible that epigenetic modifier influenced PPP elements differentially, as was recently observed for the dominant <italic toggle="yes">Unstable factor for orange1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Ufo1</italic>) allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Regardless, this differential expression of <italic toggle="yes">CAD</italic> remains an obvious irregularity in our dataset. The genetic mechanism underscoring <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> must therefore over-ride genetic, developmental and physiological regulatory networks underlying the PPP. It is thus not surprising that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> displayed some similarity to previously described phenotypes associated with PPP regulation, notably the light dependence of the <italic toggle="yes">Lc, B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> loci<italic toggle="yes">. RG</italic> also shared similarity with the carbohydrate defective mutants, <italic toggle="yes">SXD</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TYE</italic>, whereby inability to mobilize sucrose led to a starch accumulation and early pigmentation and leaf senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It is possible that the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> phenotype arises as a result of a block in sucrose remobilization from leaves to major physiological sinks (stem in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic>). Such as scenario is consistent with reduced biomass and lignin in stems, sucrose remaining in leaves being deposited as lignin as alternative carbon sink and anthocyanin accumulation due to osmotic stress/phloem swelling. Similarities to the phenotypes such as single gene dominant inheritance and morphogenic phenotypes are evident between <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and the maize alleles that condition premature senescence in the absence of kernel formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Lignin alteration in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> was also qualitative. A change in the S:G ratio was measured in <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> compared with wild type. Since deposition of lignin types (H, G and S) is a spatial-temporal process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], the quantitative/qualitative changes could indicate that the branches of the lignin pathways are differentially regulated leading to a differential deposition of say S versus G. It is tempting to speculate that bypassing the regulatory networks responsible for physiological and developmental control may be associated with a dominant negative mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Similarly, a mutation in the promoter region of transcription factors has been associated with the activation of the PPP. For instance, multiple repeats within a MYB10 transcription factor in apples (<italic toggle="yes">Malus domestica</italic> L.) have been coupled with an autoregulation and a dramatic all-red phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. However, evidences of single gene autoregulation are also available in literature for instance the case for the sorghum <italic toggle="yes">bmr2</italic> mutant and a consistent down-regulation of lignin in both tissue types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant leaf biomass has potential to be implemented as a dual use crop, particularly as the EMS mutation was generated in the <italic toggle="yes">S. bicolor</italic> DELLA sweet sorghum background, noted by the abundant sucrose sequestered in the stem during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. However, the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant displayed an overall reduction in the total plant height in the mature plant to around 60-70% of wild type. Several plausible explanations exist to explain this observation. Firstly, the reduction in size was consistent with the correlation between lignin content and biomass highlighted in various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Here, reduced lignin results in reduced water transport capacity and suppressed height potential. Nonetheless, in a techno-economic assessment the reduced height (biomass) may result in a loss of economic profitability for using <italic toggle="yes">RG,</italic> despite the improved saccharification efficiency. Depending on the yield of high-value bio-chemicals derived from any feedstock, the biomass processing value chain becomes unsustainable. Therefore, provided the increased phenolic structures in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> leaf tissue combined with the accessible carbohydrate reserves evident low lignin sweet Sorghum stems providing an intriguing feedstock for assessment.</p><p>Estimates of the DELLA cultivar yield, linked to the parental cultivar Dale, are 18.6 tons per acre of stripped stalks ready for conversion to sweet sorghum syrup (Blitzer, AGR122). With a 30% reduction in yield around 13 tons per acre would be produced. Given the 2,5-fold increase in saccharification efficiency in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem, the resulting glucose yield for biofuel conversion may compensate for the loss in sucrose yield.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Antithetic lignin accumulation was observed in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant leaf and stem tissue, which resulted in greater saccharification efficiency in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> stem and differential thermochemical product yield in high lignin leaves. Process tailored biomass feedstocks for bio-alcohols, hydrocarbon-based renewable fuels or biobased chemicals represent an underexplored breeding end point. Data for high lignin leaves in the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant demonstrate the potential for creating different pyrolytic breakdown products and yields, which could have important connotations for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Mutant and wild type (WT) seeds were sown on soil-less media (MetroMix 360, SunGro Industries Bellevue, WA). Plants were grown and maintained in a temperature-controlled glasshouse at 24&#176;C. Soil was maintained at field water conditions and fertilized with 3 grams of Osmocoat (The Scotts Company, Marysville, OH) integrated into the soil-less media before seeding. Plants were transplanted into the field and drip irrigated into a maurey silt loam soil-type, at the University of Kentucky Horticulture Research Farm (Emmitt Road, Lexington, KY) and maintained under plasticulture. Following establishment, the plants were grown in full sunlight for 3&#160;months. Leaf and stem color, total plant height, internode length, total node number per plant and leaf blade length (from the ligule to the leaf tip) and width at the widest point were all acquired from these plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Leaf and stem RNA extraction and Q-RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Gene expression of candidate genes within the PPP was done on red leaf as well as to stems of 4-weeks old leafless sorghum <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type plantlets. Three biological replications were harvested for each sorghum line, <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and wild type. RNA extraction was done by a modified hot-phenol protocol described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. DNAsing, carried out by DNAse I (Fermentas), and cDNA synthesis (AB Applied Biosystem) were completed according to the manufacturer indication.

For lignin determination, the first internodal region of field grown plants was used as well as leaf material, and 4 biological replicates (each containing 4 technical replicates) of 300&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.0&#160;mg were employed. The localization of lignin was determined histochemically on stems of axillary secondary shoots of the main mutant/WT, stem as well as on 4&#8211;6&#160;weeks old plantlets, using a saturated solution of phloroglucinol in 20% HCl. All chemicals were reagent grade (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), unless noted otherwise.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural characterization of the mutant biomass by thermal decomposition</title><p>The products formed from thermal decomposition of the total biomass were analyzed via Pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Pyrolysis-GC/MS experiments were performed using a Pyroprobe Model 5200 (CDS Analytical, Inc.) connected to an Agilent 7890 GC with an Agilent 5975C MS detector. The pyroprobe was operated in trap mode under a He atmosphere. Pyrolysis was conducted at 650&#176;C (1000&#176;C&#160;s<sup>-1</sup> heating rate) for 20&#160;s. The valve oven and transfer lines were maintained at 325&#176;C. The column used in the GC was a DB1701 (60&#160;m &#215; 0.25&#160;mm &#215; 0.25&#160;&#956;m) and the temperature program was as follows: 45&#176;C for 3&#160;min., ramp to 280&#176;C at 4&#176;C&#160;min<sup>-1</sup> and hold for 10&#160;min. The flow rate was set to 1&#160;ml&#160;min<sup>-1</sup> using He as the carrier gas. The inlet and auxiliary lines were both maintained at 300&#176;C and the MS source was set at 70&#160;eV. The GC-MS was calibrated for a number of phenolic compounds including phenol, 2-methoxyphenol, 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, vanillin, syringaldehyde and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. Pyrolysis products were analyzed according to retention time and mass spectra data obtained from a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. The ratio among syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) lignin components (S:G ratio) was determined from the distribution of lignin pyrosylates according to a published method (Harman-Ware et al. 2013). TGA was performed on a TA Discovery TGA under 25&#160;ml&#160;min<sup>-1</sup> of N<sub>2</sub> at a ramp of 10&#176;C&#160;min<sup>-1</sup> to 800&#176;C followed by a ramp of 20&#176;C&#160;min<sup>-1</sup> to 1000&#176;C. The chemical alteration and the lignin ratio were determined using a function describing the relative abundance of the determined pyrolysates.</p></sec><sec><title>Neutral sugar analysis</title><p>For neutral sugar analysis, a protocol described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] was followed.

Briefly, total biomass was collected from field grown samples. Samples were dried at 50&#176;C for seven days prior to homogenization using a grinder (Arthur H Thomas Co Scientific, Philadelphia, PA, USA) equipped with a 1.0&#160;mm sieve. A cocktail of Cellulase from <italic toggle="yes">Trichoderma reesei</italic> (Sigma) and Cellobiase from <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus niger</italic> (Sigma, USA), equivalent to 2 Filter Paper Activity Units (FPU), was used to digest 100&#160;mg of raw biomass (ethanol and acetone washed) in a 50&#160;mM citrate buffer (pH&#160;4.8) in a final volume of 2&#160;ml at 50&#176;C. A time course deconstruction assay was performed over a period of 48&#160;hours (at 0, 4, 12, 24 and 48&#160;hours) whereby 3 100&#160;&#956;l aliquots (without replacement) were collected for glucose analysis. Quantification used the Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI)-glucose analyzer standardized for glucose determination using YSI buffer and membranes purchased from YSI (Yellow Springs, OH, USA). Glucose release was converted into saccharification efficiency and expressed as a percentage of cellulose within the biomass convertible to glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>Semi-purified cellulose digestion</title><p>Cellulase digestion and pseudo apparent kinetic analysis of semi-purified cellulose from both the <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> mutant and wild type tissue was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Semi-purified cellulose (2, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20&#160;mg) obtained from leaf and stem material from <italic toggle="yes">RG</italic> and WT was digested in the presence of equal amounts of Cellulase and Cellobiase, equivalent to 2 FPU, in a 50&#160;mM citrate buffer (pH&#160;4.8) in a final volume of 2&#160;ml at 50&#176;C for 2&#160;hours. The enzyme mixture was heat inactivated (100&#176;C, 3&#160;min) prior to glucose measurement using the YSI-glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs, OH, USA)(as described above). These data were generated in triplicate for average&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard error and the glucose values converted to mol min<sup>-1</sup> unit protein<sup>-1</sup> and used to determine the apparent kinetics values using the program GRAPHPAD PRISM-4 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
