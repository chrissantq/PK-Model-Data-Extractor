These risks include an elevated potential for fetotoxicity due to placental drug transport. Nanomedicines offer a promising solution by potentially preventing trans-placental passage. Targeted nanomedicines could enhance safety and efficacy in treating maternal or placental pathophysiology. Our study investigates placental transfer kinetics of targeted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in an ex vivo human placenta cotyledon perfusion model. We collected human placentas for dual-side ex vivo placental perfusions. Targeted LNPs with a fluorescence tag were introduced into the maternal circuit of each placenta. To establish if there was trans-placental passage of LNPs to the fetal circuit, we collected samples from maternal and fetal circuits throughout the six hours of the perfusion. We determined the fluorescence signal using a multi-mode microplate reader and Multiphoton microscopy to localize the LNPs in the placenta tissue. Data from perfused placenta tissue showed no significant transfer of the fluorescently labeled LNPs across the placental barrier to the fetal circuit. Localization of targeted LNPs in tissue samples is mainly observed in the maternal blood space of the placenta. Our results suggest that targeted LNPs present a promising strategic approach to prevent trans-placental passage to the fetus. Our future perspectives involve investigating the efficacy of targeted LNPs as well as loading targeted LNPs with nucleic acid-based therapeutics to investigate their therapeutic potential.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

This includes diseases that arise during pregnancy, such as hypertensive disorders involving placental pathophysiology (including preeclampsia). Approximately 90% of the medications present challenges, as they are mostly used off-label and have not been specifically tested for safety during pregnancy. Medication use during pregnancy may adversely affect the mother and fetus, including the risk of fetotoxicity. This is because most medicines are small molecules (&lt;&#8201;600 Da) that passively transport over the placental barrier to the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Nanoparticles could prevent such passive or facilitated diffusion. Nanoparticles are colloidal systems and defined as particles below one micrometer. When the nanoparticle encapsulates drug molecules, the fate of the drugs no longer depends on its own characteristics. Tailoring the physicochemical characteristics of nanomedicine, such as the composition, size, and surface charge, alters the tissue distribution profile and can steer where encapsulated therapeutics are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Decorating the surface of the nanomedicine with targeting ligands enhances the efficacy of the drug by specifically interacting with desired cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the context of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, targeting is particularly aimed at endothelial or trophoblast cells. Nanomedicine offer exciting potential as a therapeutic strategy during pregnancy by controlling the drug interaction with the placenta and enhancing safety by preventing exposure of drugs to the fetus.</p><p id="Par9"><italic toggle="yes">Lipid nanoparticles</italic> (LNPs) are currently the leading non-viral delivery systems for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including siRNA, mRNA, or plasmid DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These LNPs are utilized for disease treatments by either silencing pathogenic genes or expressing therapeutic proteins. To overcome challenges of nucleic acid-based therapeutics, for instance rapid clearance from circulation and susceptibility to degradation, various strategies such as chemical modifications or encapsulation in nanoparticles are employed. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics hold promise in the obstetric field, as indicated by a study in baboons that showed a positive impact of siRNA delivery by a targeting peptide on the phenotype of preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, nucleic acid-based therapeutics encapsulated in LNPs decorated with VHH nanobody (Variable domain of Heavy chain of Heavy-chain antibody) enhance the specificity of target tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The use of LNPs during pregnancy remains uncharted territory in which especially the optimal and safe design of LNPs to specifically prevent trans-placental passage needs further elucidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">This study aims to determine whether targeted LNPs with VHH nanobody, against specific epitopes found in endothelial and placental tissue, prevent trans-placental passage in an ex vivo human placenta perfusion model. The majority of studies evaluate nucleic acid delivery during pregnancy in an animal model, especially mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although in vivo animal models allow for the evaluation of efficacy, immunogenicity, and toxicity, mice placenta have physiological and anatomical differences compared to human placentas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore the ex vivo human placenta perfusion model offers a high translational value and detailed investigations of the placental passage of medicine or drug delivery systems in the human placenta without considering the ethical concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We use multiphoton microscopy (MPM) as a sophisticated imaging technique to localize the fluorescently labeled targeted LNPs in the placenta tissue without extra staining of the tissue, neither cutting it into thin slices. The outcome of this study would enable us to load nucleic acid-based therapeutics into our targeted LNPs, aiming to enhance maternal and placental health in obstetric diseases such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Moreover, this design could be rapidly adapted for other therapeutic approaches during pregnancy by decorating various VHH nanobodies against different target tissues and thereby applied across a broad spectrum of pregnancy complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Targeted lipid nanoparticle development</title><p id="Par11">We prepared LNPs by microfluidic mixing using the NanoAssemblr Benchtop (Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver, Canada). An ethanolic phase containing lipids was mixed with an acidic aqueous phase (25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0) containing nucleic acids leading to the formation of LNPs. Lipids were dissolved in 100% ethanol at a total lipid concentration ranging from 20 mM. LNPs were composed of DLin-MC3-DMA VKB (India), cholesterol Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA), DSPC Lipoid, (Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany), and PEG-DMG lipid NOF Corporation (Tokyo, JP),.at a molar percentage of 50, respectively.</p><p id="Par12">The nucleic acids mixture underwent encapsulation at a nitrogen-to-phosphate ratio (N/P) of six.

We prepared LNP samples using PBS pH&#8201;=&#8201;7.4 and we measured the scattering at an angle of 173&#186; at 37 &#186;C for 10&#160;s and repeated at least 10 times. Z-average sizes of three sequential measurements were collected and analyzed on size and polydispersity (PDI). PDI represents the distribution of size populations within a sample, ranging from 0.0 (perfectly uniform) to 1.0 (highly polydisperse). In lipid-based drug delivery, like liposomes, a PDI of 0.3 or lower indicates a homogeneous population of phospholipid vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Zeta potential was measured by laser Doppler electrophoresis on a Zetasizer Nano Z (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with minor modifications reported by Bukkems et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In brief, placenta perfusion of an intact cotyledon was started within 45&#160;min after delivery by canulation of the matching fetal vein and artery (6 mL/min) of a single cotyledon.</p><p id="Par21">To represent maternal circulation, four cannulas were inserted through the maternal decidual plate into the intervillous space (12 mL/min).</p><p id="Par22">Initially, both circulations were left open to wash out residual blood for a minimum of 45&#160;min. The washing buffer consisted of Krebs-Henseleit buffer, supplemented with 11.1 mM glucose and 2500 IU/L heparin (LEO Pharma, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). After wash-out, the solutions were changed to experimental buffers consisting of the same buffer supplemented with human albumin (maternal 34&#160;g/L and fetal 29&#160;g/L) (Albuman<sup>&#174;</sup>, Sanquin, Nijmegen, the Netherlands), and circulations were closed. The maternal buffer was gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> and the fetal buffer with 95% N2/5% CO2 while being kept at 37&#160;&#176;C at a pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Before infusion baseline samples were collected.</p><p id="Par23">The fluorescent-labeled LNPs (100ug/ml, 1 mL, mixture of all VHH targets) and antipyrine (100&#160;mg/L) were added to the closed maternal circulation, which had a total volume of 120 mL. Samples were taken at fixed time points from the maternal and fetal circulation and were stored at &#8722;&#8201;20&#160;&#176;C until analysis. At the end of the experiment, the placentas were flushed for thirty minutes with PBS after the perfusion of the LNPs. The perfused cotyledon was then cut into pieces and frozen in methyl butane on dry ice and stored at &#8722;&#8201;80&#160;&#176;C. Frozen placenta tissue was sectioned into 200&#160;&#956;m slices to perform multi-photon microscopy and into 10&#160;&#956;m for hematoxilin and eosine staining as an objective observation of placenta health after pefusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>LNP determination in maternal and fetal circulation</title><p id="Par24">The ability to prevent the transplacental transfer of the LNP was indirectly assessed by measuring the concentration of Cy5.5 in the sample. Cy5.5 fluorescence intensity of maternal and fetal circulation samples was measured (excitation/emission 680/710 nm) using a microplate reader (Spectramax ID5). Measurement of Cy5.5 concentration relied on a pre-established calibration curve, normalized to % of timepoint 0, and expressed as % circulating LNP in RFU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Antipyrine determination by LC-MS/MS</title><p id="Par25">For every placental perfusion, the control substance Antipyrine (molecular weight: 188 Da, logP: 0.38) was added to the maternal circulation (100&#160;mg/L). It undergoes rapid passive diffusion across the placental barrier and was used to confirm maternal and fetal circulation overlap.</p><p id="Par26">The collected samples were analyzed at the laboratory of the Department of Pharmacy, division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Radboud University Medical Center. Antipyrine measurements were performed using an LC-MS/MS method with an Acquity UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a Xevo TQ-S micro (Waters) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The internal standard d3-antipyrine (Toronto Research Chemicals) was used. Protein precipitation was achieved by the addition of acetonitrile to the samples in a ratio of 3:1. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 13,000&#160;rpm for 3&#160;min. Samples were injected on an Acquity UPLC HSST3 column and separation was accomplished via gradient elution (flowrate 0.300 mL/min).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">The fluorescently labeled LNPs were not observed in measurable quantities in the fetal perfusate of the ex vivo perfused healthy term placentas. The MPM imaging revealed no localization in fetal villous capillaries which confirms the results of the sample analyses of placental perfusion with no transport of LNP to the fetal circuit.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Transplacental passage of LNP in the placenta cotyledon perfusion model</title><p id="Par37">To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that targeted LNPs, used as a delivery system for nucleic acid therapeutics during pregnancy, prevent transplacental passage in the perfused human placenta model.</p><p id="Par38">The observed variance in the sample analyses of the maternal distribution could be attributed to inter-placental differences and the size differences of the selected cotyledon. The observed decrease in the number of LNPs in the first 30&#160;min can be partially attributed to the dilution of the maternal reservoir with the volume of remaining washing buffer inside the maternal circuit. Furthermore, this decrease could be due to the targeting of the LNP temporarily to placental tissue.</p><p id="Par39">The visible decrease in volume after three hours and the placenta containing more fluid could be a result of cell swelling. Cell swelling is a complex process influenced by several factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Prolonged perfusion can lead to an imbalance in the movement of fluids and solutes across cell membranes, resulting in osmotic stress and subsequent cell swelling. Similarly, inflammatory conditions can cause the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, disrupting normal cellular function and leading to changes in osmolality that contribute to cell swelling. As LNPs are widely used due to their established safety profile, as evidenced by their role in COVID-19 vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the safety observed with LNPs in COVID-19 vaccines may not be generalizable to other administration routes or non-vaccine applications. Recent research has shown that LNPs activate the innate immune system across various administration routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This activation leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which facilitate the infiltration of activated leukocytes. Thereby causing tissue damage and lead to the cell swelling. Whether the cell swelling is a delayed effect of LNPs, only becoming visible at the end of the perfusion period, or a result of the relatively long perfusion period (6&#160;h) itself, remains uncertain. Earlier studies investigating the disposition of biologics, also lasting for 6&#160;h, did not report notable placenta edema taking place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>MPM: a unique imaging technique to localize LNPs in complex placental tissue</title><p id="Par40">The visualization of LNPs is challenged by the complex structure of the placenta. While other studies apply immunofluorescence techniques to localize particles in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we used the autofluorescence signal of the tissue excited by MPM as a sophisticated imaging technique. The main advantage of this technique compared to other optical imaging methods lies in its ability to penetrate deeper into the sample, eliminating the need to slice the tissue thinly. Therefore the 3D morphology of the tissue is preserved. Imaging of the villi is based on their inherent autofluorescence signal, therefore there is no need for complex staining steps to the standard immunofluorescence technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This is particularly valuable in localizing the particles throughout a larger area in depth of tissue. Furthermore, processing of tissue for immunofluorescence staining can interfere with the existing fluorescent label of nanoparticles. Our study without extra stainings indeed showed a clear image of the borders of the syncytiotrophoblast villous tissue and the presence of LNPs with Cy5.5 fluorescent label in the maternal inter-villous space.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par41">Given that there is limited research focused on LNPs in human pregnancy, the present study enhanced our understanding and translational value of the transfer of nucleic acid-based LNPs across the placental barrier from mother to fetus. Specifically, as a therapeutic approach to target maternal or placental aspects with VHH nanobodies to guide the loaded LNPs to diseased tissues. The perfused human placenta model mimics the in vivo environment of the human placenta in (late) third trimester most efficiently. Therefore, this ex vivo model holds a high translational value and is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">We acknowledge some limitations. Firstly, the success rate of placenta cotyledon perfusion for over 6&#160;h was around 25%, therefore this study includes a small study group. Secondly, we cannot disprove the direct relation between LNPs and cell swelling in this data set. In the current study no control perfusions were conducted in which LNPs were not administered. Thirdly, we note that our data cannot be generalized to placentas in the first and second trimesters, as it is known that placental transfer varies with gestational age. Early pregnancy typically has higher placental permeability than at term and must be studied separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. While both are beyond the scope of this study, placental transfer could also be affected by pathological diseases where the capillary permeability increases under inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, this ex vivo human placenta perfusion model of healthy placentas inevitably unqualifies for determining the most optimal VHHs targeting for dysfunctional placental syndromes considering the different placental expression between healthy and dysfunctional placenta.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion and future perspectives</title><p id="Par43">We conclude from our results that the targeted LNPs as a nucleic acid drug nanocarrier prevent trans-placental passage after a six-hour perfusion in the ex vivo human healthy term placenta. The perfusion and localization data suggest that our targeted LNPs could be an effective therapeutic strategy during pregnancy to prevent crossing the placental barrier from mother to fetus. We demonstrated that MPM imaging technique forms a useful tool for localization of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles in research. Future research needs to be performed on transplacental passage during earlier stages of gestation to confirm our findings preventing crossing the placental barrier in late gestation. Secondly, assessing the efficacy of the targeted LNPs in dysfunctional placentas with altered vascular conditions. Under these conditions of increased capillary permeability, targeting specific cell types in diseased tissue by the VVHs could play a more significant role in preventing transplacental passage and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, subsequent research should explore the therapeutic potential of the loaded therapeutic nucleic acids into LNPs, particularly in disease models such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Lastly, these LNPs can be customized and assessed for their effectiveness in managing other pregnancy complications. Overall, targeted LNPs may provide a promising approach for site-specific delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics to the mother without significant transfer to the fetus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
