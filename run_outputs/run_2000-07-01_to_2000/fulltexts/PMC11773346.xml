mandated EFSA to assess the toxicity of bromide, the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs), and possible transfer from feed into food of animal origin. The critical effects of bromide in experimental animals are on the thyroid and central nervous system. Changes in thyroid hormone homeostasis could result in neurodevelopmental toxicity, among other adverse effects. Changes in thyroid hormone concentrations and neurophysiological parameters have also been observed in experimental human studies, but the evidence was limited. Dose&#8211;response modelling of decreased blood thyroxine concentrations in rats resulted in a reference point of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. The Scientific Committee established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.4 mg/kg bw per day and an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.4 mg/kg bw per day to protect against adverse neurodevelopmental effects. The TDI value is supported by the results of experimental human studies with a NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw per day and 10&#8208;fold interindividual variability. The TDI and ARfD are considered as conservative with 90% certainty. Insufficient evidence related to the toxicological effects of bromide was available for animals, with the exception of dogs. Therefore, the reference point of 40 mg/kg bw per day was extrapolated to maximum safe concentrations of bromide in complete feed for other animal species. Bromide can transfer from feed to food of animal origin, but, from the limited data, it was not possible to quantify the transfer rate. Monitoring data exceeded the current MRLs for some food commodities, generally with a low frequency. A conservative safety screening of the MRLs indicated that the TDI and ARfD are exceeded for some EU diets. Dietary exposure assessment for animals was not feasible due to insufficient data. The Scientific Committee recommends data be generated to allow robust dietary exposure assessments in the future, and data that support the risk assessment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0001">animal health</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0002">bromide</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0003">feed</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0004">health&#8208;based guidance value</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0005">human health</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0006">mode of action</kwd><kwd id="efs29121-kwd-0007">MRL</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="16"/><table-count count="37"/><page-count count="164"/><word-count count="88900"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January 2025</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.5.2 mode:remove_FC converted:28.01.2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

Algae and seaweeds were the primary feed materials of interest for exposure assessment relevant to animal health. Bromine&#8208;containing compounds, where bromine is covalently bound and/or possess toxicological properties that are not attributable to the bromide ion (e.g. methyl bromide, brominated flame retardants, brominated vegetable oils) were not relevant to the hazard assessment.</p><p>Bromine is naturally occurring and widely distributed in the environment as bromide. Bromide can be present in food and feed as a result of natural occurrence, environmental contamination from anthropogenic activity, use of certain biocidal products and use in veterinary medicinal products in food&#8208;producing animals. When measuring bromide in food and feed, it is not possible to determine the contributions from these different sources.</p><p>Most modern studies use chromatographic methods that are coupled to mass spectrometry for determination of bromide. These methods measure total elemental bromine and are more suitable than traditional methods using gravimetric analysis, titration with silver nitrate, or photometry, which are not generally sufficiently specific or sensitive for the determination of bromide in food and feed. When combined with a chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric methods can distinguish between bromide and compounds that contain bromine.</p><p>Bromide concentrations in seawater are generally in the range of 65 mg/L to well over 80 mg/L. Concentrations of bromide in fresh water are lower and typically range from trace amounts to about 0.5 mg/L and up to around 1 mg/L in desalinated waters.</p><p>The bromide ion is stable and water&#8208;soluble. It can therefore be assumed to migrate from food when it is cooked in water, assuming that the concentration in the food is greater than in the water that is used for cooking. If water is lost from food as it is cooked or processed, then it can be assumed that bromide will be lost with that water, but if fats or oils are lost during cooking or processing, then the bromide may remain in the food and hence the concentration could increase.</p><p>In humans, bromide bioavailability from the gastrointestinal tract is almost complete (96&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6%), similar to rodents but unlike dogs and horses (up to 46% and 38%, respectively). Bromide is primarily eliminated through the kidneys with an elimination half&#8208;life of 285&#8201;&#177;&#8201;34 h in humans.</p><p>There is evidence that bromide can transfer from feed to food of animal origin but from the limited data, it is not possible to quantify the transfer rate. Uncertainty remains over the impact of feeding macroalgae to ruminants on levels of bromide in milk or meat, and whether any increase is due to direct transfer or bromide from the feed or conversion of bromoform to bromide.</p><p>Bromide has low acute toxicity in experimental animals. In repeat dose studies, mainly in rats, bromide has shown evidence of effects on the central nervous system (CNS), kidneys, thyroid and other endocrine organs, and on bodyweight gain. The effects occurring at the lowest doses are on thyroid hormone homeostasis and the CNS. Effects on the thyroid and nervous system in dams were also reported in reproductive and developmental studies in rats. Reported neurotoxicity was generally related to clinical signs, such as abnormal gait, at doses in excess of 100 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. In one rat study, impaired performance in detailed functional observations was reported at doses of 184 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day, but not at 82 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day, with no associated histopathological findings. Based on the absence of any indication for genotoxicity, the negative result of a carcinogenicity study with design limitations and the mode of action (MOA) for thyroid effects, bromide is not expected to be carcinogenic to humans.</p><p>Effects on the thyroid include changes in serum thyroid hormone concentrations, particularly decreased serum total thyroxine (tT4), and triiodothyronine (tT3), and increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as increases in absolute/relative thyroid weights with morphological and histological changes. There is evidence that iodine deficiency decreases the iodine/bromide ratio in the thyroid and may increase the effects of bromide. The reported effects on the thyroid are supported by in&#160;vitro evidence of an MOA involving bromide competition of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS)&#8208;mediated iodide uptake in the thyroid. Based on the adverse outcome pathway, it is possible that changes in thyroid hormones may result in neurodevelopmental toxicity, depending on the timing, duration and effect size of thyroid hormone change.</p><p>In human studies, neurophysiological changes captured in electroencephalogram (EEG), including decrease in &#948;1&#8208; and &#948;2&#8208;activities, increased &#946;&#8208;activities and mean frequency (mobility parameter) and visual evoked responses, have been observed in groups of women of childbearing age given capsules with 9 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw daily for 12&#8201;weeks. Statistically significant increases in serum&#8208;free T4 (fT4), tT4 and tT3 were observed at the end compared to concentrations at the start of a study in females receiving bromide capsules at 9 mg/kg bw per day, but all concentrations remained within normal limits. However, an increase in TSH, but no change in tT4 was reported in a follow&#8208;up study. The NOAEL from these studies was 4 mg/kg bw per day. The Scientific Committee noted that there was no explanation for the increase in mean tT4 concentration in one of these studies, but that the increase in mean TSH concentration is indicative of effects on the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary&#8211;thyroid axis. The evidence obtained from studies in humans was not considered sufficient as a basis for establishing a health&#8208;based guidance value (HBGV).</p><p>Altered thyroid hormone (tT4) concentrations in rats were considered to be an early critical effect of bromide. Benchmark dose (BMD) modelling was performed on the data for decreased blood tT4 concentrations in studies conducted in rats in order to provide a potential reference point, with a benchmark response (BMR) of 20%. From the results of the modelling, a reference point of 40 mg/kg bw per day was identified for establishing a human HBGV. Based on the weight of evidence and applicable uncertainties, the Scientific Committee established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.4 mg/kg bw per day. An uncertainty factor of 100 was applied, including interspecies toxicokinetic differences (4), interindividual variability (10) and uncertainty in the database as described in the uncertainty analysis (2.5). Based on the assumption of similar sensitivity between rats and humans for the endpoint selected, an interspecies uncertainty factor for toxicodynamic differences was not required. This TDI is supported by the NOAEL of 4 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day from two studies in humans including a default uncertainty factor of 10 for interindividual variability. Considering the critical role that modest and transient perturbations of the thyroid hormones play in neurodevelopment during critical developmental windows, an acute reference dose (ARfD) equal to the TDI was established. Individuals who are iodine deficient may not be adequately protected by the TDI and ARfD. The impact of iodine deficiency is out of the scope of this assessment and warrants attention of public health authorities.</p><p>No sufficient relevant evidence related to the toxicological effects of bromide was available that was generated directly in specific species of food&#8208;producing and non&#8208;food&#8208;producing animals, with the exception of dogs. Effects reported in several species following bromide intake were limited to overt toxicity, whereas data on thyroid effects were available only for dogs. Therefore, the Scientific Committee adopted an extrapolation approach developed by the EFSA FEEDAP Panel to estimate maximum safe concentrations in complete feed (with 88% dry matter) for food&#8208;producing and non&#8208;food&#8208;producing species based on the reference point used to establish the TDI. For dogs, a maximum safe concentration of bromide of 103 mg/kg complete feed was established based on data in dogs. For cats, no maximum safe concentration in feed for bromide could be established due to the idiosyncratic response to bromide in this species.</p><p>A total of 46,965 bromide analytical results in matrices of foods intended for human consumption, i.e. raw agricultural commodities and processed food items collected in 29 European countries between 2013 and 2022 fulfilled the quality criteria applied and were considered in the assessment. The highest mean bromide concentrations were measured in the FoodEx2 food category &#8216;Coffee, cocoa, tea and infusions&#8217;, and in particular in dry forms of &#8216;flowers used for herbal infusions&#8217; (i.e. herbal infusions from flowers) and &#8216;herbal infusion materials from leaves and herbs&#8217;. Only a limited number of analytical data on bromide were available for feed (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;57).</p><p>As requested in the terms of reference, the occurrence levels of bromide obtained from monitoring data were compared to the current MRLs of bromide in foods. The MRLs were exceeded for a few raw agricultural commodities, however, for the majority of them the exceedances were at low frequencies (&lt;&#8201;10% of samples). The MRLs were exceeded with higher frequency in Brazil nuts (38% of samples), and in the food commodities of animal origin (up to 100% of samples of pig meat).</p><p>An exposure assessment for consumers was not requested in the terms of reference. A conservative screening of the MRLs was conducted for a hypothetical scenario in which bromide is present in foods at the concentrations of the MRLs and assuming that all such foods are consumed daily over the whole lifetime. This approach is defined as a high&#8208;level screening method and cannot be considered as a standard dietary exposure assessment. The chronic and acute outcomes of this scenario were compared to the TDI and ARfD, respectively. In the chronic calculation, the TDI was exceeded in 29 out of the 36 diets assessed by the model, with the highest exceedance calculated for Dutch toddlers, up to 528% of the TDI. Of the 29 diets, 17 covered adults or the general population. In the acute calculation, only the adult population is considered as relevant because the ARfD is set to protect during the pregnancy, the ARfD was exceeded for 54 raw commodities and for 31 processed commodities, with the highest exceedance calculated for boiled beetroots (486% of the ARfD). An additional screening was performed in which the MRL values were replaced with available monitoring data (considering upper bound and lower bound estimations) and the outcomes were compared to the TDI and ARfD. In the chronic calculations, the TDI was exceeded in one (lower bound) or two (upper bound) of the 36 diets assessed, with the highest exceedances, up to 127% of the TDI (lower bound) and up to 188% of the TDI (upper bound). In the acute calculations, according to the lower bound scenario, the ARfD was exceeded for two raw and two processed commodities (up to 151% for unprocessed chards) while in the upper bound scenario, the ARfD was exceeded for four raw and three processed commodities (up to 203% for watermelons). Data gaps were identified for drinking water and foods such as fish, other seafood, seaweed and algae, which are expected to be among the major contributors to dietary bromide intake in humans and/or animals, considering the presence of bromide in seawater.</p><p>Dietary exposure assessment and risk characterisation for food&#8208;producing and non&#8208;food&#8208;producing animals were not feasible due to lack of sufficient concentration data in feed materials and water for drinking.</p><p>The uncertainties associated with all areas of the assessment were identified. Based on expert judgement and a semi&#8208;formal Expert Knowledge Elicitation, the Scientific Committee concluded with 90% certainty that the TDI and ARfD are conservative. The Scientific Committee could not conclude on uncertainties in the risk to human health because an exposure assessment was not included in this opinion. The Scientific Committee could not characterise the uncertainty in the risk to animal health due to limitations in the toxicity data and the lack of data for exposure assessment.</p><p>The Scientific Committee recommends that, for better characterisation of the hazard of bromide, key additional studies be performed with relevant thyroid endpoints, according to agreed quality standards, including an in&#160;vivo developmental neurotoxicity study, and observational and/or experimental human studies. The Scientific Committee also recommends that further research be encouraged to better understand the MOA of bromide and identify other possible adverse outcomes. The Scientific Committee recommends that, for a complete risk assessment of bromide, dietary exposure assessments for humans and animals be performed. For this purpose, it is recommended that occurrence data for food and feed materials be generated and submitted by data providers, using more sensitive analytical methods. In particular, occurrence data are needed for fish and seafood; infant formulae and drinking water; algae and other aquatic animals and their products used as feed materials. Lastly, the Scientific Committee recommends that data related to transfer of bromide from feed to food of animal origin be generated.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0002"><label>1</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><sec id="efs29121-sec-0003"><label>1.1</label><title>Background and terms of reference as provided by the requestor</title><sec sec-type="background" id="efs29121-sec-0004"><label>1.1.1</label><title>Background</title><p>

The review also considered bromide ion as the main metabolite and assessed the Codex maximum limits (CXL) set for bromide ion.</p><p>EFSA concluded that the default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg for methyl bromide, as defined by Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 &#8208; and compliant with the Codex guideline levels for methyl bromide &#8208; provides a satisfactory level of protection for the European consumers, but that it was not demonstrated that the default MRL can be achieved in routine enforcement. For bromide ion, specific CXLs were available, but data were insufficient to determine whether the CXLs were derived from the pesticide use of methyl bromide or whether they were based on the natural occurrence of bromide ion.</p><p>EFSA considered that the ADI of 1.0 mg /kg bw established by JMPR for bromide ion, the main metabolite of methyl bromide, was not sufficiently supported by data and that the necessity of an acute reference dose (ARfD) for bromide ion should be re&#8208;assessed. Acute exposure calculations were not carried out because an ARfD was not available for this compound. As the toxicological reference values derived by JMPR and considered in this calculation (of the ADI) were not fully supported by EFSA, the risk assessment for bromide ion was subject to a high level of uncertainty.</p><p>In 2021, in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, section Phytopharmaceuticals &#8211; Pesticides Residues, Member States requested to revise the MRLs for substances which occur naturally but for which Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 395/2005 inclusion is not recommended.

The conclusion was based on the observed adverse effects in the thyroid gland in the studies on rats and dogs combined with data obtained from a literature search conducted on bromide effects on the thyroid. Bromide may substitute iodide in the sodium/iodide symporter of the thyroid, thus creating a relative iodide insufficiency for further synthesis of thyroid hormones. This shows a link between the observed adverse effects in the thyroid and endocrine activity, which is relevant for humans and non&#8208;target species.</p><p>

It stated that data on bromide in soils are scarce, but bromine content varies considerably ranging from as small as 0.3 up to 852 mg/kg. Larger concentrations are found in soil close to the sea and seaborne aerosols are the main natural source of bromide in terrestrial ecosystems. Those authors stated that, at that time, the three major anthropogenic releases of bromide into the environment were from mining, from emissions of 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane (a scavenger in leaded fuel), and from the use of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture (Flury &amp; Papritz,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0090" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).</p><p>Bromide levels in rainwater are variable, possibly due to factors including pollution (JMPR,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0128" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Lundstr&#246;m &amp; Olin,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0158" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; VanBriesen,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0278" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).

An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) and ICP&#8208;MS were used to measure total elemental bromine in wheat and pea seedlings in a study on biogeochemical cycles (Shtangeeva et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0239" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>&#8216;Eco&#8208;friendly&#8217; alternatives have been developed more recently. A &#8216;green&#8217; analytical method developed for the determination of halogens and sulfur in pet food used microwave&#8208;induced combustion with ion chromatography and conductivity or mass spectrometric detection (IC&#8208;CD and IC&#8208;MS) (de Mello et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A vortex&#8208;assisted matrix solid&#8208;phase dispersion was used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative for the determination of halogens in edible seaweed (de Melo Malinowski et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>In summary, most modern studies use chromatographic methods that are coupled to mass spectrometry for detection, and these methods measure total elemental bromine and are more suitable than traditional methods using gravimetric analysis, titration with silver nitrate, or photometry, which are not generally sufficiently specific or sensitive for the determination of bromide in food and feed. When combined with a chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric methods can distinguish between bromide and compounds that contain bromine.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0012"><label>1.3.5</label><title>Previous assessments</title><p>The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) has evaluated bromide in the context of its evaluation of methyl bromide. In JMPR&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0126" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>) concluded that it was probable that most if not all of the residue persisting in foodstuffs fumigated with methyl bromide would be in the form of the bromide ion, but since nothing was known about the chronic oral toxicity of methyl bromide, no acceptable daily intake (ADI) could be assigned to methyl bromide as a residue. In 1966, JMPR confirmed that no ADI could be established for methyl bromide and concluded that the safety of food products treated with methyl bromide could be assessed on the basis of their bromide content because by far the major part, if not all, of the residue which persists in foodstuffs fumigated with methyl bromide in accordance with ordinary commercial practice is in the form of bromide (JMPR,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0127" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). JMPR subsequently established an ADI for bromide of 0&#8211;1.0 mg/kg bw (JMPR,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0127" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>) based on the minimum pharmacologically effective dose in humans of 900 mg KBr, equivalent to 600 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> or 10 mg/kg bw per day in a 60&#8208;kg adult. Although not clearly stated in the JMPR monograph, the Scientific Committee assumed that an uncertainty factor of 10 was applied to allow for intra&#8208;individual variation.</p><p>JMPR subsequently evaluated bromide, in the light of newer studies in experimental animals and human volunteers (JMPR,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0129" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). It was noted that, at high doses, bromide resulted in effects on the nervous system, but the main effects were on endocrine organs, particularly the thyroid, adrenal glands and testes. The effect on the thyroid was attributed to interaction with iodide uptake and was considered to be the most sensitive effect in animal experiments. A NOAEL of 12 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day was identified based on effects of NaBr on the thyroid in rats. JMPR also reported a number of human volunteer studies, including a series of studies in females receiving doses of NaBr equal to 0, 4 and 9 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, showing marginal effects on neurophysiological data (EEG and visual evoked response) at the highest dose, but no effects on thyroid hormones (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0233" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0231" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). JMPR considered the neurophysiological changes to be within normal limits and concluded that the NOAEL in human volunteer studies was 9 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. Taking into account the NOAELs from both the rat and human studies, the JMPR confirmed the previously established ADI for bromide of 0&#8211;1.0 mg/kg bw.</p><p>EMEA noted the JMPR conclusions but concluded that more recent human volunteer studies indicated a NOAEL of 4 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day, and therefore set an ADI of 0.4 mg/kg bw, applying a safety (uncertainty) factor of 10 (EMEA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0082" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). EMEA did not provide references in its summary report but noted that the NOAEL was based on studies in which changes in electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements were the most sensitive indicator of bromide toxicity.</p><p>The WHO has published an evaluation of the toxicity of bromide in the context of developing guidelines for drinking water quality (WHO, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0291" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This drew on the data published by JMPR, but also noted the evaluation by EMEA&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0082" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and adopted the EMEA ADI of 0.4 mg/kg bw, i.e. 24 mg/person for a 60&#8208;kg person. Assuming a relative source contribution of 50% of the ADI from drinking water, the WHO concluded that the drinking water value for a 60&#8208;kg adult consuming 2 L water per day would be up to 6 mg/L. For a 10&#8208;kg child consuming 1 L water per day, the value would be up to 2 mg/L.</p><p>In 2013, EFSA published a reasoned opinion on the review of the existing MRLs for methyl bromide (EFSA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). These MRLs are established for bromide, the main metabolite of methyl bromide in food and feed. The 2013 EFSA opinion noted that the toxicological profile of bromide had been evaluated by JMPR but considered that the ADI of 1.0 mg/kg bw for bromide was not sufficiently supported by the data and that an ARfD for bromide should be reassessed.</p><p>The Biocidal Products Committee (BPC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has published opinions on 1,2&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,4&#8208;dicyanobutane (DBDCB) (ECHA BCP,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and on 2,2&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoacetamide (DBNPA) (ECHA BPC,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), both of which release bromide. The BPC noted that the only systemic effect of DBDCB was enlargement of the thyroid gland, observed in dogs, which was attributed to the release of bromide. Similarly, the BPC concluded that DBNPA has adverse effects on the thyroid gland in studies on rats and dogs and that these effects were attributable to bromide.</p><p>The Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) of ECHA has assessed ammonium bromide in the context of harmonised classification and labelling at the EU level, taking into account unpublished reports submitted by sponsors, studies published in the scientific literature and read&#8208;across from other bromide salts (ECHA RAC,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The evaluation considered whether ammonium bromide met the ECHA criteria for specific target organ toxicity (STOT), i.e. that effects are observed at doses &#8804;&#8201;100 mg/kg bw per day. The RAC considered a proposal that the thyroid should be classified as a target organ and noted the conflicting results of a number of studies with respect to doses at which thyroid effects occurred. The RAC concluded that the reported effects on thyroid in rats, and the related MOA can be relevant for humans, but that the severity of effects on the thyroid were not sufficient to fulfil the criteria for classification. For neurotoxicity, the RAC concluded that the human case reports of poisoning, supported by the evidence from animal studies, warranted a classification of &#8216;causes damage to the nervous system through prolonged or repeated exposure&#8217;. The RAC further concluded that classification for effects on sexual function and fertility, on development and effects on or via lactation was justified. More recently, the RAC has evaluated sodium, potassium and calcium bromide (ECHA RAC,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>), based on the same data set as for ammonium bromide (primarily on ammonium bromide and sodium bromide). The RAC concluded that bromide salts meet the criteria for classification with respect to effects on the nervous system, thyroid and reproduction and development.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0013"><label>1.3.6</label><title>Legislation</title><p>Active substances are approved for use as plant protection products under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009<xref rid="efs29121-note-1012" ref-type="fn">

</title><p>As specified in the terms of reference, the Scientific Committee performed the screening of existing MRLs for bromide. For this purpose, the Pesticide Residue Intake Model (PRIMo) version 3.1<xref rid="efs29121-note-1036" ref-type="fn">

This approach is defined as a high&#8208;level screening method and cannot be considered as a standard dietary exposure assessment.</p><p>PRIMo is a tool specifically developed to carry out risk assessment of pesticide residues in feed and foods included in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 396/2005. The tool is typically used to assess chronic and acute dietary consumer exposure using the median or highest pesticide residue levels expected for each food commodity, respectively. These levels are derived from supervised field trials conducted during pesticide pre&#8208;authorisation assessments or MRL reviews. For chronic exposure, it is assumed that all food commodities (e.g. fruits, vegetables, cereals, meat, etc.) for which the pesticide is/will be authorised contains the median residue concentrations and is based on mean food consumption over the whole lifetime. For the acute exposure, it is assumed that a consumer is eating, within a short period of time (one day or meal), a large portion of the food commodity containing the highest pesticide residue level measured in the supervised residue trials. In its typical use, PRIMo incorporates the assessments of proposed MRLs and existing MRLs based on authorised uses for pesticides against the chronic (ADI) or acute toxicological reference dose (ARfD), respectively, such that the final output of the tool is given as % of ADI and % of ARfD (EFSA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0069" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this opinion, comparison of the calculated &#8216;intake of bromide&#8217; based on MRLs is compared to the TDI and ARfD established for bromide as a screening of MRL safety.</p><p>The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) assessment of bromide is an atypical application of the PRIMo tool, in which the existing MRLs for bromide are used instead of the median and highest residue levels of field trial data. This implementation assumes the presence of bromide in the foods at levels equal to the MRLs and assesses consumer exposure and risk conservatively under conditions of maximum bromide residue levels. It is also an atypical application of the PRIMo tool for a non&#8208;pesticide exposure assessment since methyl bromide is no longer in use as plant protection product.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0033"><label>2.8</label><title>Screening of monitoring data</title><p>Although not requested in the mandate, further screening was performed based on the monitoring data submitted to EFSA. For each raw agricultural commodity, a statistical analysis was performed to derive the input value to be considered in the calculations. The principles of deriving these input values are following the same principles as establishing MRLs on the basis of occurrence data. For commodities with number of observations (obs) &#8805;&#8201;59, the input values cover the 95th percentile (P95) at the upper confidence interval (CI95). For the commodities with &lt;&#8201;59 obs, but at least 29 obs, the 90th percentile was considered (29&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;obs &lt;&#8201;59, P90%), while for commodities with &lt;&#8201;29 obs but at least 5 obs, the 50th percentile (median) was considered (5&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;obs&#8201;&lt;&#8201;29, P50%). The commodities that did not have data for at least five samples were not considered. The estimations were calculated for both LB and UB levels.</p><p>For the screening based on monitoring data, the Scientific Committee considered it appropriate to calculate two scenarios; the first scenario was based on a lifetime consumption and the second scenario was based on consumption over a short period of time (one day or meal).</p><p>

</p><p>After oral administration, bromide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the extracellular water space. In a study designed to assess the kinetics of bromide, healthy adult volunteers were given a dose of 30 mg of sodium bromide solution/kg bw (23.3 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw) (Vaiseman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). The bioavailability of bromide was found to be complete in the fasting state, with an oral bioavailability of 96&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6%. The volume of distribution was 0.408&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.017 L/kg bw. Bromide is eliminated from the body primarily through the kidneys. The half&#8208;life of bromide after oral and intravenous administration was found to be 285.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;33.6 h and 225.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;36 h, respectively. The apparent clearance of bromide was 26&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.7 mL/day per kg bw (Vaiseman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>).</p><p>In another study, a single oral dose of sodium bromide (50 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw) was administered to healthy volunteers (Miller &amp; Kornhauser,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0174" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The volume of distribution was found to be 0.274&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.030 L/kg bw, which is slightly lower than the value reported by Vaiseman et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). The clearance values were also lower, at 16.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.76 mL/day per kg bw.</p><p>It is worth noting that a low salt diet may significantly prolong the half&#8208;life of bromide and potentially increase its toxicity (Vaiseman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Langley&#8208;Czerwinski&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0146" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>) demonstrated the competition between chloride and bromide for tubular reabsorption, leading to the conclusion that an elevated chloride load would enhance bromide clearance and result in a reduction of its half&#8208;life (Langley&#8208;Czerwinski,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0146" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>).</p><p>

<italic toggle="yes">Distribution</italic>
</p><p>Bromides have physicochemical properties most similar to those of chloride and, to a lesser extent, to iodide, and their distribution and action are directly related to these other halides (Pavelka,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0200" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The distribution of both chloride and bromide is mostly extracellular, except for erythrocytes and acinar cells of the gastric wall, which can contain both ions (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). In the extracellular fluid, bromide ions replace an equivalent amount of chloride ions, so the molar sum of total halides remains constant at approximately 110&#8201;mmol/L. Bromide can penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. The volume of distribution of bromide in rats is reported to be 3 L/kg bw (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).</p><p>Chloride is transported more readily than bromide into the cerebrospinal fluid. Due to elimination by cerebrospinal fluid flow at the same rate for both ions, bromide never reaches the same cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratio as chloride. As a result, plateau levels in the central nervous system are reached later than in plasma (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). In a kinetic study with male Wistar rats (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5, 10&#8201;weeks old), bromide concentration and half&#8208;life were determined for a list of organs and tissues (15 compartments including blood) in rats exposed for 17&#8201;days via drinking water containing 50 mg <sup>82</sup>Br/L (Pavelka, Babick&#253;, Vobeck&#253;, Lener, &amp; Svandov&#225;,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0208" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Pavelka, Babick&#253;, Vobeck&#253;, &amp; Lener,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0206" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The half&#8208;life values ranged from 94 h in the thyroid gland to 235 h in the liver, and in most of the studied tissues, the values were shorter than the whole body elimination half&#8208;life of about 198 h (Pavelka, Babick&#253;, Vobeck&#253;, Lener, et&#160;al., 2000).</p><p>In lactating Wistar rats (8&#8211;10&#8201;weeks old, 5 per group) orally exposed to sodium bromide (drinking water, 1 or 5 g/L, equivalent to 220 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> per day), bromide was distributed into milk and was then transferred to their pups. This transfer occurred already 3 h after exposure to <sup>82</sup>Br with 3% of the applied amount to the mother retrieved in the body of the young and gradually increasing during the next 22 h (up to 17%) (Vobeck&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0288" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

The authors found a half&#8208;life value (110 h) very close to the measured value of the biological half&#8208;life of iodine and consistent with the iodine half&#8208;life (106 h) published earlier (Singh et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0240" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The almost identical half&#8208;life values of bromine and iodine in the rat thyroid are considered as evidence that the biological behaviour of bromine within this tissue, unlike other organs, is more akin to that of iodine rather than that of chlorine (Vobeck&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0286" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). van Leeuwen &amp; Sangster&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0272" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) had concluded that there is a direct correlation between concentrations of bromide in mammalian thyroid and concentrations in blood.</p><p>

</p><p>The kidneys are the primary route of excretion for both chloride and bromide. After glomerular filtration, most of both halogen ions are reabsorbed in renal tubules and, due to the similarity of their physicochemical properties, bromide and chloride compete for tubular reabsorption (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Thus, at a higher chloride exposure, bromide renal tubular reabsorption will decrease, causing a decrease in its half&#8208;life and an increase in its clearance, as observed in both humans (Vaiseman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) and dogs (Fantinati et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0086" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; March et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0166" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Trepanier &amp; Babish,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0262" ref-type="bibr">1995b</xref>).</p><p>An inverse relationship between the half&#8208;life of bromide in Wistar rats (3 females and 2 males per group) and sodium intake regardless of the anion (Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub>

Observed half&#8208;lives of bromide ranged from 104&#8201;&#177;&#8201;23 h to 325&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 h with sodium intake of 142.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;11.7 mg/day and 37.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.2 mg/day, respectively. Bromide clearance was 60 mL/day per kg bw in rats maintained on typical diets and decreased to 7.2 mL/day per kg bw with a salt&#8208;free diet (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).</p><p>Distribution and elimination processes of bromide are both linear until very high doses (19.2 g/kg bw) (Rauws,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0220" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).

Based on this model and the kinetic information for different species and the steady&#8208;state tissue/plasma ratio for these species, it would have been possible to extrapolate the concentration in different tissues from an oral exposure. However, the only tissue/plasma ratio reported comes from a rat study and after 17&#8201;days of exposure, which is not sufficient to reach steady state (Pavelka et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0204" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Since the half&#8208;life of bromide in rats is estimated at around 8&#8201;days, the duration of the study would need to be at least five half&#8208;lives, i.e. 40&#8201;days of exposure. Given these data gaps, it is not possible to estimate the amount of bromide in food of animal origin from the exposure to the animal.</p><p>However, a few studies in the literature provide evidence for transfer of bromide to tissues that are relevant as human food. Bromide excretion in the milk of lactating dairy cows was observed when it is present in their diet (Lynn et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0159" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>). Based on a review of total bromide in milk from various locations in the United States where methyl bromide was not used, Lynn et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0159" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>) concluded that the naturally occurring bromide in feed corresponds to milk concentrations of 1&#8211;5 mg Br/kg. In a pilot experiment, the impact of sodium bromide supplementation on milk production in lactating cows was investigated. One lactating cow was administered daily doses of 12.5 g of NaBr for 5 consecutive days. Blood and milk samples were collected and subsequently analysed for total bromide content. Milk bromide was correlated with increasing blood levels and varied from 10 to 60 mg Br&#8722;/kg milk.</p><p>In a more comprehensive follow&#8208;up study reported in the same publication, sodium bromide was incorporated into concentrate feed at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mg Br&#8722;/kg DM and administered consecutively (from low to high) to four cows for 22, 18 and 28&#8201;days corresponding to intakes of 175, 350 and 700 mg Br&#8722;/day, respectively (based on a mean feed intake of 3.5 kg concentrate per day and cow). At the end of the respective feeding periods, the mean concentration of bromide in milk was 2, 4 and 12 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg milk after feeding with 50, 100 and 200 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg feed concentrate DM, respectively. Concentrate feed was given to the cows at the rate of 1 kg concentrate feed per 4 kg of milk produced. The authors concluded that milk bromide apparently reached a steady state after 20&#8211;30&#8201;days.

Reduced fertility and numbers of live pups were reported at a dietary concentration equivalent to about 340 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. At lower doses (equivalent to 5&#8211;84 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day), the only effect reported was a dose related decrease in serum tT4 concentration (van Leeuwen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0271" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Significantly dose dependent decreased tT4 concentrations in the serum in both groups of the F0 parent animals were reported after 6&#8201;weeks, with males being more sensitive. Total T4 concentration in serum was significantly decreased as soon as 3&#8201;days of treatment and it remained constant during an experimental period of 12&#8201;weeks.</p><p>In an unpublished report (Study report 2001, summary in (ECHA RAC,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)), a dose&#8208;range finding study for reproductive toxicity was conducted on ammonium bromide in rats at dietary concentrations equivalent to 0, 104, 198 and 410 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day for males and 0, 186, 370, 631 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day for females, dosing from 2&#8201;weeks prior to mating through to PND77. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity (e.g. hunched posture, decreased motor activity, ataxia), and decreased fertility and pup viability were observed with a NOAEL of 104 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day. In another unpublished report (Study Report,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0251" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>), a two&#8208;generation study conducted in rats with gavage administration of sodium bromide equal to 0, 39, 136 and 272 (M)/388 (F) mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day showed reduced fertility and effects on reproductive organs, with a NOAEL of 39 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day.</p><p>

An increase of thyroid weight relative to body weight was also observed in pups in both groups. However, this was likely due to the decreased body weights since the absolute thyroid weight was not increased. Furthermore, a decrease of milk production in the dams was demonstrated at the higher dose (Pavelka, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0204" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0201" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).

According to Pavelka (Pavelka,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0201" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), the effects on pup weight in this study commenced on PND4; only about one&#8208;half of the young of top dose group survived and their general condition was very poor.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0043"><label>3.1.3.3</label><title>Genotoxicity studies</title><p>According to a personal communication cited by JMPR, sodium and ammonium bromide did not exert mutagenicity in <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 with or without metabolic activation (JMPR,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0129" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>).

DBDCB is totally debrominated prior to systemic distribution, releasing two bromide ions from one molecule of DBDCB, together with 2&#8208;methyleneglutaronitrile (2&#8208;MGN). This reaction also occurs in blood in&#160;vitro, and the Scientific Committee considered it likely that it also occurs in cultured cells in&#160;vitro. The BPC concluded that DBDCB did not induce mutations in a bacterial Ames test or a mammalian cell gene mutation test (in hamster lung cells) with and without metabolic activation. An in&#160;vitro chromosomal aberration assay (in CHO cells) showed an increased frequency of aberrant metaphases, with and without activation, at concentrations exerting marked cytotoxicity. An in&#160;vitro UDS assay in cultured human fibroblasts produced negative results, with and without activation. Negative results were obtained in two in&#160;vivo assays in mice: a bone marrow micronucleus test at doses sufficient to exert systemic toxicity, and a dominant&#8208;lethal assay (ECHA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-8101" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the BPC evaluated DBNPA, which is readily debrominated.

A dose&#8208;related increase in thyroid weight relative to body weight after 13&#8201;weeks of exposure to bromide was demonstrated in female rats starting from 84 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day.

The height of follicular epithelium was increased, while the colloid was decreased in amount and was more granular in appearance, after a longer exposure time (12&#8201;weeks) at the highest dose only. There was no evidence of pathological continuum in the thyroid (no differences in the subjective severity score between 4 and 12&#8208;week time points and no signs of progression through thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia at any time point). Overall, the observed pattern of hormonal and histological changes is evidence of activation of the hypothalamus&#8208;pituitary&#8208;thyroid (HPT) axis, and this is further supported by the time&#8208;related increased number of TSH producing cells in the pituitary gland at 4&#8208; and 12&#8208;week sampling points (conducted only for animals belonging to the top dose).</p><p>van Leeuwen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0274" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>) also demonstrated thyroid effects in male and female rats, at 10&#8208;fold lower doses (35&#8211;140 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day) under low chloride intake. Histological and ultrastructural changes in thyroid of bromide exposed male rats, was also observed at lower doses (0.9&#8211;36 mg/kg bw per day) and at several times of exposure (16, 66 and 133&#8201;days) (Velick&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0282" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Duskov&#225;, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0280" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Lojda, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0283" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p>Velicky et&#160;al. reported morphological changes in the thyroid, characterised by increased number of microfollicles, increased mitotic activity with statistically significant higher numbers of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive nuclei (Velick&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0282" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Duskov&#225;, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0280" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Lojda, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0283" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). However, the level of positive PCNA thyroid follicular cells decreased with the time of exposure, indicating that there was no progression despite continued exposure. Ultrastructural analysis (Velick&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0281" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) performed on the follicular cells showed an enlargement of tubular structures (endoplasmic reticulum), an increased number of subapical granules with elongation of the microvilli facing the lumen of the follicles and increased surface pits. The overall pattern of morphological changes described by the study's authors is suggestive of thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy. The extent of morphological changes appeared to increase with the dose of bromide but after 16&#8208; and 66&#8208;day treatment they did not differ conspicuously at any given dose. Indeed, the most obvious histological features were seen at 6 and 12 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day, but at the highest dose of 36 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day, there was no corresponding increase in the severity of the lesion.</p><p>Overall, in&#160;vivo experimental studies conducted in rats indicate that exposure to bromide induces thyroid follicular activation which is expected to be associated with increased production of thyroglobulin. However, several limitations were recorded for the Velicky et&#160;al. studies questioning the consistency of the perturbation of the HPT axis at lower doses (see Appendix&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-app-0001" ref-type="app">A</xref>). This is also substantiated by lack of changes in TSH, lack of a clear dose response, low magnitude of the effect, if any, and by the variability of some parameters (e.g. tT4 levels). The risk of bias and the inconsistencies identified in these studies do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on the dose&#8211;response relationship of bromide effects on the HPT axis. Although these results do not contradict the conclusions by Loeber et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0153" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>), on bromide induced thyroid follicular cell activation, they are not considered as sufficient evidence of an adverse perturbation of the HPT axis.</p><p>The OECD TG 408 90&#8208;day study indicates decreased tT3 and tT4 and increased TSH at 136 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day as compared to concurrent controls, suggesting a bromide effect on the HPT axis (Study Report,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0252" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). Consistently, at this dose, the reduced colloid at histopathological examination likely reflects a condition of follicular cell activation consequent to sustained TSH stimulation.

The effects reported included increase of the absolute/relative thyroid weight, histopathological and morphological changes, with statistically significant and dose&#8208;dependent decreases in serum thyroid hormones, mainly tT4.

Baseline bromide concentrations for the 5, 24 and 30 mg KBr/day groups were (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD) 5.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.32, 5.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.6 and 5.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.6 mg/L, respectively. Steady state was reached after 6&#8211;10&#8201;weeks with bromide concentrations of 11.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.4, 16.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.2 and 20.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.6 mg/L, respectively. Four weeks after the end of the KBr supplementation, blood concentrations returned to the baseline concentrations. There was considerable inter&#8208;individual variability in blood concentrations of KBr, likely due to variability in absorption and clearance among individuals. This suggests that the use of blood Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> concentrations as a biomarker of exposure could be more useful to differentiate between groups than between individuals. The authors observed that taking into account body weight could improve the correlation between dose and serum bromide concentration (Braam et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Little information is available about the suitability of urinary bromide concentrations to reflect exposure, thus precluding a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of this biomarker with reference to bromide dietary intake, while for occupational exposure urinary bromide has been shown to reflect a high level of exposure (Hanley et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kawai et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0133" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Tubular reabsorption of bromide is faster than that of chloride, thus excretion of bromide can be increased or decreased by administering a salt&#8208;deficient diet or an excess of chloride ions, respectively (Vaiseman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0269" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). This makes urinary concentration less reliable as biomarker of bromide exposure.</p><p>Among the limited information available on the relation between dietary and urinary bromide, one study has assessed the correlation between dietary patterns, in terms of food consumption, and urinary bromide concentration in East Asia. Bromide concentration in spot urines was positively correlated with consumption of various food groups at 10 survey sites, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.5 for fruits, algae, fish and shellfish intake (Kawai et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0134" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0051"><label>3.1.4.2</label><title>Adverse health effects of therapeutic application of bromide</title><p>Bromide has been used as an antiepileptic medicine and sedative at doses as high as 31 g/day, but the usual administered dose does not exceed 6 g/day (100 mg/kg bw per day) (EMEA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0082" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Bromism is the term used to describe symptoms associated with elevated blood bromide concentrations. Symptoms can be mild (tiredness, lack of concentration and drowsiness). Large doses of bromide cause nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, coma and paralysis. Doses of bromide giving blood concentrations of 959 mg/L produce bromism (the chronic state of bromide intoxication), and plasma concentrations greater than 3196 mg/L can be fatal (EMEA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0082" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Bromism is associated with effects on the nervous, dermal, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems (van Leeuwen &amp; Sangster,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0272" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Effects on the nervous system include restlessness, headache, delirium and dementia. Other neurologic changes, such as diminished deep tendon reflexes, loss of pupil reflexes, papilledema, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, slowing of the delta waves on electroencephalogram, loss of the gag reflex and anorexia may occur (Ryan &amp; Baumann,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0228" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>Generally, therapeutic use of bromide is associated with serum bromide concentrations of 5&#8211;50 mg/L. Toxic concentrations range from 700 to 4100 mg/L and concentrations &gt;&#8201;2000 mg/L may be fatal. Cases of bromism have been reported at concentrations as low as 40 mg/L (Health Council of the Netherlands,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0112" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Lugassy &amp; Nelson&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0156" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) considered toxic concentrations of bromide in blood to be &gt;&#8201;500 mg/L, and severe systemic toxicity can occur at concentrations &gt;&#8201;2000 mg/L. However, these authors also noted that lower serum bromide concentrations were associated with adverse health effects, indicating that other factors, such as chronicity of exposure, age, blood volume and renal function can alter the effect for a given serum bromide concentration (Lugassy &amp; Nelson,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0156" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>An acute overdose of bromide salts can result in nausea and vomiting due to the irritating effect of bromides on the gastrointestinal tract.

In the 9&#8208;mg group, 11 women had an increased TSH concentration after three menstrual cycles and four had a decreased TSH concentration.</p><p>When comparing the results of these studies, the Scientific Committee notes that the serum bromide concentrations in the group of women who received 9 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day in the study by Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0231" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>)/van Gelderen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0270" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) were higher than the concentrations in women receiving the same amount of bromide in the study by Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>): 638 compared to 394 mg/L, respectively. Serum bromide concentrations in these studies (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0233" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) increased more in women than in men following NaBr administration per kg bw. The possible reasons for these differences in bromide serum concentrations were not discussed by the authors.</p><p>The Scientific Committee also notes that the doses in these studies did not take into account background exposure from food and drinking water. The typical daily dietary intake of bromide in the United States of America was reported as 2&#8211;8 mg (Nielsen &amp; D.

</underline>
</p><p>Suboptimal thyroid function is associated with infertility, miscarriage and poor growth and neurodevelopment of the fetus (Griebel&#8208;Thompson et&#160;al., <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0902" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). The fetal thyroid is not fully functional until mid&#8208;pregnancy (18&#8211;20&#8201;weeks) and the fetus depends on the maternal thyroid hormone. Thus, placental transfer of maternal thyroid hormones during early pregnancy is crucial, as is the maternal iodine status (Hall et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Korevaar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0141" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Decrease of maternal serum T4 is the principal factor leading to poorer neurodevelopment of the child regardless of TSH increase (Morreale de Escobar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0178" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Thyroid hormone insufficiency in humans, even when it is mild, can produce adverse effects in specific neuropsychological functions, depending on the developmental timing of the deficiency and the brain region, including impaired visual processing development (Mirabella et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0175" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), learning and memory deficits (Henrichs et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0115" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zoeller &amp; Rovet,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0300" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). For example, thyroid hormone deficiency early in pregnancy is associated with reduced visual attention, visual processing (i.e. acuity and strabismus) and gross motor skills in the offspring. If it occurs later in pregnancy, children are at additional risk of subnormal visual (i.e. contrast sensitivity) and visuospatial skills, as well as slower response speeds and fine motor deficits. Finally, if thyroid hormone insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller &amp; Rovet,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0300" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Even modest degrees of thyroid hormone disruption experienced in utero can result in neuropsychological deficits in children despite normal thyroid status at birth (Finken et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0088" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Korevaar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0141" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Pop et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0216" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Pop et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0215" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Soldin,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0242" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Zoeller,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0298" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Zoeller &amp; Crofton,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0299" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>A population&#8208;based prospective cohort study, embedded within the Generation R Study (Rotterdam, The Netherlands), showed that fT4 and TSH serum concentrations in pregnant women (&lt;&#8201;18&#8201;weeks pregnant) higher or lower than the optimal ranges for the cohort were associated with adverse outcomes of child neurodevelopment, measured as mean total grey matter volume, mean cortex volume, and IQ at the age of 6&#8211;8&#8201;years (Jansen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0123" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Korevaar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0141" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Based on these data, U.S. EPA estimated that a 10%&#8211;20% decrease in maternal serum fT4 during the first trimester was associated with a 0.6&#8211;1.1&#8208;point decline in child IQ at age 6&#8211;8&#8201;years (U.S. EPA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0266" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Because of the importance of thyroid function during pregnancy, measuring the effect of bromide on thyroid hormones in young women is relevant for risk assessment.</p><p>When the Collaborative Perinatal Project (Klebanoff,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0139" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) had monitored 50,282 mother&#8211;child pairs, 986 had been exposed to bromides in the first trimester of pregnancy and 2610 at any time during pregnancy (Heinonen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0113" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). There was no firm evidence to suggest a relationship to malformations. Case reports are described in literature of two male infants with intrauterine growth restriction from a mother who chronically ingested a product containing bromides (Bromo&#8208;Seltzer) (Opitz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0195" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). One infant also had congenital heart disease. Another case reported on a woman who chronically ingested tablets containing bromides throughout gestation. The female infant growth was restricted at birth and at 2.5&#8201;years of age had a persistent developmental delay (Rossiter &amp; Rendle&#8208;Short,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0227" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Bromide intoxication in neonates following intake of bromide&#8208;containing medications or being exposed to bromides by the pregnant mothers has been described in another four infants (Finken &amp; Robertson,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0089" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>; Mangurten &amp; Ban,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0164" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Mangurten &amp; Kaye,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0165" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Pleasure &amp; Blackburn,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0214" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). All infants had symptoms of bromism (poor suck, weak cry, diminished Moro reflex, lethargy and hypotonia). Bromide concentrations in the three infants whose mothers took bromide&#8208;containing medication were 3650, 2000 and 2420 mg/L on days 6, 5 and 5, respectively (Finken &amp; Robertson,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0089" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>; Mangurten &amp; Ban,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0164" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Pleasure &amp; Blackburn,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0214" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). The serum concentration 18&#8201;days after birth of the infant of the mother who was occupationally exposed was 150 mg/L (Mangurten &amp; Kaye,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0165" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>).</p><p>Mean bromide concentrations in cord serum of 1267 newborn infants born in Rochester, New York, in 1984 were low: 8.6 mg/L (range: 3.1&#8211;28.5 mg/L) (Miller et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0173" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). None of the mothers had taken bromide&#8208;containing drugs and the concentrations in cord serum were thought to have resulted from occupational exposure to photographic chemicals or from the low levels encountered in food and water. The bromide concentrations in cord serum were not related to indices of fetal health including Apgar scores, neonatal condition or presence of congenital abnormalities (Miller et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0173" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>).</p><p>Bromide is excreted into breast milk. A report from as early as 1938 reviewed this topic and demonstrated the presence of bromide in milk in 10 mothers (Tyson et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0264" ref-type="bibr">1938</xref>). A 1935 report measured milk concentrations of 1666 mg/L in two patients treated with 5 g daily during 1 month (Kwit &amp; Hatcher,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0145" ref-type="bibr">1935</xref>). Rash and sedation of varying degrees in nursing infants have been reported as a result of maternal consumption of bromide during lactation.

These workers were potentially exposed to brominated chemicals, including various organic bromides. As of 31 December 1976, 2806 (79%) of the workers were still living and 578 (16%) had died. For 541 deaths (94%), death certificates could be obtained. Mortality in this cohort was compared with mortality in US white men adjusted for age and calendar time and specific mortality rates were used to calculate expected deaths. Based on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR), more deaths in the cohort were observed for cancer of the digestive system (cancer of the stomach), diseases of the circulatory system and diabetes mellitus. However, overall mortality for the entire cohort and several subgroups was lower than expected. The workers were exposed to several brominated compounds in addition to sodium bromide and potassium bromide, and therefore the mortality from specific causes could not be linked to specific brominated compounds. Finally, no information on potential confounders such as smoking, diet, physical activity, exposure to asbestos or other chemicals, was available and accounted for in the analysis (Wong et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0295" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>).</p><p>Nusair et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0192" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) determined serum bromide concentrations in two populations living in the Dead Sea area and located either close to or far from a bromine factory (a factory extracting liquid bromine from the Dead Sea water): Ghor As&#8208;safi and Deir Alla, respectively, and assessed potential correlation between bromide exposure with genotoxicity and apoptosis in human (Nusair et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0192" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The study used the comet assay to measure DNA damage in peripheral leucocytes (i.e. T%DNA), enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine fortilin level as an apoptosis marker and specific analytical method to measure serum bromide concentration. The serum Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> concentrations were much higher in Ghor As&#8208;safi (16.35&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.40 mg/L; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;197) than in Deir Alla (8.01&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.21 mg/L; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;200), as were the genotoxicity biomarkers. In contrast, serum fortilin did not differ significantly between the two regions (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). T%DNA was strongly and statistically significantly correlated (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.886, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) with serum Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> concentrations. In this study, however, no significant apoptosis levels due to bromide exposure were found (Nusair et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0192" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). No information in the paper is available on (the source of) exposure to bromide, other than serum concentration, or other chemicals and a causal relationship between serum bromide concentration and DNA damage cannot be assumed without taken possible confounders into account. It is possible that bromine release from the factory resulted in bromination disinfection products in water, and therefore the findings of this study cannot be attributed to dietary exposure to bromide.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0054"><label>3.1.4.5</label><title>Human case reports on bromide intake</title><p>Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0021" ref-type="table">B.3</xref>.1 in Appendix&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-app-0002" ref-type="app">B</xref> gives an overview of case reports identified after EFSA's literature search. From these case reports it can be summarised that infants (&#8804;&#8201;12 months) treated with KBr for seizures developed bromoderma or other adverse effects at intakes 495&#8211;720 mg/day resulting in serum bromide concentrations of 890&#8211;1230 mg/L. A similar pattern was seen for older children. Adults experienced adverse health effects at high intakes, such as on the nervous system (drowsiness) and the skin (cutaneous rash), and anorexia but survived intakes of 6.25 g NaBr/day (serum bromide: 12,224 mg/L) or more than 10 g KBr/day (equivalent to 143 mg/kg bw per day). On the other hand, one case report mentioned the occurrence of reversible effects such as drowsiness and myoclonic jerks in all extremities following suicidal administration of 4500 mg of bromovalerylurea (corresponding to 1.6 g of bromide) and subsequent bromide intoxication, with serum bromide concentrations of 81 mg/L (Lin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0151" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, such circulating concentrations of bromide do not appear to be consistent with the amount of bromide acutely ingested, being apparently too low when taking into account the relation between bromide intake and blood concentrations found after controlled dietary bromide administration in humans (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Bromovalerylurea may not release all bromide ions, thus raising some uncertainties about the intake of bromide calculated and whether bromide is responsible for the adverse health effects.</p><p>Psychiatric abnormalities of acute or chronic bromide intoxication include confusion, self&#8208;neglect, fatigue, sluggishness, impairment of memory and concentration, irritability or emotional instability, depression, hallucinations, and schizophrenic&#8208;like psychotic behaviour (Lin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0151" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).

</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of bromide were studied in six mares given a single oral dose of 120 mg KBr/kg bw (corresponding to 80 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw) by stomach tube (Raidal &amp; Edwards,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0218" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Another six mares received a loading dose of 120 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 80 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 3520 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet), by stomach tube for 5&#8201;days, followed by 40 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 26.8 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 1180 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet) in feed for 7&#8201;days. Four mares were used as an untreated control group. A single dose of KBr was well tolerated by all mares, and there was no evidence of adverse effects, such as loss of appetite or neurological deficits. In the second dosing group, each horse remained well throughout the duration of the study and no horse had a reduced appetite. However, during the administration of loading doses, two horses demonstrated mild ataxia and proprioceptive deficits in all four limbs and on neurological examination on days 3 and 4 from the start of dosing. These signs had abated by day 7, 2&#8201;days after commencing the lower &#8216;maintenance&#8217; dose of KBr. However, considering its design and short duration, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for horses.</p><p>Bromide intoxication was reported in a 3&#8208;year&#8208;old thoroughbred filly, that had been administered an unknown dose of oral KBr for behavioural modification over several months (Sacks et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0229" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). The horse presented a several months history of weight loss, polydipsia and polyuria, intermittent diarrhoea and behavioural changes and intermittently uncoordinated gait. Neurological examination revealed hyperexcitability, bilaterally reduced pupillary light reflexes and quadrilateral ataxia with proprioceptive deficits more obvious in the forelimbs than in the hindlimbs. Serum bromide concentration (1.17 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/mL) confirmed bromide intoxication. Clinical signs resolved within 20&#8201;days following the last bromide administration, without specific medical intervention. However, considering that the study reported data for a single animal, and dose and duration of the bromide administration are unknown, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for horses.</p><p>

</p><p>The effects of NaBr on production and health of cattle for fattening were evaluated in 13 Holstein&#8208;Friesian steers and one heifer (body weight: 136&#8211;234 kg), fed a pelleted diet supplemented with NaBr at 170, 511, 1062, 2633 and 4650 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (corresponding to 2.3&#8211;3.3, 6.3&#8211;8.2, 15.6&#8211;19.6, 32.7 and 50.5&#8211;73.6 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, respectively) (Knight &amp; Reina&#8208;Guerra,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0140" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). The five treatments used 2, 3, 4, 3 and 2 cattle, respectively. The duration of the treatment period was 49&#8201;days, followed by a recovery period from day 50 to day 91. Four cattle in total [1 cattle from group 170 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (day 49), 1 cattle from group 2633 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (day 63, culled due to pneumonia) and 2 cattle from group 4650 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (days 49 and 91)] were euthanised and tissues (kidney, liver, muscle) were collected to determine the bromide content. Groups fed the diet containing the highest concentration of bromide (4650 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet) developed signs of motor incoordination after 10&#8211;12&#8201;days of supplementation. The signs of incoordination were observed at serum bromide concentrations of 2400 mg/L<xref rid="efs29121-note-1058" ref-type="fn">

</xref> or more. Serum bromide concentrations and associated neurologic signs subsided markedly 14&#8201;days after feeding of the bromide&#8208;containing feeds was discontinued. However, considering the small number of cattle per treatment (1&#8211;4), the absence of a control group and lack of statistical analysis for the reported data, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for cattle.</p><p>In a study performed to determine the efficacy of KBr as a sedative medical agent in cattle for fattening, 22 Belgian White and Blue double&#8208;muscled male cattle (bw: 241.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.2 kg; age: 7 months) were divided in two groups (11 cattle/treatment, group penned) and fed diets supplemented with KBr at 0 (control) or 736 mg KBr/kg diet DM (corresponding to 495 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet DM, 435 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet and 9.5 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day) (Genicot et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0095" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The duration of the experiment was 221&#8201;days, and the treatment was ended 60&#8201;days before the slaughtering day. The treatment with KBr resulted in a significant reduction in the rear engagements during the whole trial period (221&#8201;days), in direct attacks during the period from day 1 to 53 and in side&#8208;on attacks during the period from day 54 to 167. The daily weight gains were not significantly different between the two groups. Although no statistical analysis was performed, feed utilisation was lower in treated bulls. The time spent for hay intake and the frequency of water intake were reduced and the time during which the bulls were standing was prolonged in the group fed the bromide&#8208;containing diet. However, considering the lack of statistical replicates, the lack of statistical analysis for feed to gain ratio, and the reporting of only behavioural data and body weight gain, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for cattle.</p><p>Another study was conducted to evaluate effects of dietary sodium bromide on bromide transfer to milk and deposition in tissues of dairy cattle (Vreman et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0289" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Nine dairy cows in early lactation were allocated to three treatments (3 cows/treatment, group penned) and fed on a total mixed ration (18.8 kg diet DM/cow per day) supplemented with NaBr at 0, 46.5 and 93.1 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet DM, and, considering the basal dietary bromide content, corresponding to 22 (control), 69 and 115 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet DM (corresponding to 19 (control), 61 and 101 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet and also to 0.7, 2.1 and 3.6 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day). The duration of the experiment/treatment period was 35&#8201;days, followed by a recovery period from day 36 to 56. The initial body weight and milk production of cows, as well as the method of animal distribution to treatments, were not reported. At the start of the study, the milk bromide concentration was 2.8 mg/kg. At the end of the dosing period, two cows of each group were slaughtered, and tissue samples taken to determine bromide. The daily milk production (14.9, 27.5 and 21.8 kg, respectively) and milk bromide concentration (6.1, 17.4 and 30.5 mg/kg, respectively) increased with dietary supplementation of bromide. However, considering the small number of cows used per treatment, the lack of individual feed intake data in the study, as well as of a statistical analysis for feed efficiency, and the poor reporting of the data, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for dairy cows.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Sheep</italic>
</p><p>A pharmacokinetics study of bromide in sheep used eight Merino sheep (49.5&#8211;67.0 kg bw), administered with a single dose of KBr at 178.8 mg/kg bw (corresponding to 120 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw), via an orogastric tube (Quast et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0217" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Sheep did not present any adverse reactions, including neurological signs, or changes in rumen motility and feed and water intake.

<italic toggle="yes">Pigs</italic>
</p><p>The effect of a bromide salt mixture was studied on pig performance (Barber et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>). Large White pigs (initial bw 20 kg, 10&#8201;weeks of age) were used in four treatments, with two replicate pens/treatment and four pigs/pen. The bromide salt mixture, consisting of equal parts of ammonium, potassium and sodium bromides was supplemented to diet at a level of 0 or 200 mg/kg diet (corresponding to 151 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet, and also to 6.5 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day). The bromide salt mixture was added to the basal diet alone or in combination with copper sulfate at 0 or 1000 mg/kg diet (corresponding to 250 mg Cu/kg diet). The experiment lasted until pigs reached 90 kg of body weight. Copper sulfate significantly increased the growth rate and improved feed to gain ratio, whereas the bromide salts had no effect on either of these two variables. However, considering the insufficient number of replicate pens used per treatment, and the reporting of performance data only, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for pigs.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Chicken</italic>
</p><p>The effect of dietary NaBr supplementation on the chick growth was studied in four separate experiments (Bosshardt et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>). The study used 1&#8208; to 3&#8208;day&#8208;old cockerels of various New Hampshire strains, and one to two replicate pens per treatment (15 cockerels/replicate pen) for a 31&#8208;day experimental period. In Experiment 1, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), 8 and 15 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet, or with 10.0 g Trace Element Sea Salt (TESS)/kg diet that provided 15 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet. In Experiments 2 and 3, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), and 15 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet, and in Experiment 4, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), and 8 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet. In all four experiments, feed intake and feed to gain ratio of cockerels were not reported. A significant increase in final body weight was measured in three of four experiments by about 8%&#8211;11% in the bromide&#8208;supplemented groups (average body weight of control animals about 460 g). No other endpoints were reported. It is noted that modern broiler chicken breeds reach that body weight after 14&#8201;days. Considering the small number of replicates used in the study and the lack of reporting feed intake and feed to gain ratio, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for chicken.</p><p>Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of dietary bromide, fluoride and fat levels on the chick growth, using New Hampshire &#215; Delaware broiler chicken, and two to four replicate pens per treatment (5 males and 5 females per pen) for 4&#8208;week experimental periods (days 1&#8211;28 of age) (Doberenz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). In Experiment 1, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), 2500, 5000, 10,000 and 20,000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (corresponding to 0, 333, 682, 1382 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, but no intake could be calculated for the top concentration due to 100% mortality). Performance and mortalities were not affected among treatments up to the dietary level of 5000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet, but the feeding of 10,000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet resulted in a significant decrease in growth rate and the 20,000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet resulted in 100% mortality by 2&#8201;weeks of age. In Experiment 2, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), and 10,000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (corresponding to 0 and 1307 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day), without or with 2000 mg Fl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet. Performance and mortalities were adversely affected in the bromide groups, compared to the control. In Experiment 3, diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control), 5000 and 10,000 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (corresponding to 0, 680 and 1364 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day), without or with 1000 and 2000 mg Fl<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet or fat (at 100 g/kg diet). Performance was adversely affected for both bromide groups, compared to the control. It is noted that, in all three experiments, the body weight of the control broiler chicken was very low (approximately 411&#8211;440 g) when compared to the one the modern breeds reach at day 28 of age (Doberenz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). Any conclusions from this old study could not be extrapolated to current farming conditions, where birds grow at a much faster rate and are expected to be more sensitive to any disturbance. Consequently, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for chicken.</p><p>The iodine (I) toxicity in young chicks and its amelioration by supplemental bromide was studied in four chicken bioassays (Baker et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The research was done with male New Hampshire &#215; Columbian broiler chicken (90 g bw, 8&#8201;days of age) over a 13&#8208;day growth period (days 8&#8211;21 of age), using four treatments, with four replicate pens per treatment and four birds per pen. In two of the assays, the diet was supplemented with NaBr at 0, 50 (assay 1) or 100 (assays 1 and 2) mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (for assay 1 corresponding to 0, 5.1 and 10.1 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, and for assay 2 corresponding to 0, and 10.1 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day), and with KI at 1000 (assay 1) or 1500 (assay 2) mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet. Supplemental iodine levels of 1000&#8211;1500 mg/kg caused severe growth depressions that could be totally reversed by dietary addition of 50 or 100 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet. Performance was not affected among control and bromide treatments. However, considering the short duration of the study, the high dietary iodine supplementation as a confounding factor, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for chicken.</p><p>The effects of bromide in drinking water were studied on the performance of broiler chicken (du Toit &amp; Casey,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The study used mixed Ross broiler chicken over a 42&#8208;day post&#8208;hatch growth period, and six treatments in a 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2 factorial design, with bromide and iodine delivered via drinking water (three levels of bromide as NaBr and two levels of iodine as KI), and three replicate pens per treatment with 30 birds per pen. The six treatments were T1: 0 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L; T2: 1 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L; T3: 3 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L; T4: 0 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0.7 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L; T5: 1 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0.7 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L; and T6: 3 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L and 0.7 mg I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L (corresponding to 0.017, 0.178, 0.502, 0.017, 0.178 and 0.527 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day). Bromide administered at 1 and 3 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L decreased water intake (267.8 vs. 250.2 and 241.9 mL/bird per day) and feed intake (120.3 vs. 116.2 and 113.6 g/bird per day) significantly, for 0, 1 and 3 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L treatments respectively. The interaction of bromide and I had no significant effect on intake of water or feed. Iodine was effective in ameliorating the effect of bromide. Average daily gains, feed to gain ratios and mortalities were not affected among treatments.</p><p>A subsequent companion publication (du Toit &amp; Casey,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported additional data on blood and tissues of chicken. At days 16 and 42, blood samples were taken from five birds of each replicate. The thyroid, liver and kidneys from two chicken per replicate pen were collected for analysis and histopathology (only the 2 groups with high bromide supplementation). The effect of bromide on T3 and T4 levels overall was non&#8208;significant, but T3 and T4 levels decreased between weeks 4 and 6 with a significant effect at week 6 on T3. Bromide in water for drinking resulted in a dose&#8208;dependent increase of bromide residues in the three organs analysed with lower levels in the groups with added I. The I residue was not influenced by iodine or bromide in water for drinking. Bromide residues were highest in the kidneys, followed by liver and thyroid gland. Histopathological assessment showed explicit damage to the livers that received the bromide treatments. Hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolar degeneration due to swelling of the intracytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum were observed to be more severe in groups without added I. Both publications by du Toit and Casey&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported results from the same study. In principle, only the treatments without added I should be used to examine possible adverse effects of Br. The replication (3 replicate pens/treatment) is rather limited, and the main shortcoming is that, due to rather confusing reporting, it is not possible to know certainly which was the level of exposure of the birds to bromide in each treated group. This limitation makes the study unsuitable to establish a reference point for chicken.</p><p>A study was conducted to determine the quality and safety of eggs obtained from laying hens after their experimental poisoning with NaBr, for 28&#8201;days, followed by a 14&#8208;day period of birds' recovery period (Kutsan et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0144" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Sixty Hisex White cross laying hens (365&#8201;days of age, body weight: 1.4 kg) were allocated to four dietary treatments (15 hens/treatment, group penned), and supplemented with NaBr at 0 (control) or 10, 50 and 250 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet (corresponding to 0, 0.6, 3.0 and 15.0 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day). The background bromine content of the compound feed was 2.0 mg/kg. Egg production and quality was determined, and the bromine content was determined separately in egg white, yolk and shell. Clinical manifestations of poisoning in hens were not observed. No significant deviation from the control group was observed in productivity, egg mass, white to yolk mass ratios and pH values of yolk and white. However, considering the low number of replicate pens used per treatment, the lack of reporting of laying rate, feed intake and feed to egg mass ratio, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference value for chicken.</p><p>Another study was conducted to determine chicken embryo sensitivity to a range of bromide treatments (Lucht et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0155" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A NaBr solution was injected into Ross&#8208;308 eggs in three phases: (1) five eggs injected with 0.002 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/egg; (2) 45 eggs divided into groups and injected with 0, 0.0002 and 0.001 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/egg; (3) 148 eggs divided into groups injected with 0, 0.000002, 0.00001, 0.0001, and 0.0002 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/egg. The mass of the embryo and of the heart, liver and brain was measured at day 20.

Concentrations &gt;&#8201;0.0001 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/egg showed greater risk on differential development. Concentrations &gt;&#8201;0.000002 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/egg showed potentially severe effects on developing embryos. The heart showed the greatest relative growth response followed by the brain.

Adult mongrel dogs of both sexes (4&#8211;8 dogs per group) were used in six treatments, with a duration of 4&#8211;26&#8201;weeks, depending on the dose. Dogs received NaBr, in capsules wrapped in dog food balls, at doses of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg NaBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 78, 156, 234, 312, 390 and 468 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 4038, 8076, 12,114, 16,152, 20,190 and 24,228 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet). Bromide intoxication included signs of neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and toxicity to the skin. Dogs given 78 mg/kg bw per day experimentally for 6&#8201;weeks had minimal adverse effects (i.e. emaciation and weight loss of 15%), whereas those given the drug at dosages of 156 to 390 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day for 4&#8211;26&#8201;weeks developed shivering, ataxia, skin lesions, salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, haematochezia, stupor, emaciation and weight loss, coma, and in some cases, death. In a follow&#8208;up publication, Rosenblum and Hawkins Jr.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0225" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>) reported for the same experimental animals a decrease in the volume of the extracellular space and haemoconcentration, and/or anaemia and leucocytosis, during the bromide intoxication of dogs.</p><p>In another publication, Rosenblum et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0226" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>) studied the chronic effects of inorganic bromide in dogs. Beagle dogs (initial body weight: 5.4&#8211;6.1 kg, 6&#8211;12&#8201;weeks of age) were used as the controls (3 males and 3 females) and the treated group (3 males and 1 female). Dogs received NaBr, in capsules wrapped in meat balls, at doses of 0 and 128 mg NaBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 0 and 100 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, and to 0 and 5176 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet), for 12 months. Body weight and feed intake were similar between the two groups. Occasional salivation and diarrhoea were noted in the treated group. No significant effects were noted in the dogs on haemoglobin, haematocrit, white and red cell counts, serum proteins or blood urea nitrogen. One dog died during the course of the experiment in the treated group, but pneumonia was diagnosed as the cause of death. Histological examination of the various organs (brain, lung, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, testes, adrenals and thyroids) gave predominantly normal results, and there were no changes that could be attributed to bromide intoxication.</p><p>Bromide secretion by the canine prostate was studied, using four dogs (11&#8211;14 kg bw) with surgically produced prostatic fistulas that were given single oral doses of 1130 mg NaBr/day (corresponding to 881 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/day and 70.5 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 3650 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet), for five consecutive days (Smith &amp; Ilievski,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0241" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). The bromide secreted in prostatic fluid, given that it may impair sperm motility in&#160;vitro, potentially could adversely affect reproduction. However, considering the lack of a control group and the single dose used, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for dogs.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of KBr in dogs was studied, using six healthy adult Beagle dogs (3 males and 3 females, mean body weight: 11.3 kg) (March et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0166" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Dogs received KBr, with canned food, at 60 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 40 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and to 2070 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet), for a period of 115&#8201;days. The study lacked an untreated control group. High&#8208;dose KBr administration was well tolerated and resulted in minimal adverse side effects. Dogs showed minimal to no neurologic signs during all phases of the study. At the highest serum bromide concentrations of approximately 400 mg/dL, two dogs exhibited mild to moderate caudal paresis and ataxia.</p><p>A placebo&#8208;controlled experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of potassium bromide on the canine thyroid gland (Paull et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0199" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The trial was conducted with 10 adult, sexually intact, hound dogs (1&#8211;2&#8201;years of age) and used two treatment groups (2 male and 3 female dogs/treatment), a group of dogs treated with KBr, and another one which remained untreated. Dogs were assigned such that baseline tT4, TSH and sex were comparable between control and experimental groups. Treated dogs received a loading dose of KBr at 200 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 134 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day) for 2&#8201;days, and this was followed by a maintenance dose of KBr at 30 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 20 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and to approximately 1035 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet) for 180&#8201;days. The five control dogs received an equivalent loading dose volume of distilled water for 2&#8201;days, followed by an equivalent maintenance dose volume for 180&#8201;days. Potassium bromide, or distilled water, was administered daily in a treat (&#8216;meatball&#8217; of white bread) with canine maintenance diet. Basal tT4, fT4 and basal TSH serum concentrations were evaluated over the 6&#8208;month period in potassium bromide&#8208;treated and control dogs. A TRH&#8208;releasing hormone stimulation test was also performed in all dogs at the beginning and conclusion of the study. Thyroid histopathology was compared between treated and control dogs at the end of the study. No difference was detected in any parameter between the two groups at the end of the study. A decline in thyroid hormone concentrations over the course of the study did occur in both groups of dogs. KBr did not appear to have a significant effect on canine thyroid function or morphology. Administration of KBr did not affect the canine thyroid function or morphology. From the study of Paull et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0199" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), the value of 1035 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet or 20 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day can be considered as the NOAEL of dogs for effects on the thyroid (Paull et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0199" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>Piperisova et&#160;al.

The dog presented a progressive paresis, a marked hyperchloraemia and a decreased anion gap on blood electrolyte analysis, accompanied with elevated serum bromide concentration (400 mg/dL). However, considering the reporting of data in only one dog and the short duration of the study, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for dogs.</p><p>A case of bromide toxicity in a castrated male Shetland sheepdog (9&#8208;years old) was reported (McConkey et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0170" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), following a fivefold compounding error in the concentration of potassium bromide. The dog had been treated with KBr and phenobarbital for idiopathic epilepsy for 6&#8201;years prior to presentation for the compounding error. The dog was receiving a KBr solution at 27 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 18 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 935 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet) and 8 mg phenobarbital/kg bw per day, at the time of the compounding error. Five days after the owner renewed the KBr prescription at a local pharmacy, the dog fell down the stairs and appeared to have a subdued demeanour, sore neck and delayed proprioception in both forelimbs. Within a few days, his signs progressed to depression, inability to walk, mild abdominal discomfort and bradycardia (heart rate 60 beats/min). Bromine toxicity was attributed to compounding error during the refilling of the KBr prescription at the local pharmacy, as, after a sample of the compounded drug was sent to Diagnostic Services, the KBr concentration in the solution was found to be 225 mg/mL (corresponding to 90 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day and also to 4675 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg diet), instead of the 200 mg/5 mL that had been prescribed and written on the label. However, considering the reporting of data in only one dog (case report), the short duration of the study, the uncertainty on the dose level (a mistake), and administration together with phenobarbital, the Scientific Committee could not use this study to establish a reference point for dogs.</p><p>

</p><p>Ruminants are an important source of methane emitted to the atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that the inclusion of certain microalgae in the diets of ruminants can result in a reduction of methane emissions by ruminants (Abbott et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Such use could lead to increases in bromide exposure to food producing animals. The effects of dietary supplementation of the microalga <italic toggle="yes">Asparagopsis taxiformis</italic> (AT) and oregano leaves were studied on methane emission, rumen fermentation and lactational performance of dairy cows (Stefenoni et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0245" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). A total of 20 Holstein cows (2.6 lactations, 95&#8201;days in milk, 42.2 kg of milk yield/day) were used in a replicated 4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4 Latin square design with four 28&#8208;days periods (21&#8201;days for adaptation and 7&#8201;days for data and samples collection), with four dietary treatments. Basal diet was supplemented with 0 (control), 2.5 g AT (LowAT), 5.0 g AT (HighAT) or 17.7 g oregano (<italic toggle="yes">Origanum vulgare</italic> L.) leaves/kg diet DM. The study lacks reporting of the bromide content of the microalga <italic toggle="yes">A. taxiformis</italic> or of the diets. HighAT decreased average daily CH<sub>4</sub> emission and CH<sub>4</sub> yield by 65% and 55%, respectively, in the first two 28&#8208;days periods, but had no effect in the last two 28&#8208;days periods. The differential response to AT among experimental periods was likely a result of a decrease in CHBr<sub>3</sub> concentration in AT over time. Compared with the control, HighAT decreased DM intake, milk yield and energy corrected milk yield. Milk composition was not affected by treatment, except lactose percentage and yield were decreased by HighAT. Concentrations of bromide and iodine in milk were increased by HighAT compared with the control (5.1 vs. 40.4 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg milk, 8 times higher, and 575 vs. 2966 ng I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/mL (&#956;g I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L) milk, 5 times higher, respectively). Both bromide and iodine concentrations were lower (by 27% and 20%%, respectively) in milk from the last two 28&#8208;days periods than in milk from the first two 28&#8208;days periods. Milk CHBr<sub>3</sub> concentration and its organoleptic characteristics were not different between control and HighAT.</p><p>The effects of dietary supplementation of microalga <italic toggle="yes">Asparagopsis taxiformis</italic> (AT) were determined on milk production and quality, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) production and rumen microbiome of dairy cows (Krizsan et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0143" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).

Daily CH<sub>4</sub> production, CH<sub>4</sub> yield and CH<sub>4</sub> intensity decreased by 60%, 54% and 58%, respectively, in cows fed the diet supplemented with AT. Furthermore, hydrogen gas emitted by cows fed diets supplemented with AT increased by more than five times compared with cows fed a non&#8208;AT&#8208;supplemented diet. Feed intake was decreased and milk production altered, reflecting a decreased yield of milk fat in cows fed an AT&#8208;supplemented diet, but feed efficiency increased. The most prominent change in milk quality was an increase in bromine (5.1 vs. 43.2 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L milk, more than a 8&#8208;fold increase) and iodine (139 vs. 2105 &#956;g I<sup>&#8722;</sup>/L milk, more than a 15&#8208;fold increase) when the diet was supplemented with AT.</p><p>

Their findings suggested that bromide strongly inhibited the oxidation of iodide to iodine by hydrogen peroxide and, to a lesser degree, inhibited iodinated tyrosine residue coupling to thyronine. Buchberger et&#160;al. showed that bromide can also replace iodide on TPO active site such that bromination reactions take place, with formation of bromo/iodo&#8208;substituted thyronines in the gland (Buchberger,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Buchberger et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>).

Interestingly, some experiments suggested that, in bromide&#8208;treated rats, the pituitary gland functions at its maximum capacity and cannot compensate for a further decrease in serum tT4, with an additional increase in release of TSH.

<italic toggle="yes">Summary on AOPs for thyroid&#8208;mediated effects</italic>
</p><p>In summary, there is evidence that bromide alters thyroid hormone homeostasis (i.e. disrupts the HPT axis) in the rat. A decrease of serum T4 concentration, a critical effect with clear dose dependency, appears to be the most sensitive endpoint of bromide in the rat (see Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A plausible MOA appears to involve competitive inhibition of iodide uptake, via the NIS, a direct mechanism of action (followed by decreased thyroid hormone synthesis (KE) and associated increase in TSH (KE)). NIS inhibition is a MIE in AOP 54 and 134 leading to neurodevelopmental adverse outcomes (AO), indicating a potential impact of bromide exposure on neurodevelopment. Decreased serum T4 concentration is a key event in AOP 42 and 54. TSH is the relevant parameter that indicates compensatory response of the HPT feedback loop.</p><p>According to the AOPs, the observed plasma decreases in thyroid hormone activate the feedback mechanism of the HPT axis, resulting in TRH release from the hypothalamus which in turn stimulates hypophyseal TSH release (KE). Sustained thyroid stimulation by TSH in response to reduced thyroid hormone levels may result in hypertrophy of thyroid follicles (increases size of follicles), which further result in thyroid hyperplasia (increased number of follicles), accompanied by colloid depletion with granular appearance, and increase in the colloid vacuolation in thyroid glands. Altered circulating levels of T3 and T4 without histopathological finding may still present sufficient evidence for a potential concern for neurodevelopment (EFSA&#8208;ECHA et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and decreased serum T4 is considered as a biomarker of effect for neurodevelopment as an adverse outcome.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0062"><label>3.1.6.3</label><title>Species and sex differences of thyroid endpoints</title><p>

</p><p>Dogs appeared less sensitive to thyroid effects of bromide (Paull et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0199" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and overall, to thyroid disruptive chemicals when compared to rats. The young adult rat is considered a sensitive species, and several substances disrupt the HPT axis in this species. This is mainly due to the faster decline of the hormone reservoir in rats, which occurs within days compared to the more stable reservoir in humans. The half&#8208;lives of T3 and T4 in rats are 6 h and 12&#8211;24 h, respectively, compared to half&#8208;lives of 1 and 7&#8201;days, respectively, in humans. As a result, the homeostatic upregulation of TSH and related changes are more immediate in the rat and serve as sensitive indicators of a disturbance. In addition, there are species differences in thyroid hormone binding proteins, where thyroid binding globulin (TBG) is the main transporter in humans whereas transthyretin (TTR; a.k.a. prealbumin) is the predominant protein in rats (and a secondary binding and transport protein in humans). TBG acts also as a reservoir for thyroid hormone, due to its high affinity for the thyroid hormone. Only the free hormones (about 0.3% or even less for T3) are biologically active at the tissue and cellular level (Bartsch et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Foster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0091" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In humans, about 75% of T4 is bound to TBG, 20% to transthyretin (TTR) and 5% to albumin while in the young adult rat, TTR is the predominant serum&#8208;binding protein where 75% of the T4 is bound to TTR and 25% to albumin.</p><p>However, in the neonatal rat, T4 is primarily bound to TBG as in humans, and thus although this species&#8208;difference is often highlighted, it is based only on data from adult animals.</p><p>In young adult rats, a 10&#8208;fold higher tT4 supplementation (20 mg/kg bw) is needed to maintain health in the absence of a functional thyroid compared to humans (2.2 mg/kg bw) (Capen,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The tT4 half&#8208;life is significantly shorter in young adult rodents (12&#8211;24 h in rat, 12&#8211;18 h in mouse) compared to humans (5&#8211;9&#8201;days) due to higher reserves of thyroid hormone in humans in the form of TBG which is essentially absent in the young adult rodents. This, however, is not the case in the developing rodent where TBG also functions as a transport protein (Dohler et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). In contrast, TBG in humans, monkeys and dogs, has a 1000&#8208;fold higher affinity for T4 compared to TTR. These differences result in thyroid hormone kinetic differences, higher turnover, higher clearance rates with higher rate of thyroid hormone production, smaller reserve capacity of thyroid hormones in adult rodents compared to humans and by extension higher basal TSH level, a more active thyroid gland and consequently higher sensitivity of rodents to thyroid hormone inhibition compared to humans (Bartsch et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Lewandowski et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0150" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; McClain et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0169" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Distinct histological differences of the thyroid gland are observed between rats and other species, including humans and non&#8208;human primates (McClain,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0168" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). In rodents, unlike humans, the follicles have a tall cuboidal epithelium lining, contain smaller amounts of thyroglobulin colloid and have higher hormone synthesis and secretion activity (Suttie et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0253" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The quantitative morphological and physiological differences observed in rat support a faster rate of thyroid hormone synthesis and turnover in response to perturbations compared to humans (U.S. EPA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0265" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the low level of TBG, mice appear less sensitive than rats (Kato et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0132" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) to the impact of T3 glucuronidation on decreased serum T4, increased serum TSH and proliferation of follicular cells (Hood et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0118" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Klaassen &amp; Hood,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0137" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Furthermore, rats and mice showed a different pattern of T4 and T3 binding proteins in blood with a greater binding of thyroid hormone to prealbumin in rats (transthyretin) and to postalbumin in mice (Capen,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Capen,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>Species differences have been demonstrated in&#160;vitro for NIS activity, with rat NIS being more efficient/effective in I&#8208;uptake than human NIS (Dayem et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Heltemes et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0114" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).

In addition, the binding capacity of TTR for thyroid hormones in female rats is lower than in male rats due to oestrogen binding (Emerson et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0084" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0063"><label>3.1.6.4</label><title>Modes of action related to neurotoxicity</title><p>There is limited information on possible MOAs of bromide other than those mediated via the thyroid.</p><p>Bromide is thought to exert its antiepileptic activity by passing through neuronal chloride ion channels associated with &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, which hyperpolarises neuronal membranes, leading to the seizure threshold being raised, and neurons stabilised against excitatory input. Due to the smaller size of the hydrated bromide, it can passively cross these neuronal channels more readily than chloride ions. As a result, bromides are distributed into the CSF and interstitial tissues of the brain.

Bromide and GABA induced the same dendritic changes in the principal ganglion cells of the superior cervical ganglion of adult rats (Jo&#243; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0131" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Wolff et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0294" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>). In cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells both sodium bromide and GABA induced plastic changes affecting the shape of the dendrites with non&#8208;innervated or free postsynaptic thickenings and desmosome&#8208;like contact between dendrites and morphological changes suggestive of maturation of presynaptic elements and primitive stages of synaptogenesis (Eins et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0081" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Spoerri,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0243" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Spoerri &amp; Wolff,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0244" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>).</p><p>In a study in which foreign nerves were implanted into the superior cervical ganglion of adult rats, prior administration of 2800 mg/L sodium bromide in drinking water for 12&#8201;days (equivalent to about 260 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day) promoted synaptogenesis analogous to GABA (Toldi et&#160;al., <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0905" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). When rats were given 2.16 mg Br&#8722;/L sodium bromide in drinking water for periods of time from 1 day to 1 month (equivalent to about 200 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day), there was no effect on GABA binding, uptake, metabolism or tissue concentration (Balcar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>).</p><p>Bromide decreased acetylcholine release from rat presynaptic cells in&#160;vitro in a manner independent of the GABA receptors. In&#160;vivo, perfusion of the exposed superior cervical ganglion of the anaesthetised rat depressed the amplitude of the potentials evoked by preganglionic nerve stimulation in the superior cervical ganglion of the rat (K&#225;sa et&#160;al., <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0906" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). However, the relevance of these data is open to question since the studies were conducted at a relatively high concentration of NaBr (1&#8201;mM).</p><p>In conclusion, bromide seems to have similar actions to GABA, but there is little information on the mechanisms of bromide neurotoxicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0064"><label>3.1.7</label><title>Consideration of critical effects and reference values</title><sec id="efs29121-sec-0065"><label>3.1.7.1</label><title>Establishment of reference values for human health</title><sec id="efs29121-sec-0066"><label>3.1.7.1.1</label><title>Critical effects</title><p>As described above (Section&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-sec-0040" ref-type="sec">3.1.3</xref>), studies in experimental animals (mainly rats) have shown that bromide has effects on the thyroid and other endocrine organs, CNS, kidneys, reproductive system and on growth (body weight gain) and fetal development. The effects seen at the lowest doses involve the thyroid and CNS. Reports of neurotoxicity were generally related to clinical signs, such as abnormal gait, at doses in excess of 100 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. It is possible that more subtle effects could occur at lower doses, but there are no data available to assess this. Similarly, effects on reproduction and development have generally been reported at doses in excess of 100 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day (Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>A large number of studies have reported adverse effects of bromide on levels of thyroid hormones (particularly tT4) or on morphology of the thyroid gland, but the dose response is not well defined. Most of the studies published in the scientific literature were performed in a small number of laboratories and were not compliant with OECD guidelines. However, the overall weight of evidence supports the activation of the HPT axis following oral exposure to bromide.</p><p>Studies performed with administration of bromide salts in the diet for 4&#8211;13&#8201;weeks have shown dose&#8208;related increases in thyroid weight, decreased serum levels of tT4 and increased TSH generally at doses of 84 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day or higher, with no reported effects at tested doses of 1&#8211;21 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day for 2&#8211;13&#8201;weeks (van Leeuwen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0274" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Loeber et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0153" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; van Logten et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0276" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). One study (van Leeuwen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0273" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>) noted a dose&#8208;dependent decrease in serum tT4 in males after 6&#8201;weeks starting from the lowest dose, equivalent to 5 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. A significant decrease was also seen in female rats at higher doses, starting from 337 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. However, the authors noted that other studies from their laboratory (Loeber et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0153" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) had not confirmed effects on thyroid hormones at the low doses seen in males in this study after 13&#8201;weeks.</p><p>The majority of the studies were conducted with administration of bromide salts in the drinking water for varying periods of time.

In contrast, Velicky and colleagues (Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Duskov&#225;, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0280" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Velick&#253;, Titlbach, Lojda, et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0283" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) administered lower concentrations in drinking water and found significantly decreased serum tT4 and morphological changes in the thyroid at administered doses as low as around 1 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day. This observation was cast into doubt by poor reporting and lack of biological significance and by a subsequent study (Velick&#253; et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0282" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) which reported no marked effect on serum tT4 levels at doses of 9&#8211;36 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day.</p><p>Thus, there is consistency in the observations relating to effects on the thyroid but not in the doses at which these are observed.

</xref> and have a minor impact on the total dose in the toxicological studies.</p><p>Mode of action studies suggested that bromide competitively inhibits iodide uptake into the thyroid, via the NIS, which leads to decreased thyroid hormone synthesis and associated increase in hypophyseal TSH. Sustained thyroid stimulation by TSH as compensatory response to reduced thyroid hormone levels may result in hypertrophy of thyroid follicles, thyroid hyperplasia, accompanied by colloid depletion and increased peripheral colloid vacuolation in thyroid glands. Changes in thyroid hormone levels, depending on magnitude, the windows of exposure and time length, present a potential concern for adults and for pre&#8208; and post&#8208;natal neurological development (EFSA&#8208;ECHA et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). According to the guidance, changes in thyroid hormone levels in the rats are considered a sensitive indicator of the potential of chemical compounds for thyroid disruption and a concern for the developing brain.</p><p>The Scientific Committee also reviewed the human observations related to bromide exposure. The case studies provided evidence of adverse effects on the CNS, skin and GI tract, but did not provide adequate information on dose&#8211;response. The observational studies were insufficient to indicate specific associations.</p><p>A few experimental studies in healthy volunteers were available with oral administration of NaBr by capsule for up to 12&#8201;weeks. The studies by Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0233" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>), Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) and Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0231" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>)/ van Gelderen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0270" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) examining the effect of bromide on endocrinological parameters, indicated a NOAEL of 4 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day for women. At 9 mg/kg bw per day, there was a statistically significant increase in serum tT4 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), fT4 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) and tT3 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) at the end of the intervention compared to concentrations at the start of the study of Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>), whereas an increase in TSH but no change in T4 was reported in Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0231" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>)/van Gelderen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0270" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). In addition, the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked cerebral activity of each subject showed a decrease in &#948;1&#8208; and &#948;2&#8208;activities and increases in &#946;&#8208;activities and in mean frequency (Mobility parameter) at the end compared to the start of the study (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Overall, these studies provide evidence of effects of bromide on the CNS and on thyroid hormones at supplemental exposures of 9 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day in females. The Scientific Committee noted that there was no explanation for the increase in mean tT4 concentration in one of these studies, which was not replicated in another, but that the increase in mean TSH concentration is indicative of effects on the HPT axis.</p><p>There is no information on health effects of bromide for children, adults &gt;&#8201;31&#8201;years, pregnant or lactating women, or after long&#8208;term intake.</p><p>An intake of 4 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day, above intake of bromide that is naturally present in the diet (8&#8211;9 mg/day, i.e. about 0.1 mg/kg bw per day for a 70&#8208;kg adult), resulted in plasma bromide concentrations of 244 and 258 mg/L for females in two studies (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0231" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; van Gelderen et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0270" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), and 171 mg/L for males (Sangster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). The background intake from the diet is minimal compared to the doses administered in these studies, and therefore, the NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw per day does not require adjustment to total intake.</p><p>Therefore, the Scientific Committee concludes that altered thyroid hormone concentrations is an early critical effect of bromide and that the human data do not provide a suitable basis for identification of a reference point. Most studies in rats had reported on serum tT4 concentrations, although there was inconsistency between the dose levels at which changes occur. By developing a reference dose based on the critical effect of decreased serum tT4, it is expected that all subsequent potential adverse effects will be prevented. Therefore, benchmark dose modelling was performed on the tT4 data from the more reliable studies in order to provide a potential reference point.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0067"><label>3.1.7.1.2</label><title>Dose response modelling</title><p>The Scientific Committee performed benchmark dose (BMD) modelling according to the 2022 EFSA Guidance on the use of the BMD approach in risk assessment (see Section&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-sec-0031" ref-type="sec">2.6</xref>) (EFSA Scientific Committee,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>The results of the BMD modelling for the critical studies identified above on disturbance of thyroid homeostasis in rats after oral exposure to bromide are summarised in Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0007" ref-type="table">7</xref>.

<italic toggle="yes">Selection of the BMR</italic>
</p><p>The EFSA guidance on BMD (2022) recommends that the BMR should reflect the onset of a human&#8208;relevant adverse effect, meaning that a response above the BMR is considered adverse. In rats, a 10%&#8211;17% decrease in T4 during pregnancy and lactation is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in rat offspring (Gilbert,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0097" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gilbert et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0099" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Heterotropia, an abnormal cluster of neurons within the normal neurons, sparse white matter of the corpus callosum have been observed in fetuses of dams with serum T4 decrements of approximately 20% (Hassan et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0111" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In humans, a 25% decrease in T4 (either tT4 or fT4) during pregnancy (during second trimester) results in neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits in children (Haddow et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0104" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the Scientific Committee selected a BMR of 20% for blood tT4 level decrease.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">BMD analysis</italic>
</p><p>BMD modelling was performed on animal studies reporting blood tT4 level changes after oral exposure to bromide (sub&#8208;chronic), including at least three doses and a control group (cf. part 3.1.3.5, Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

BMD modelling is done using exposure time as a covariate. BMD analysis of tT4 levels after 12&#8201;weeks is not considered relevant as the 90% credible interval is too wide (BMDU/BMDL &gt;&#8201;100).</p><p>van Leeuwen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0271" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) measured serum tT4 levels of male and female rats exposed to bromide for 6&#8201;weeks.

The Scientific Committee noted that the lowest of these values was for female rats in a study in which the BMDL<sub>20</sub> for male rats was 51.6 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day (Study Report,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0252" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). In contrast, modelling of the data of Van Leeuwen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0271" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) resulted in higher BMD<sub>20</sub> and BMDL<sub>20</sub> values for female rats than for males. Furthermore, male rats are generally found to be more sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone levels than female rats (Foster et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0091" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Kieffer et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0135" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>). The greater sensitivity of the males was also apparent in the 2016b study in which serum tT3 was decreased only in males but not females. Taking into account also the higher uncertainty in the BMD analysis of the females in the 2016b study (BMDU/BMDL ratio of 12.8 in females compared to 2.8 in males), the Scientific Committee concluded that the BMDL<sub>20</sub> of females of 13 mg/kg bw per day was not a robust reference point and identified the BMDL<sub>20</sub> of 40 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day as the reference point (RP).</p><p>The Scientific Committee established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.4 mg/kg bw for bromide by applying an UF of 100 to the RP of 40 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day to allow for inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;species differences. In principle, a lower UF might be proposed because humans are considered to be no more sensitive than rats to effects on the thyroid (EFSA&#8208;ECHA et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), suggesting that the default factor of 2.5 for inter&#8208;species variability in toxicodynamics (EFSA Scientific Committee,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0076" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) is not required and an overall uncertainty factor of 40 would be sufficiently protective for human health. The reproductive and developmental studies that have been performed with bromide give conflicting reports regarding the sensitivity of the offspring. Van Leeuwen et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0271" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) reported effects on the parental generation at doses not associated with changes in thyroid hormones in the pups, whereas Pavelka et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0204" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), Pavelka&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0203" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>) reported that effects on thyroid hormones were more pronounced in pups. However, these studies did not assess the range of endpoints that would be expected in neurodevelopmental studies and the studies of Pavelka et&#160;al. were judged to be of low reliability. The Scientific Committee noted the additional uncertainty with respect to the possibility of neurodevelopmental effects in neonates and followed an EKE process to determine the size of uncertainty factor required to allow for these uncertainties (see Section&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-sec-0086" ref-type="sec">3.9</xref>). By expert group judgement, a factor of 2.5 was considered sufficient to allow for all additional uncertainties. Therefore, an overall uncertainty factor of 100 was applied.</p><p>This TDI is supported by the NOAEL of 4 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day from the study in humans of Sangster et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0232" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) including an uncertainty factor of 10 for inter&#8208;individual variability.</p><p>From the case reports it can be summarised that infants (&#8804;&#8201;12 months) treated with KBr had intakes of 495&#8211;720 mg/day resulting in serum bromide concentrations of 890&#8211;1230 mg/L. A similar pattern was seen for older children. Case reports for adults reported serum bromide concentrations from 407.5 to 3520 mg/L. These serum bromide concentrations are all considerably higher than those estimated to result from the TDI.</p><p>Overall, and based on a comprehensive assessment of the literature and assessment of serum bromide levels in the case reports, a TDI of 0.4 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw is considered to be sufficiently protective for the general human population, including the offspring of pregnant and lactating women.</p><p>The Scientific Committee also considered whether there is a need for establishment of an acute reference dose (ARfD). Bromide is of low acute toxicity in rodents, and effects other than on thyroid hormones (e.g. neurological, gastrointestinal or skin reactions) are observed following repeated exposure to doses of 100 mg/kg bw per day and higher. With respect to effects on thyroid hormones, for adult humans, a decrease in tT4 is not an apical endpoint and hypothyroxaemia will not generally cause an immediate clinical manifestation because of the hormone functional reserve (most of T4 is protein bound) and because of the feedback mechanism on the pituitary axis (the level of serum TSH increases due to TRH stimulation).</p><p>However, if the thyroid hormone deficiency occurs early in pregnancy, the offspring may suffer from visual attention deficits, visual processing and gross motor skills. If it occurs later in pregnancy, children are at additional risk of subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, as well as slower response speeds and fine motor deficits (Zoeller &amp; Rovet,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0300" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The most sensitive window for thyroid hormone disturbance is the first trimester of pregnancy during which neuron proliferation, migration and differentiation occur (e.g. the GABA switch). Even modest degrees of thyroid hormone disruption experienced in utero can result in neuropsychological deficits in children despite normal thyroid status at birth (U.S. EPA,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0266" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Finken et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0088" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Haddow et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0104" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Korevaar et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0141" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Pop et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0216" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0215" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In rats, a 20% reduction in maternal serum T4 is associated with a 35% reduction in fetal serum T4 (Hassan et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0111" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, the Scientific Committee concluded that there is a need for an ARfD to protect against neurodevelopmental effects arising from short&#8208;term elevated exposure to bromide that results in &gt;&#8201;20% reduction in maternal serum T4 at a critical stage in pregnancy. In the absence of short&#8208;term studies assessing the effects of bromide on thyroid hormones to provide a Reference Point as a basis for the ARfD, the Scientific Committee considered that the TDI should also be applied as an ARfD.

Widely used feed databases in Europe or the USA do not list bromide as a constituent, and where concentrations have been reported, these have frequently been in feeds which have been fumigated with methyl bromide or grown on soils to which methyl bromide has been applied as a soil fumigant.

Of these, 84% had bromide concentrations of &lt;&#8201;100 mg/kg, but the authors concluded that for many of these samples, and particularly for those with higher concentrations, methyl bromide had been used as a fumigant prior to importation.</p><p>Underwood&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0268" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>) cited several publications in which the bromide contents up to 25 mg Br&#8722;/kg in non&#8208;forage feeds (whole cereal grains) had been reported and where no fumigant had been used. For green forages, bromide concentrations were generally lower (up to 11 mg/kg DM), although in one report concentrations of up to 8400 mg/kg were found in grass hay which had been cut from a field previously treated with methyl bromide (Knight and Costner, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-7140" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>).

It is stable and not subject to degradation. It can therefore be assumed to migrate from food when it is cooked in water, assuming that the concentration in the food is greater than in the water that is used for cooking. If water is lost from food as it is cooked or processed, then it can be assumed that bromide will be lost with that water, but if fats or oils are lost during cooking or processing, then the bromide may remain in the food and hence the concentration could increase.</p><p>Cunningham and Warner investigated bromine concentration as an indication of pre&#8208;baking bromation of bread products, related to the use (in some parts of the world) of potassium bromate as a strong oxidiser that is commonly used in the production of bread products as a flour maturing and dough conditioning agent to strengthen the gluten of strong or high&#8208;protein flour (Cunningham &amp; Warner,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The bromate reduces to bromide in the final products because of the reductive properties of bread dough. Reduction begins when ingredients are mixed and continues during baking. As a result, when potassium bromate is used, the amount of bromide is elevated in bread products. Bromate is typically added at concentrations equivalent to 10&#8211;36 mg/kg bromide and this will typically be converted to similar concentrations of bromide in the cooking process. Similar results were reported by Osborne et&#160;al.

This involved the comparison of the (theoretical) maximum daily intake estimates based on the MRLs for bromide to the TDI and ARfD established for bromide in this opinion. This approach assumes that all commodities contain residues at the MRL which is not expected to occur in practice.

<italic toggle="yes">Uncertainty of hazard assessment</italic>
</p><p>The purpose of the analysis was to assess the overall uncertainty of the TDI for human health.</p><p>The calculation of the TDI is based on a selected reference point of 40 mg Br&#8722;/kg bw per day and application of standard extrapolation factors of 10 for intra&#8208;species extrapolation, and four for inter&#8208;species differences in toxicokinetics, which are not subject to further uncertainty analysis. An additional factor of 2.5 was proposed to account for residual uncertainties due to limitations in the body of evidence. Hence, the EKE session was refocused on assessing additional uncertainties in the body of evidence.</p><p>The EKE group concluded that (a) although there is uncertainty about the sensitivity of the fetus to plasma tT4 decreases, the maternal adaptive response to small changes in T4 (up to 20%) is expected to maintain thyroid homeostasis and not impact the functional T3 levels in the brain of the fetus; (b) since measurements of hormones were made in adult animals, the LOD is not a limitation. In addition, the variability of the assays leads to a lower BMDL, which compensates for uncertainties in the impact that the effect level (20%) may have on fetal brain T3 (BMDL more protective). Overall, there is larger uncertainty in the body of evidence suggesting that the true reference point is more likely to be lower than 40 mg/kg bw per day. It is less likely that the reference point is higher than 40 mg/kg bw per day.</p><p>The EKE group estimated that the plausible range of the multiplicative factor of the reference point due to the uncertainty in the evidence base was 0.56&#8211;1.72 (with 90% certainty, the reference point may be 0.56 times lower or 1.72 times higher; or 22.4&#8211;68.8 mg/kg bw per day), while the median estimate of the true reference point remained nearly unchanged (factor 0.98). Hence, the additional extrapolation factor due to limitations of the evidence base is approximately 1.02 with a 90% certainty range from 0.58 to 1.78. Therefore, the TDI may be lower by a factor of up to 2 (1.78), in addition to the applicable uncertainty factors of 4 for inter&#8208;species toxicokinetics differences and 10 for inter&#8208;individual variability. By expert group judgement, an additional factor of 2.5 in the extrapolation of the reference point to the TDI is considered sufficient to cover all additional uncertainties of limited study design, which are not covered by the standard factors (an overall uncertainty factor of 100 is therefore sufficient for establishing the TDI). The Scientific Committee is 90% certain<xref rid="efs29121-note-1064" ref-type="fn">

</xref> that the established TDI is conservative.</p><p>The uncertainty analysis of the chronic effects was applied also to the ARfD, since the endpoint used for the chronic assessment is sensitive enough to be relevant to potential acute effects, such that the ARfD in this assessment is equal to the TDI. There is uncertainty about the length of bromide exposure that may lead to sufficient thyroid hormone disturbance during pregnancy to result in neurodevelopmental effects. There is considerable uncertainty about whether the short period of bromide exposure assumed in the calculation is sufficient to trigger such an effect and therefore the ARfD is conservative.</p><p>

</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>After exposure of rats to 19,200 mg NaBr/kg diet for 4&#8201;weeks, histopathological changes were observed, characterised by an increase of follicles and a decrease in their size.</p>
<p>The follicular epithelium was greatly heightened while the colloid was decreased in amount and more granular in appearance. This was also seen after an exposure time of 12&#8201;weeks. No marked changes in the histological picture of the thyroid were detected in the lower dosage groups, irrespective of the exposure time.</p>
</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The information reported include a description, 4 microphotographs from control and high dose group (H&amp;E and T4) and a summary table of histopathology.</p>
<p>The <underline underline-style="single">narrative description</underline> points to follicular cell hypertrophy, increased in incidence and severity in the high dose only. Follicular epithelial cells are described as increased in height; follicles show smaller lumen with pale colloid, granular. No features indicative of epithelial hyperplasia are described (no epithelial cell piling up or projections into the follicular lumen). The description &#8216;increase in follicles and decrease in size&#8217; is not supported by morphometric investigations; therefore, it should be interpreted as qualitative and likely related to the follicular epithelial hypertrophy. It is noted that there is no harmonised score classification for follicular cell hypertrophy, and no criteria are provided in this paper.</p>
<p>The <underline underline-style="single">pictures</underline> confirm follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid at high dose; though it is acknowledged that similar changes can be seen in control Wistar rat in the central part of the thyroid (see also below). In the absence of severity score criteria defined by the author and considering that only one image at high magnification is provided, it is difficult to conclude on the severity score of this finding; the qualitative score proposed in the paper could correspond to a minimal/mild condition based on the descriptive pathology and reported images. Of note, no features indicative of hyperplasia are identified in the proposed picture.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The <underline underline-style="single">summary tables</underline> indicate &#8216;degree of activation&#8217; slight to strong to describe histopathological findings. A clear increase in the incidence and severity is seen at the high dose (19,200ppm), with almost all the animals affected up to &#8216;strong&#8217; score on week 4, without apparent progression on week 12. It is noted also that &#8216;degree of activation&#8217; is described in a few control animals (2/20 at week 4 and 12) and in some animals throughout groups other than the high dose; however, these were a few and described as slight. It is, therefore, confirmed that histopathological findings are present at the high dose only, while there are no differences between controls and groups at 20, 75, 300 and 1200 ppm in thyroid gland histology. To substantiate the severity score of &#8216;strong&#8217; activation, criteria should have been included or the score should have been substantiated with more appropriate reporting of the pictures with example of &#8216;slight&#8217; and &#8216;strong&#8217;. In addition, it is known that the size of the thyroid follicles can vary in normal rats and it is not homogeneously distributed. Inactive &#8216;cold&#8217; follicles are present in the periphery of the gland. These are considered to be a reserve of thyroglobulin and are activated when higher amount of thyroid hormones is necessary. These follicles are large, with a flat to cuboidal epithelium and contain a densely and homogenously stained colloid. Smaller follicles, with cuboidal epithelium and less amount of paler colloid are present in the centre of the gland. The selected high magnification picture should also indicate from where (central or periphery part of the organ) in the thyroid gland they were taken and representative of. Therefore, without a dose related effect in the severity of the finding, without a positive control indicative of the dynamic range of the histological changes, without a clear geographic description of the sampling included in the picture, the histological changes described in the study should be considered of minimal/mild severity and are expected to be reversible following a recovery period.</p>
<p>At <underline underline-style="single">immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC)</underline> a more rarefied and paler colloid accompanies an apparent decrease in T4 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining at the top dose; this possibly indicates a less functional or a reduced amount of thyroglobulin in the lumen of thyroid follicles. It is noted that the authors describe that no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this analysis.</p>
<p>IHC assessment of the pituitary was reported in a tabulated summary and using a selective picture; no objective counting of the positive cells was done, and the analysis was conducted for the top dose animals only. The tabulated summary indicates a time related increase in the number of TSH positive cells in the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>Overall, histopathological findings suggest thyroid activation at the high dose group (19,200ppm). Corroborating morphological evidence of a likely follicular cell hypertrophy should have been the increase in thyroid weight, but with only the reporting of thyroid weight relative to body weight, this evidence remains uncertain.</p>

Also in the 1200 mg/kg diet group, the T4 level was significantly reduced after the 4&#8208;week exposure period. TSH levels were significantly increased in the highest dose group.

<p>Overall, histopathological changes are consistent with a drop in T4 and increase in TSH at the high dose, which was not overactivated by TRH treatment. The decrease in T4 and the increase in TSH were considered of a biologically relevant magnitude.</p>

<p>Narrative descriptions in the paper often refer to conditions that are generally captured at light microscopy examination (e.g. small follicles, microfollicles). Considering the limited set of pictures available, the results specifically referring to ultrastructural features (i.e. related to subcellular structures) are considered relevant to discuss.</p>

<p>As compared to the control, the most relevant features in treated rats were dilated tubular structures (endoplasmic reticulum) and increased number of subapical granules. Elongated microvilli and increasingly evident coated pits are also noted; however, the limited view on follicle lumen in the control picture does not allow a proper comparison. Some intraluminal debris (Figure&#160;7). Figures&#160;11 and 12 show swollen mitochondria with broken cristae, while the outer membrane is preserved. Bizarre nuclei in Figure&#160;8 are of unclear significance. It difficult to separate these last two observations from the occurrence of technical artefact, possibly of fixative nature.</p>
<p>The authors report of small/microfollicles, that can be identified in Figures&#160;6 and 10. Note that the authors define Figure&#160;6 as presenting a neoplastic condition, unclear on which basis. The author is also quoting hyperplastic conditions but there is no mention of mitotic activity in the gland. Therefore, both neoplastic as well as hyperplastic definitions are likely referring to the increased number of newly formed microfollicles. The author describes two different types of thyrocytes, which are likely representing the morphological dynamic state of cells producing thyroglobulin.</p>
<p>The author is describing changes in the nuclei as increase density of the chromatin and incisions. Although artefacts (see above) cannot be excluded, these changes, if real, are more suggestive of apoptosis, while the author is claiming that necrotic thyrocytes and/or cellular debris were occasionally observed. This is a contradicting observation. In addition, the overall pattern is suggestive of cell activation; in this case it would be expected to see less condensed euchromatin, indicative of increase in DNA synthesis. These aspects are therefore representing an uncertainty.</p>
<p>The author is quoting an increase in the number of microfollicles. Although no proper morphometric analysis was performed, the author is quoting an average dimension of follicles in control animals of 30&#8211;50 um and of 8&#8211;20 um. How to interpret the assessment of the microfollicles is difficult without proper sampling and statistics and remains uncertain because the measure of 8 um corresponds to the measure of an erythrocyte (diameter).</p>
<p>No obvious change in the colloid ultrastructural characteristics (tinctorial properties, homogeneity), beside the presence of some debris.</p>
<p>Because it is not clear how many animals were assessed for the EM, assuming that all animals in the study were included, an incidence table summarising the frequency of the reported ultrastructural changes should have been included and should be considered for the interpretation of the findings</p>

There are no relevant differences between these publications concerning the effect, tolerability and side effects of potassium/sodium/ammonium bromide in dogs and cats. The brief summary below is based on these publications without attribution to specific articles.</p><p>Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder in dogs, and the prevalence is estimated to be from 0.5% to 5.7%. The anticonvulsive properties of bromide have been known since the mid&#8208;1800s, although its use in veterinary medicine has experienced a resurgence after a report in 1986 of the concurrent use of bromide and phenobarbital to control refractory epilepsy in dogs. Bromide was originally described as an add&#8208;on treatment for epileptic dogs that were poorly controlled with phenobarbital. More recently, bromide has gained use as a sole antiepileptic therapy in dogs, either as a first&#8208;line drug or in dogs with intolerable side effects from phenobarbital.</p><p>The mechanism of antiepileptic activity is unclear, although it is often stated that it is due to hyperpolarisation of neurons caused by bromide entry through chloride channels. Recent evidence shows that it increases GABAergic inhibition.</p><p>The initial therapy with KBr is a daily oral dose of 20&#8211;40 and 10&#8211;20 mg/kg bw per day as maintenance dosage for dogs and cats, respectively. The amounts should be corrected for an equivalent bromide level when other salts are used instead (Bergman &amp; Coates,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Boothe,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). If seizure control is needed more rapidly, a loading dosage (400&#8211;600 mg/kg bw divided into 5 doses over 24&#8211;48 h) could be administered. The elimination half&#8208;life ranges from 25 to 46&#8201;days in dogs (and 1 day in cats). Accordingly, it can take 3&#8211;4 months to reach steady&#8208;state concentrations. The target serum concentration for monotherapy is 2&#8211;3 mg/mL. Trepanier et&#160;al., in their study with the participation of 122 dogs with epilepsy, reported that the therapeutic range for serum bromide concentrations is 0.88 to 3.00 mg/mL for KBr treatment alone (Trepanier et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0263" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Clinical experience indicates that bromide is effective as monotherapy, and some veterinary neurologists consider it to be the initial drug of choice for any dog with idiopathic epilepsy. The addition of bromide improves seizure control of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy refractory to phenobarbital. It is also applied together with phenobarbital.</p><p>Some published studies have reported possible adverse effects observed in dogs (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and cats (Baka &amp; Polizopoulou,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) treated with bromide as an antiepileptic drug. It is worth mentioning that there are also studies not showing any adverse drug events in bromide&#8208;treated dogs and cats (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al. published a comprehensive review on the safety of KBr in dogs (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Neurologic signs were the most consistently reported adverse drug events, such as sedation, irritability, restlessness, depression, ataxia, hind limb paresis, mydriasis, stupor and coma (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Bhatti et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Most adverse reactions to bromide tend to be dose&#8208;dependent and appeared to be reversible (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Boothe,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Bromide toxicosis in dogs was most frequently associated with high serum bromide concentrations; although very sensitive dogs may also develop signs of toxicosis (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The adverse reactions may be magnified when KBr is administered in combination with phenobarbital. Baird&#8208;Heinz (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reviewed other publications with descriptive information on adverse drug reactions in other farm animals (rabbits, cattle, goats, horses), and concluded that the information reported was limited to clearly attribute such effects to bromide administration.</p><p>Vomiting, transient diarrhoea, and bloody faeces have been also reported in dogs but do not appear to require cessation of KBr treatment for resolution. Other typical side effects observed occasionally in dogs treated with KBr have been polyphagia with weight increase (up to 10%), salivation, polydipsia, polyuria or anorexia and weight loss (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Bhatti et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Uncommon idiosyncratic reactions of KBr in dogs include personality changes (aggressive behaviour, irritability, hyperactivity), but there is insufficient information to assess the effects of KBr on behavioural changes (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Most adverse reactions occur in the initial weeks of treatment and subside (partly or completely), once KBr steady&#8208;state concentrations are reached (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Bhatti et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>In some cases, bromide toxicity has been reported secondary to renal insufficiency, and, therefore, it has been suggested that the initial dose of bromide should be reduced when renal function is impaired (Nichols et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0188" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Nichols et&#160;al. attributed a bromide toxicosis of a 8&#8208;year old Labrador Retriever dog, treated for epilepsy at standard doses with 29 mg KBr/kg bw per day (corresponding to 19.5 mg Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>/kg bw per day) and 3.8 mg phenobarbital/kg bw per day, to renal insufficiency, which reduced the bromide elimination by the kidneys. The dog developed hind limb weakness, ataxia and stupor, following a high serum bromide concentration (3120 mg/L), while a therapeutic range is between 1000 and 2000 mg/L. After only 24&#8211;48 h of intravenous saline dieresis, serum bromide concentration decreased to 1980 and 1480 mg/L, respectively, while the hind limp weakness and disorientation resolved rapidly.</p><p>Dermatologic reactions (non&#8208;suppurative, macular and scaly dermatitis) are rare and not of concern with clinical KBr use in dogs, while respiratory disease is unlikely (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have suggested increased risk of pancreatitis in KBr treated dogs, although it could be also related to polyphagia and garbage ingestion (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therapeutic administration of KBr in dogs was not found to affect thyroid weight or serum tT4, fT4, T3 and TSH concentrations or to cause histologic changes in the thyroid (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>A further publication (Charalambous et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) reported the results of a systematic review and meta&#8208;analysis of adverse effects by antiepileptic drugs in dogs. Ninety studies, including six conference proceedings, reporting clinical outcomes of adverse effects of various antiepileptic drugs were identified. Direct comparisons suggested a better safety for imepitoin, levetiracetam, and phenobarbital, compared to potassium bromide. However, none of these comparisons showed a statistically significant difference. Individual drug assessments placed the potassium bromide also behind the three drugs mentioned above, supported with a strong level of evidence. Adverse effects usually appeared mild for all antiepileptic drugs and disappeared when doses/serum levels were monitored or after the drug was withdrawn.</p><p>Twenty&#8208;one studies presented data about the safety of KBr either as monotherapy (8 studies) or adjunctive therapy to phenobarbital and/or other drugs (16 studies), giving a combined sample size of 1940 dogs. Fifteen studies reported adverse effects, including neurological signs; from these, 7/15 (47%) and 10/15 (67%) studies reported adverse effects for potassium bromide monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, respectively. Specifically, in all the studies, the adverse effects most commonly reported were ataxia followed by sedation, polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, paraparesis, hyperactivity, vomiting, increased serum ALP and ALT activity.</p><p>In cats, bromide use as an anticonvulsant has been associated with life&#8208;threatening idiosyncratic allergic pneumonitis (Boothe et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), or the development of moderate to severe bronchoalveolitis/pulmonary fibrosis (Baka &amp; Polizopoulou,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In their retrospective study, Boothe et&#160;al.&#160;(<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) associated the reported coughing in 6 out of 17 cats to allergic reactions, rather than concentration (dose) or duration of bromide administration dependent relationship, also noting that allergic responses to bromide have been reported in the human literature. Bromide&#8208;associated lower airway disease with mild&#8208;to&#8208;moderate cough and/or dyspnoea was observed in some cats after starting bromide (NaBr) therapy (Bertolani et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Klang et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0138" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The onset of respiratory signs started between 1 month and 8&#8201;years of initiating bromide therapy. The airway disorders seem to be the result of a hypersensitivity or allergic reaction without any dose (serum bromide concentration range for coughing cats was 1.0 to 3.2 mg/mL) or time dependence (duration of treatment). Significant clinical improvements were evident after ceasing bromide therapy (Bertolani et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Other adverse effects reported in cats included polydipsia, polyuria, vomiting or weight gain or grogginess (Baird&#8208;Heinz et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Boothe et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).

</p><p>The fetus is fully dependent on maternal thyroid hormone until the fetal thyroid gland is developed, which occurs between gestational days 17&#8211;20 in rats (Perez&#8208;Castillo &amp; Ferreiro, <xref rid="efs29121-bib-0210" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, maternal hypothyroidism affects neurodevelopment in Wistar rats (Mafikandi et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0163" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and development of the auditory tissues is shown to be a critical target of thyroid hormone activity associated with TR&#946; receptor (Mustieles et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0180" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Regarding auditory system cochlea is a major target of thyroid hormones, specifically by promoting terminal differentiation of a variety of cells in mice (Ng et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0186" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Experimental evidence indicates that changes in T4 in the range of 50% reduction are sufficient to permanently impair the auditory system (Crofton,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gilbert &amp; Sui,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0100" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This was confirmed in a later publication where regulatory developmental neurotoxicity endpoints were affected by a decrease of tT4 in a similar range of magnitude (Marty et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0167" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Additional evidence from experiments conducted in rats treated with perchlorate under conditions of iodine deficiency indicate that a drop in tT4 of around 28% can induce changes in hippocampal neurotransmission (Gilbert &amp; Sui,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0100" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The experimental observations of impaired thyroid function in the suckling pups of dams exposed to high bromide levels (with more pronounced decreases of tT4 and T3 in serum, compared to reduced thyroid hormone levels of the dams), suggests potential hypothyroidism, with implications for associated neurodevelopmental deficits.</p><p>Furthermore, several studies in rodents, used in support of the KER444 (AOP 54), have demonstrated that thyroid hormone can regulate the expression of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may play a critical role in CNS development and brain function through regulation of synaptic transmission, dendritic structure and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. Lower thyroid hormone levels during fetal and/or neonatal periods resulted in a trend of reduced BDNF expression (mRNA and proteins) in the developing brain (mostly affecting the hippocampus and cortex, the key brain areas for learning and memory function). However, there is inconsistent evidence in the literature and the impact of thyroid hormone disturbance on BDNF expression and its role in thyroid&#8208;mediated effects on brain development is debated (Gilbert &amp; Lasley,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0098" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In AOP 54, reduced BDNF (KE) results in abnormal GABAergic neurons and synaptogenesis (KEs) leading to impairment of learning and memory. Alteration of GABAergic function is associated with bromide exposure (see below), although it is not known if this relationship is mediated via BDNF. Goodman and Gilbert (Goodman &amp; Gilbert,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0103" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) induced maternal thyroid hormone insufficiency in rats by exposing pregnant dams to the goitrogenic propylthiouracil (PTU) at doses of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 10 ppm in the drinking water from gestational day 6 through weaning on postnatal day 30. Administration of PTU reduces thyroid hormone production by inhibiting thyroperoxidase (TPO). Brain sections of the offspring at day 23 were examined and showed a bilateral cellular malformation, a heterotopia, positioned within the white matter of the corpus callosum of both hemispheres. This heterotopia consisted of neurons emerging between gestational days 17&#8211;19 and showed a dose&#8208;dependent increase in size with decreases in thyroid hormone concentrations. The malformation was formed at modest maternal thyroid hormone insufficiency (45% reduction in T4 and no change in T3) and persisted in adult offspring. It was reduced in size with prenatal thyroid hormone replacement. Cortical heterotopias are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as learning disorders and epilepsy (O'Shaughnessy &amp; Gilbert,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0197" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, treating a pregnant rat for 5&#8201;days with propylthiouracil during the perinatal period (GD19&#8208;PN2) induced heterotopia in all offspring (O'Shaughnessy &amp; Gilbert,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0197" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Sharlin et&#160;al. gradually decreased serum tT4 concentrations in rats using PTU and increased serum TSH, type 2 deiodinase mRNA expression and enzyme activity in the brain, and the expression of the mRNA encoding the tri&#8208;iodothyronine (T3) transporter MCT8 in the postnatal day (P) 15 cortex (Sharlin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0238" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A target of T3 action, the mRNA encoding RC3/neurogranin showed a strong negative linear correlation with serum total T4 despite the adaptive responses. The researchers conclude that these findings do not support the hypothesis that the developing rat brain is able to compensate for low T4 (Sharlin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0238" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The absence of thyroid compensatory abilities that are not yet developed in early life makes fetal/neonatal population particularly sensitive (Sharlin et&#160;al.,&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-bib-0238" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec></app><app id="efs29121-app-0005" content-type="APPENDIX"><label>APPENDIX E</label><title>Benchmark Dose (BMD) modelling</title><sec id="efs29121-sec-0124"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="efs29121-sec-0126"><title>Selection of the BMR</title><p>The EFSA guidance on BMD (2022) recommends that the BMR should reflect the onset of a human&#8208;relevant adverse effect, meaning that a response above the BMR is considered adverse.

The sources of uncertainty were identified and prioritised for the four areas of the assessment: Hazard assessment for human and animal health (Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0025" ref-type="table">H.1</xref>); screening scenarios of bromide in food and dietary exposure assessment in food producing and non&#8208;food producing animals feed (Table&#160;<xref rid="efs29121-tbl-0026" ref-type="table">H.2</xref>).</p><p>The procedures described in Sections&#160;7, 8 and 9 of the EFSA 2018 Guidance on Uncertainty analysis were followed to (i) identify uncertainties in each of the two main parts, (ii) further group uncertainties, when possible, according to their source and (iii) prioritise uncertainties according to their impact on the respective assessment (hazard or exposure). Prioritisation was based on the potential impact on the overall conclusion of the related section.</p><sec id="efs29121-sec-0156"><title>Uncertainty characterisation for bromide hazard assessment</title><p>Uncertainties that were assigned higher priority in the prioritisation stage were individually examined for their impact on the reference value and the direction of the likely true value. Uncertainties assigned lower priority would not substantially impact the reference value and were not individually examined but taken into consideration in the overall uncertainty.</p><p>Impact of the prioritised sources of uncertainty on the reference value:</p><p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower" id="efs29121-list-0030"><list-item id="efs29121-li-0248"><p>Low method accuracy increases variability of the BMD modelling and overestimates risk (lower BMDL). Low sensitivity of analytical methods results in higher reference points and underestimates risk (higher BMDL), due to inability to detect low hormone levels, and/or small changes, and/or analysis of small samples. Since fetuses or pups were not subject to analysis, the lower analytical sensitivity does not directly impact the reference point. Measurements in young adult animals were used and methods such as RIA and ELISA are established and acceptable. These analytical methods have a poor dynamic range (steep standard curve), which leads to high variability in analytical results even from small differences in plasma T4 concentrations. A higher variability results in a wider confidence interval of the dose response data and therefore in a lower BMDL. Overall, this element was not expected to have a big effect on the calculation of the TDI.</p></list-item><list-item id="efs29121-li-9248"><p>The relationship between plasma T4 and brain fT3 concentrations is not characterised. Thyroid hormones (T4, TSH) are surrogates of potential HPT disruption by bromide, while fT3 is the marker most functionally meaningful for interpretation of risk to brain development. While plasma T4 is an established and appropriate indicator of effects on the thyroid in adult animals, there are no data of the fT3 concentrations in the brain (developing or adult). If fetal brain T3 is affected more than maternal plasma T4, then risk to fetal brain is underestimated; if fetal brain T3 is less affected than maternal plasma T4, e.g. due to adaptive responses, then risk to fetal brain is overestimated. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of adaptive response to decreased maternal plasma T4 in maintaining fetal brain fT3. If their adaptive response is effective, changes in plasma T4 may overestimate the changes in brain fT3. This uncertainty may lead to a reference point that is either higher or lower than the true (equal uncertainty in both directions). It is noted that the available plasma T4 data were obtained during a relevant life stage.</p></list-item><list-item id="efs29121-li-8248"><p>The method for assessing histopathological changes in the thyroid (determining hypertrophy by differences in follicular height compared to control) is not optimal. The scoring of observed alterations is qualitative and subjective and underestimates relevant alterations. A more sensitive method would likely result in lower reference point. The method is well established and does not overrepresent alterations (does not overestimate risk) and it is not likely that it would result in higher reference point, as this method. This uncertainty leads to a reference point value that is higher than the true (true reference point is more likely lower).</p></list-item><list-item id="efs29121-li-7248"><p>Data on plasma T4 in young adult animals may not be representative of the most sensitive population, the fetus. There are no data on the impact of bromide on fetal plasma T4 concentrations. There is altered maternal homeostasis during pregnancy and increased need for iodine. The fetus may be just as sensitive or more sensitive than the tested organisms (and not able to compensate for changes in thyroid hormone concentrations) and the reference point may be lower. It is less likely that the fetus is less sensitive, considering the key role of the thyroid in development; hence, the reference point will not be higher. A comparative thyroid assessment would reduce this uncertainty if available: where thyroid hormones are measured in the dam and the fetus with sensitive methods (such as LC&#8208;MS&#8208;MS), including total and free T3, T4 and TSH in blood and fT3 in the fetal brain and after birth, under conditions of I&#8208;sufficient and I&#8208;deficient diets and iodine measurements in the thyroid gland. Assessment of DNT endpoints in the same animals would further reduce the uncertainty. Currently, there is no experience with effects of chemicals on fT3 levels in brain and this constitutes a large uncertainty.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="alpha-lower" id="efs29121-list-0031"><list-item id="efs29121-li-0249"><p>The use of plasma T4 is an established and reliable marker of thyroid changes and a surrogate of perturbation of HPT axis, based on the established AOP (as a MIE). Parallel data on TSH concentrations would improve the interpretation of plasma T4 changes. These data are not available in all studies but there is evidence of moderate increase in TSH in some studies (even if not statistically significant) that corroborate the evidence of thyroid depression by bromide.</p></list-item><list-item id="efs29121-li-5149"><p>Studies in young adult animals are reliable models to detect thyroid effects that are relevant to humans. Adult animals are considered to be at least as sensitive as adult humans.</p></list-item><list-item id="efs29121-li-5148"><p>The methodologies for measurement of thyroid hormones in plasma (in adults) are well established, and in this case, the LOD is not a limitation to detecting hormone concentrations.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>For these reasons, the endpoint selected is considered sensitive enough and relevant for extrapolating effects to humans. Based on similar sensitivity for the endpoint selected, an interspecies uncertainty factor for toxicodynamics is not needed.</p></sec><sec id="efs29121-sec-0157"><title>EKE results</title><p>

<p>There is uncertainty about thyroid hormone changes related to adverse effects in thyroid function and thyroid&#8208;dependent functions. However, histological changes have been reported in at least one study together with hormone level changes to provide sufficient evidence of adverse effects on the thyroid in the tested dose range (Loeber 1983).</p>
<p>A BMR of 60% is indicative of downstream adverse effects on the thyroid function in the adult.</p>
<p>A lower BMR is relevant for the developing fetus (pregnant women). There is uncertainty about a threshold of serum T4 reduction associated with impaired neurodevelopment. A biologically based BMR of 20% T4 decrease in animals indicates changes that are adverse for neurodevelopment in the fetus and is above the range of variability in control animals.</p>
<p>A BMR of 15% reduction in T4 is based on variability in control animals. This would result in a more conservative BMDL which is considered adverse for neurodevelopment when occurring in the same individual during pregnancy, but not when occurring as <italic toggle="yes">mean</italic> T4 decrease (within range of variability).</p>

</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The RP is derived from studies (Loeber 1983, van Leeuwen 1983, or ECHA 2016b report) in which parallel lines of evidence are reported, including changes of thyroid hormone levels and histopathology. This reduces the uncertainty about the selection of the reference point.</p>
<p>Some studies of lower reliability have reported possible thyroid effects at lower doses than the studies used for establishing the RP (Velicky et&#160;al.). However, limitations in the study design and conduct introduce uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Furthermore, the effect size of T4 decrease reported remained below the BMR of 20% (see above).</p>
<p>Due to large interindividual variability in levels of thyroid hormones, the range representing adverse effect is wide; however, the BMR is expressed as % change rather than hormone level and is less subject to individual variability.</p>
