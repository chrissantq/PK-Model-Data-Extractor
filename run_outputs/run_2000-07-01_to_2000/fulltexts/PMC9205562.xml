It is mainly composed of three layers that span from superficial to deep, including the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Menon, 2015</xref>). The dermal skin contains components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen fibers, that contribute to the strength and toughness of the skin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ngan et al., 2015</xref>). As the main component of connective tissue, collagen is the most abundant protein in the skin, comprising 25&#8211;35% of the protein content in the whole body (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Di Lullo et al., 2002</xref>). Collagen is also widely used in cosmetics and biomedical products (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Toki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). After exogenous collagen is smeared on the skin, it permeates through the cuticle to the dermis and forms a reticular structure to support the structure of the dermis and supply more extracellular matrix to keep the skin elastic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chai et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we need to dynamically visualize the process of transdermal absorption of exogenous collagen and measure the extent of collagen absorption with qualitative and quantitative approaches.</p><p>To date, various technologies have been applied to measure the biomedical administration of collagen to skin, including chemical assays (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fediuk et al., 2012</xref>), tissue inspection (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>), isotope tracing (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cross et al., 2007</xref>) and circulating diffusion chamber (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gamer et al., 2006</xref>), which can only be used to quantitatively examine the transdermal absorption of exogenous collagen <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. However, these approaches could not dynamically track the process of transdermal absorption <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and evaluate the real-time effects of biomedical administration. These limitations could be overcome by nonlinear optical microscopy, such as two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Denk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">K&#246;nig et al., 2007</xref>), and second harmonic generation (SHG) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Campagnola and Loew, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pittet et al., 2014</xref>). Among such technologies, SHG is a well-established method to directly visualize anisotropic biological tissues that possess large hyperpolarizabilities, such as collagen (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Thrasivoulou et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, SHG imaging has many advantages, such as a higher signal-to-noise ratio than autofluorescence imaging, detection of intrinsic signals without extrinsic dyes, and the utilization of nonlinear excitation from molecular fluorescence (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kiyomatsu et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, few studies have examined the effects of drug administration on the skin using SHG because of the challenges in using it to distinguish endogenous from exogenous collagen. Recently, two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) imaging has been widely applied to visualize the dynamics of intrinsic molecules and cells in living specimens through conventional labeling via staining or fluorescent proteins (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). Due to the divergent mechanisms of SHG and TPEF, we speculate that they could be combined to provide complementary information for the dynamic observation of biological processes. However, few studies have reported the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging of the transdermal absorption of collagen with a combination of SHG and TPEF (SHG-TPEF). Therefore, there is an urgent need to obtain <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> high-resolution images of fibrillar collagen during the process of transdermal absorption using SHG-TPEF imaging, which could provide a novel approach for estimating the extent of drug absorption and further assessing the treatment effects of dermal drugs.</p><p>To address these issues, we first constructed a mouse model of transdermal absorption through administrating exogenous recombinant human collagen (R-hc), which was proved to be effective in skin absorption in our previous studies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). Second, we set up the platform of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF skin imaging. Third, we tracked the dynamic process of collagen absorption of short-term administration by <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF imaging and observed the transdermal absorption pathway. Finally, we applied Franz-type diffusion method to evaluate the collagen absorption at different time points as validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Animals</title><p>Healthy BALB/c mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (China). All animals used in this study were male adults (6&#8211;8&#160;weeks, 20 &#177; 2&#160;g body weight). Mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free environment with freely available food and water and a 12&#160;h light-dark cycle. In this study, five mice were used at each time point, each of which received a topical dose of 1&#160;mg/ml of R-hc on a shaved back on the left side of the thoracic spine and a saline control area on the right. The animal experiments were supervised and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences ( ERCCACMS21-2106-12). All experiments compliance with the Regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals of the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2 Quality Control of R-hc</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>2.2.1.R-hc</title><p>R-hc is expressed by eukaryotic cells and integrates the human-like collagen gene, which is a heterozygous type I and type III collagen gene, into the yeast chromosome. The hydroxyproline in R-hc was replaced by proline. In our previous study, we analyzed the effect of R-hc on the repair of laser skin damage in mice. The results showed that R-hc can significantly accelerate wound healing, shorten wound healing time, and promote collagen production in wounds (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2018</xref>), which suggests that R-hc could be transdermally absorbed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Fluorescent Label</title><p>For fluorescent labeling, a protein stock solution was prepared by mixing 100&#160;mg&#160;R-hc freeze-dried powder (TianJin Irheaya Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Tianjin) with 10&#160;ml 1&#160;M phosphate buffer (pH 8.5&#8211;9.0) to produce the 1&#160;ml protein labeling stock solution. To prepare the dye stock solution, anhydrous DMSO was added into a vial of iFluor&#8482; 750 SE (AAT Bioquest, Ex/Em = 749/775&#160;nm) to produce a 10&#8211;20&#160;mM stock solution, which was mixed by vortexing. Then, 1&#160;ml of the dye stock solution was added to the vial of protein solution (10&#160;ml) and shaken thoroughly. The concentration of the protein was 10&#160;mg/ml. The reaction mixture was rotated at 4&#176;C for 12&#160;h. The reaction mixture was loaded into a dialysis bag (&lt;1 kd) and placed in a large beaker containing ultrapure water in the dark. The water was changed every 4&#160;h until no fluorescence was detected in the ultrapure water. The fluorescent protein was freeze-dried into a powder for future use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3 SHG-TPEF Skin Imaging</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>2.3.1 In vivo</title><p>The back hair was shaved from the mice, which were treated with iFluor-R-hc (1&#160;mg/ml) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#160;h at room temperature while avoiding light. At the end of the experiment, all mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and fixed on a mouse plate while the back skin was fixed on holder. The full-thickness skin tissue was scanned by a two-photon scanning confocal microscope (FV1000-MPE, Olympus, Japan).</p><p>A two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy system was used for image acquisition based on the reverse detection of SHG and two-photon excited fluorescence signals from the skin. The two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy system was equipped with a water-immersion objective lens (PLAN 25X OB. W IMM, NA 1.05, Olympus) and a Ti:sapphire laser oscillator (wavelength: 690&#8211;1040&#160;nm; repetition rate: 80&#160;MHz, pulse width: 100 fs; MaiTai HP DS-OL, Spectra-Physics, Inc. CA). The SHG image acquisition was performed at an excitation wavelength of 950&#160;nm with a 690&#160;nm dichroic mirror and a 475/20&#160;nm emission filter (center wavelength/bandwidth). For the observation of iFluor-R-hc, an excitation wavelength of 790&#160;nm and a 605&#8211;680&#160;nm emission filter were used to isolate the SHG signal. The autofluorescence image was acquired with an excitation wavelength of 750&#160;nm and a 495&#8211;540&#160;nm emission filter.</p><p>The images were obtained from the epidermis and dermis and stored as a z-stack image sequence (step size of 1&#160;&#956;m in the z-axis). The image size was 512 &#215; 512 pixels, and the scanning speed was 2&#160;&#956;m/pixel. The merging of the color channels was performed using FV1000 Viewer 3.1 software (Olympus). The three-dimensional image was performed using Imaris (Imaris ver. 8.4.2, Bitplane AG, Switzerland).

Both two-photon fluorescence imaging and second harmonic imaging are second-order nonlinear processes. In addition to the needs of different filter addition, TPEF and SHG are almost identical in the optical detection system, the obtained information for both complement and confirm each other, so it has received much attention in recent years. In this paper, the infrared fluorescent probe was used to label the collagen, which can avoid the autofluorescence of the skin and reducing background noise (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Over time, we observed that collagen permeated through the hair follicle, reached the dermis, and formed reticular structures in the dermis after 4&#160;h of administration of exogenous iFluor-R-hc, which was also confirmed by <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> examinations. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to be used for the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> visualization of the transdermal absorption of biochemically administered collagen, and these findings provide a technological method for the clinical assessment of transdermal drugs in the future.</p><p>A previous study showed that compounds with a molecular weight greater than 50&#160;kDa penetrate the dermis was difficulty because of blockage by the stratum corneum (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ogiso et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, various transdermal drug delivery systems have been developed (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), but whether macromolecules can penetrate the skin is still not clear. In our study, we used <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF skin imaging to track the process of transdermal absorption of exogenous collagen, which is approximately 55&#160;kDa in size. The iFluor fluorescence signal was first detected in the hair follicle 3&#160;h after coating R-hc on the skin, which confirms that macromolecules could be absorbed by the skin. The above experimental results were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. Moreover, this combined technology has many advantages, such as noninvasiveness, the absence of conventional dyes, and good penetration of biological tissues (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kiyomatsu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it allows the long-term observation of dynamic changes at the same skin site, which can be extended to the development of an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> real-time assessment method for cosmetics and biomedical administration.</p><p>The results of the examination of R-hc transdermal absorption provided a quantitative approach for the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> assessment of the transdermal absorption of protein drugs through the combined measurement of collagen density and absorption. Specifically, we first demonstrated that a typical application of R-hc increased type III collagen and collagen fiber growth, which suggests that R-hc could increase skin elasticity. Second, we used TPEF combined with SHG imaging to study the manner and depth of R-hc absorption <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Since the stratum corneum acts as a physical barrier to skin on the surface of the epidermis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Elias and Choi, 2005</xref>), it has an impact on the penetration efficiency of R-hc. However, the results of the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> transdermal absorption model showed that the fluorescence intensity of type III collagen was significantly increased after 24&#160;h of R-hc administration, which suggesed that iFluor-R-hc could still effectively permeate the epidermal skin. Potts and colleagues found that an increased molecular weight increased lipophilicity and permeability, which suggests that the penetration of drugs into the skin is tightly associated with the molecular characteristics of the drug (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Potts and Guy, 1992</xref>). Lin and colleagues also considered that the effect of lipophilicity is a more dominant factor than the molecular weight in the passive diffusion permeability (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 1996</xref>). We observed the fluorescence signal of iFluor in the hair follicle after 3&#160;h of R-hc application by <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF imaging, and the dermis was interlaced into a reticular network after 4&#160;h. Therefore, we assume that the osmotic effect of R-hc in the dermis could be attributed to higher permeability.</p><p>HE staining is a classic method to detect the pathophysiological changes of skin, but it can only observe the skin&#8217;s thickness changes in various layers, inflammatory cell invasion, and other indicators, but the absorption and distribution route and collagen content, which are directly related to wound healing or drug efficacy assessment, can not be observed. In our study, we examined SHG intensity to measure the content of collagen in the dermal skin. SHG imaging provides increased resolution and contrast when examining collagen than typical histological staining analysis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, it is also a feasible and fast method that could be applied to the imaging of thicker tissue without fixing, slicing and staining (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2003</xref>). SHG intensity could accurately reflect the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> changes in collagen. Specifically, in the examination of HE staining of R-hc, we found that the amount of R-hc gradually increased after iFluor-R-hc administration and reached a peak at the 4&#160;h time point. Similar results were also observed in the analysis of Franz-type diffusion, which was consistent with the findings of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF skin imaging. These findings indicate that SHG imaging could provide reliable measurements for the real-time evaluation of collagen absorption.</p><p>Collagen is one of the core constituents that maintains the elasticity of the skin; thus, reducing collagen in the skin would result in wrinkled and flabby skin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). In our study, we observed that R-hc gradually permeated the dermal skin and formed the reticular structure after 3&#160;h of administration. This suggests that exogenous collagen could not only supplement skin collagen to meet the needs of anti-aging cosmetics but also form granulation tissue together with intrinsic collagen to fill wounds in tissue.</p><p>SHG-TPEF imaging allows us to observe the manner of transdermal absorption and aggregation sites of R-hc <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, but some limitations still exist for this technology. For example, individual differences in cortical thickness might cause variation in the scanning results, which could have an impact on examining SHG intensity. Alternatively, the autofluorescence of tissue might affect the detection of exogenous collagen labeled with fluorescent probes. A previous study showed that the excitation wavelength of tissue autofluorescence was between 720 and 880&#160;nm, and the overall signal sensitivity (420&#8211;490&#160;nm) was affected by the convolution of the spectral transmittance and the detector efficiency (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Breunig et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the use of infrared dyes could be useful for the fluorescent labeling of exogenous proteins, and bandpass filters could be adjusted to reduce the effects of autofluorescence on skin scanning.</p><p>In this study, we used <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> SHG-TPEF skin imaging to track the dynamic process of the transdermal absorption of exogenous collagen in a mouse model. We observed that exogenous collagen gradually permeated the dermal skin via hair follicles and sebaceous glands and formed a reticular structure (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), which was also confirmed by traditional <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> skin imaging.
