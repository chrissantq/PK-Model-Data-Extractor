The physiological functions of S1P are mediated by its binding to five subtypes of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Among S1P receptors (S1PRs), S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) is critical for lymphocyte trafficking and progression of immune and inflammatory responses. The binding of S1P to S1PR1 causes activation of Gi, a subunit of heterotrimeric&#160;guanine nucleotide-binding proteins&#160;(G proteins), leading to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase-induced cAMP synthesis and subsequent activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. The binding also induces the phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of &#946;-arrestin and subsequent cellular internalization of the ligand&#8211;receptor complex.</p><p id="Par4">Given its roles in lymphocyte trafficking, S1PR1 is a target for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. FTY720, also named fingolimod, is a first-generation S1PR1 modulator that was approved as a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, FTY720 is phosphorylated in vivo into FTY720-phosphate (FTY720-P), which serves as a functional antagonist of S1PRs including S1PR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, the binding of FTY720-P activates S1PR1 signaling, leading to the internalization and subsequent degradation of S1PR1. As a result, administration of FTY720 causes long-lasting inhibition of S1PR1 signaling through the depletion of cell surface S1PR1. However, in addition to lymphocyte trafficking, S1PR1 controls the function of cardiac cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, the agonistic activity of FTY720-P provokes bradycardia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a temporal reduction of the heart rate, as an undesirable side effect.</p><p id="Par5">Competitive antagonists of S1PR1 would not cause side effects ascribed to the agonistic activity. W146, which has a similar structure to FTY720-P, was the first competitive antagonist of S1PR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the in vivo efficacy of W146 is poor and transient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In addition to FTY720-based S1PR1 modulators such as W146, structurally distinct S1PR1 modulators have been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Among them, NIBR-0213 is a competitive antagonist of S1PR1 that displayed persistent efficacy in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Further development of potent S1PR1 antagonists may offer more effective methods of treatment for autoimmune diseases such as MS.</p><p id="Par6">The efficacy of a drug is affected by its residence time in the target protein in addition to its equilibrium-binding affinity and pharmacokinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the determination of drug&#8211;protein binding kinetics is useful for predicting drug efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Some studies have revealed that certain antagonists exhibit insurmountable antagonism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, defined as the inability of the pre-bound antagonist to be completely replaced by a competing ligand under nonequilibrium conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Such inhibitors are considered to possess pseudoirreversible inhibitory activity, characterized by a slow dissociation from the receptor without the formation of a permanent covalent bond for inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, it was reported that drugs with pseudoirreversible inhibition properties show persistent in vivo efficacies because of their long residence time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Computational approaches can be used to investigate the binding behavior of drugs to target proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Metadynamics (MetaD), which is a sampling method enhanced by escaping local free-energy minima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and other approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> are available for a detailed description of binding and unbinding kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the linking of these computational estimations for binding and dissociation kinetics to practical in vitro and in vivo efficacies of a drug remains a challenge.</p><p id="Par8">Here, we show that the potent S1PR1 antagonist KSI-6666 achieves pseudoirreversible inhibition of S1PR1 activity by interacting with a specific methionine residue. KSI-6666 demonstrates potent and sustained efficacy in in vivo mouse disease models. In vitro studies reveal that KSI-6666 functions as a pseudoirreversible inhibitor. A combination of MetaD simulation and experimental validation suggests that this pseudoirreversible inhibition depends on the interaction between a methionine residue within S1PR1 and KSI-6666, accounting for the persistent potency of KSI-6666 in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>KSI-6666 is a potent and selective competitive antagonist of S1PR1 and suppresses autoimmune and intestinal inflammation</title><p id="Par9">To develop new competitive antagonists of S1PR1, we synthesized 1181 compounds with structures similar to previous S1PR1 inhibitors. Subsequently, we screened these compounds by evaluating their antagonistic effects through in vitro GTP analog binding to Gi in cell membrane fractions obtained from S1PR1-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells treated with an S1PR1 agonist. Through this process, we identified the lead compound 1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), bearing similarities to a compound previously discovered by Novartis. Further optimization of lead compound 1 was conducted using the GTP binding assay screening, employing the S1PR1 agonist from Merck (Merck S1PR1 agonist)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In addition, the reduction in blood leukocyte count induced by inhibition of S1PR1 after the oral administration of compounds was evaluated in in vivo screening in rats (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The selection identified a S1PR1 antagonist (RS)-KSI-6666 (hereafter referred to as KSI-6666 for simplicity), a racemic form with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 6.4&#8201;nM in GTP binding assay. Reduction in blood leukocyte count caused by KSI-6666 was observed at 48&#8201;h after administration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), and thus it may be more persistent than NIBR-0213 since its response duration was reported as 24&#8201;h at 30&#8201;mg/kg administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

The binding of an agonist to S1PR1 results in the activation of Gi and receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consistently, FTY720-P and the Merck S1PR1 agonist led to an increment in the GTP binding to Gi and a decrease of surface S1PR1 on HEK293 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). In contrast, treatment with KSI-6666 did not activate S1PR1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>), confirming its lack of agonistic activity. Interestingly, the KSI-6666 treatment led to a decrease in GTP binding activity and an increase in the surface amount of S1PR1, even in the absence of agonists (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). This suggests its ability to suppress the constitutive activation of S1PR1. Thus, KSI-6666 exhibits the characteristics of an inverse agonist, defined as a compound that elicits pharmacological activity contrary to that of the agonist by binding to the same receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, in addition to the competitive inhibitory activity. In the case of W146, inverse agonistic activity was detected at only high concentrations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">We next tested the antagonistic activity of KSI-6666 toward ligand binding to S1PR1 in other assays. S1PR1 activation increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells over-expressing G&#945;15, a subunit of G protein. KSI-6666 competitively inhibited the agonist-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization of S1PR1, but not for other S1PRs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). KSI-6666 inhibited mouse and rat S1PR1 with similar inhibitory activity as human S1PR1, demonstrating its cross-species efficacy (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Furthermore, the agonist-dependent internalization of S1PR1 on HEK293 cells was antagonized by KSI-6666 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Pretreatment with KSI-6666 completely blocked the reduction of heart rate induced by administration of FTY720 in the in vivo experiment using guinea pigs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), which most reflects the human situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These data suggest that KSI-6666 is a selective and competitive antagonist of S1PR1 in mammals, and, therefore, would not cause bradycardia as a side effect.</p><p id="Par12">S1PR1 signaling is critical for lymphocyte trafficking, and therefore, the inhibition of S1PR1 impairs lymphocyte migration from lymphoid organs to the bloodstream, thereby causing a decrease in blood lymphocyte number. In Transwell assays in vitro, the addition of KSI-6666 inhibited the motility of murine splenocytes induced by S1P (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Consistently, the administration of KSI-6666 effectively reduced blood lymphocyte numbers in rats (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>, upper) and cynomolgus monkeys (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>, lower), confirming its efficacy in both primates and rodents. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed that the numbers of CD4-, CD8-, and CD19-positive cells in mouse blood were significantly reduced 4&#8201;h after intravenous injection of KSI-6666 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). In contrast, injection of W146 caused a slight reduction of B cell number in the blood at 1&#8201;h, but not at 4&#8201;h (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). The data suggest that, compared with W146, KSI-6666 has a potent and persistent effect in suppressing lymphocyte trafficking in rodents and primates.</p><p id="Par13">In addition to the lymphocyte trafficking, S1PR1 modulators have a common effect on the endothelial barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Consistently, we observed that the repetitive oral administration of KSI-6666 caused vascular hyperpermeability-related effects such as edema in the lungs (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>), further supporting that KSI-6666 can inhibit the functions of S1PR1 in vivo. Notably, although edema was observed following the administration of both KSI-6666 and FTY720, lung function parameters, respiratory rate (f) and respiratory pressure curves (Penh), were minimally affected by KSI-6666 in comparison to FTY720 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>), suggesting a lesser impact of KSI-6666 on lung function.</p><p id="Par14">These data strongly suggested that KSI-6666 functions as a potent competitive inhibitor of S1PR1 with less effect on cardiac and pulmonary functions. We then investigated the therapeutic potential of KSI-6666 in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases by using rodent models. In the rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, pre-administration of KSI-6666 demonstrated a significant attenuation of symptom progression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Furthermore, post-administration of KSI-6666 after disease onset resulted in a reduction in symptom scores in the mouse EAE model (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Co-crystallographic data for the complex of W146 and S1PR1 (PDB: 3V2Y)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> were used for the docking study of (R)-KSI-6666. The pose of (R)-KSI-6666 with the lowest binding free energy was selected from among the docking complexes, and compared with the crystallographic structure of W146 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The validity of the docking pose was assessed through 500&#8201;ns MD simulations, demonstrating its stability (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The estimated binding free energy to S1PR1 was &#8722;68.3&#8201;kcal/mol for (R)-KSI-6666 and &#8722;65.4&#8201;kcal/mol for W146, supporting stable binding of (R)-KSI-6666. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis using the recently determined S1PR1 structure from cryogenic electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> as the initial structure supported the binding of KSI-6666 on the ligand binding site of S1PR1 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Overlay of the pose of (R)-KSI-6666 with the W146 structure suggested that the two compounds would adopt a similar pose in the ligand-binding pocket. Thus, a polar group (a carboxylic acid in (R)-KSI-6666 and a phosphate in W146) and a benzene ring (the internal benzene ring of (R)-KSI-6666 and the benzene ring of W146) overlapped, and the end of the hydrophobic moiety (CF<sub>3</sub>&#8211; in (R)-KSI-6666 and CH<sub>3</sub>&#8211; in W146) was in a similar position for the two inhibitors.</p><p id="Par18">We next performed MetaD simulation, which is used for biasing toward dissociation by applying external forces, to explore and compare the dissociation process from S1PR1 between (R)-KSI-6666 and W146. In total, 10 simulation runs for 100&#8201;ns each were performed for each compound. A plot of binding free-energy profiles (kcal/mol) against the distance of (R)-KSI-6666 (or W146) from the binding site in enhanced sampling using MetaD simulation suggested that a stable binding state of (R)-KSI-6666, but not of W146, may exist around 2&#8201;&#8491; away from the docking position (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Moreover, to evaluate the dissociation process, the root mean-square distance (RMSD) of (R)-KSI-6666 and W146 from the docking position was plotted against the simulation time. Assuming that the ligand was dissociated from S1PR1 when the RMSD was &gt;30&#8201;&#8491;, dissociation of W146 occurred in 7 of 10 runs by 100&#8201;ns from the start of the simulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), but dissociation of (R)-KSI-6666 occurred in only 4 of 10 runs. The visible inspection of MetaD data suggested that these ligands dissociate between helices I and VII, which is the same with other ligands of S1PR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, supporting the validity of the MetaD simulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>).

Overall, MetaD simulation suggested that (R)-KSI-6666 may be more resistant than W146 to dissociation from S1PR1.</p><p id="Par19">To verify the findings from MetaD simulation, binding and dissociation properties of KSI-6666 were determined experimentally by the functional reversibility assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Thus, inhibitory effect of KSI-6666 was evaluated by its resistance against ligand-inducing receptor internalization (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). After S1PR1-expressing cells were pretreated with KSI-6666 at various concentrations, serially diluted amounts of the agonistic FTY720-P were added (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The replacement of KSI-6666 with agonist FTY720-P on S1PR1 was monitored via the level of cellular surface S1PR1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). As described above, in the absence of the agonist, the addition of KSI-6666 caused a reduction of baseline activity due to the inverse agonistic activity (labeled &#8220;w/o&#8221; in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). As expected, the addition of FTY720-P or S1P ligand caused the replacement of KSI-6666 in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, however, the maximum agonist effect (E<sub>max</sub>) did not reach 100% when the pretreatment was with a high concentration of KSI-6666 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Furthermore, E<sub>max</sub> decreased with increasing concentrations of pretreated KSI-6666 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> right), but independent of the pre-incubation time (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). This phenomenon occurred for both agonists, FTY720-P and the natural ligand S1P. Moreover, the increment of GTP binding activity on agonist addition did not reach the maximum in the presence of a high concentration of KSI-6666 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This indicates that the replacement of KSI-6666 by the agonists was not complete in the assay.

As a result, our data suggests that the slow dissociation of KSI-6666 from S1PR1 is a key factor contributing to its in vivo persistent efficacy.

The frequency of bit entry for (R)-KSI-6666 relative to W146 was estimated.

To clarify this observation, the distance from Met124 (the &#947;-carbon atom) to the carbon atom of the CF<sub>3</sub>&#8211; group was compared with that from Met124 to a hydroxyl oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid in the zwitterionic moiety (hereafter referred to as O1) for the all selected poses in the MetaD trajectories (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). In the original structure determined by the docking study (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), the distances from Met124 were 10.1&#8201;&#8491; for CF<sub>3</sub>&#8211; and 9.3&#8201;&#8491; for O1. A correlation plot of the two distances in the simulation suggested that two major poses were present (named &#8220;gate A&#8221; and &#8220;gate B,&#8221; respectively, see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) besides scattered unbound poses.

Notably, the frequency of the poses in gate B decreased significantly in the MetaD simulation for the Val124 mutant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Overall, MetaD simulation suggested that a metastable binding state (hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Met pocket&#8221;) may be generated by the interaction of (R)-KSI-6666 with Met124.</p><p id="Par26">We next evaluated the time-dependent transition of (R)-KSI-6666 binding poses by plotting the distance between the CF<sub>3</sub>&#8211; group and Met124 in each run versus time. After starting the MetaD simulation from the docking position, (R)-KSI-6666 quickly moved to the Met pocket in seven runs (Runs 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Subsequently, (R)-KSI-6666 dissociated from the Met pocket in three runs (Run 3, 8, and 9); moved to another binding pocket close to the starting position (hereafter referred as to the &#8220;deep pocket&#8221;) in two runs (Runs 7 and 10); and stayed in the Met pocket in one run (Run 4). In Run 1, although the distal benzene ring moved out of the pocket, (R)-KSI-6666 was still bound to S1PR1. In the other three runs (Runs 2, 5, and 6), (R)-KSI-6666 was located in the deep pocket soon after starting the simulation. Thereafter, (R)-KSI-6666 stayed in the deep pocket in two of the runs (Runs 5 and 6). Finally, in Run 2, (R)-KSI-6666 dissociated from the deep pocket. As expected, for the Val124 mutant, (R)-KSI-6666 stayed in the deep pocket after starting the simulation and dissociated without entering the Met pocket, except in Run 8, in which it may have been temporarily located in the Met pocket from around 30 to 50&#8201;ns (Supplementary Movie&#160;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">The deep pocket and Met pocket were visualized based on MetaD data (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In the deep pocket, a large part of the (R)-KSI-6666 structure is located within the transmembrane region of S1PR1. In contrast, in the Met pocket, the zwitterionic part of (R)-KSI-6666 extends into the extracellular region of S1PR1. As expected, the distal benzene ring seems to closely associates with Met124 in the Met pocket, whereas in the deep pocket, the central benzene ring is in close proximity to Met124. Because the Met pocket appears to be positioned along the path of dissociating (R)-KSI-6666 from the deep pocket, its presence serves as a potential barrier to dissociation. Overall, these data suggest that Met124 may be involved in the formation of a metastable binding pocket, the Met pocket, for (R)-KSI-6666, and thereby could act as a &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; to limit the dissociation of (R)-KSI-6666 from S1PR1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The pseudoirreversible inhibition contributes to the persistent efficacy of KSI-6666</title><p id="Par28">Because the distal benzene ring of (R)-KSI-6666 may interact with Met124 in S1PR1 in the Met pocket, we experimentally tested if replacing substituents on the benzene ring with hydrogen atoms influenced the dissociation properties of KSI-6666.

Our data indicated that KSI-6666 is a pseudoirreversible inhibitor of S1PR1 due to its slow dissociation from the receptor. Previous studies proposed that slower dissociation of antagonists from receptors elicits longer and more potent inhibition of target molecules in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, based on a model using six parameters of pharmacokinetics and dissociation kinetics, Dahl et al. proposed that a persistent efficacy of a drug due to long drug-target residence time can occur when the binding dissociation kinetic is slower than the pharmacokinetics elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Data showed that the dissociation half-life of KSI-6666 from S1PR1 (9.41&#8201;h) was longer than that of the pharmacokinetics half-life (6.65&#8201;h). This suggests that the pseudoirreversible binding of KSI-6666 to S1PR1 would be a determinant in its persistent efficacy. Consistently, compound 4, which lacks substituents of the benzene ring in S1PR1, was not a pseudoirreversible inhibitor and did not exhibit persistent efficacy. However, it cannot yet be denied that the relatively long pharmacokinetics half-life of KSI-6666 also contributes to its persistent efficacy.</p><p id="Par30">The two-step induced fit model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> may explain the pseudoirreversible inhibition. In this model, stable binding of a drug with its target occurs via a two-step mechanism: in the first step, binding to the target forms an encounter complex; then, in the second step, a conformational change of the complex occurs and strengthens the drug binding to the target. In binding via the two-step induced fit mechanism, the residence time of a drug-target complex may be considerably augmented. MetaD simulation of KSI-6666 in the dissociation process from S1PR1 suggested the presence of another stable binding pose requiring residue Met124 (i.e., the &#8220;Met pocket&#8221;) in addition to the pose close to the original binding pose (i.e., the &#8220;deep pocket&#8221;). The replacement of Met124 with Val abolished the pseudoirreversible inhibition by KSI-6666 in vitro. Therefore, KSI-6666 possibly binds to S1PR1 via a two-step induced fit mechanism; it binds to the Met pocket in the first step, and then forms a stable binding structure in the deep pocket, resulting in pseudoirreversible inhibition of S1PR1.</p><p id="Par31">A previous study showed that the replacement of Met124 with Lys caused a severe reduction of S1PR1 activity in cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This finding suggests that the hydrophobicity of Met124 is critical for the formation of the binding pocket for the S1PR1 ligand. Our study showed that the replacement of Met124 with Val or Leu did not practically affect the activity of FTY720-P, but severely impaired the slow dissociation of KSI-6666. Thus, Met124 may play roles not only in the formation of a hydrophobic &#8220;wall&#8221; for the binding pocket but also as a &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; for the binding and unbinding processes of S1PR1 modulators.</p><p id="Par32">The benzene ring moiety in KSI-6666 appears to be critical for the interaction with Met124. S1PR1 modulators can be divided into two types: FTY720-based S1PR1 modulators, which have a flexible lipophilic chain, and structurally divergent ones, most of which have benzene rings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The S1PR1 modulators with benzene rings may use the interaction with Met124 to form stable interactions, which could result in slow dissociation. Future testing of this hypothesis may help in the design of new S1PR1 antagonists.</p><p id="Par33">S1PR modulator FTY720 has been used for the treatment of MS for more than a decade. FTY720 undergoes phosphorylated in the body, and phosphorylated form (FTY720-P) exerts its action through initial S1PR1 agonism and subsequent receptor downregulation, resulting in in vivo persistence of efficacy. The initial activation is known to cause bradycardia through the activation of S1PR1. Therefore, continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is recommended during the early phase after administration of FTY720. Another S1PR modulator, ozanimod, has fewer side effects and was approved for MS therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, ozanimod also has agonistic activity, thereby affecting heart function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. To avoid the side effects of S1PR modulator ascribed to the S1PR1 agonism, a competitive inhibitor of S1PR1 was developed. W146 was identified as a competitive antagonist of S1PR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> however, its persistency of efficacy was found to be low, as confirmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We here demonstrate that KSI-6666 is a competitive inhibitor with persistent efficacy in vivo, and its therapeutic efficacy on the mouse EAE model was comparable with FTY720. Notably, as expected, administration of KSI-6666 did not provoke bradycardia. Our study suggested that the pseudoirreversible activity of KSI-6666 contributes to its persistent efficacy. In addition to KSI-6666, NIBR-0213 was previously identified as another competitive antagonist with a persistent reduction of blood lymphocyte count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The authors concluded that the persistent effect of the NIBR-0213 is attributed to its long pharmacokinetics. Although the insurmountable activity of NIBR-0213 was not reported in this study, NIBR-0213 may also be a pseudoirreversible inhibitor due to its chemical structure consisting of benzene ring moieties, similar to KSI-6666, which could interact with Met124 in S1PR1 during the dissociation process.</p><p id="Par34">In addition to MS, new applications, such as treatment of ulcerative colitis, have been proposed for the S1PR1 agonists, ozanimod and etrasimod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In the present study, KSI-6666, a competitive antagonist, showed an efficacy comparable to functional antagonists in rodent colitis models as well as the EAE model. Accordingly, competitive S1PR1 antagonists with pseudoirreversible inhibition, such as KSI-6666, could potentially be applicable for the treatment of these inflammatory diseases in future.</p><p id="Par35">One limitation of this study is that the significance of Met124 was not demonstrated in vivo. Interestingly, an in vitro study suggested that the insurmountable activity of KSI-6666 was abolished in S1PR1, where Met124 was replaced by Val124. Since a genomic point mutation from A to G would change Met to Val, the in vivo effects of KSI-6666-like pseudoirreversible inhibitors, can be genetically variable. To confirm this, mice with a mutation in Met124 need to be established in future. Another limitation of our study is the absence of data regarding the dissociation kinetics and elimination kinetics in lymphoid organs, where KSI-6666 binds to S1PR1, inhibiting the egress of lymphocytes. Thus, in addition to the in vitro cell culture model, it is crucial to verify whether KSI-6666 exhibits slow dissociation from S1PR1 in a more physiological setting and to determine its elimination time from lymphoid organs. Consequently, conducting a detailed analysis of lymphoid organs from mice treated with KSI-6666 emerges as a significant avenue for future research.</p><p id="Par36">Computational prediction of drug-binding behavior and free energy may be used widely in the development of new drugs in the future. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics to gain insights into the structural basis of the persistent efficacy of KSI-6666. The MetaD simulation highlighted the importance of Met124, a hypothesis substantiated through subsequent experiments involving cell cultures and animal models. A limitation of our study was the rudimentary nature of the MD simulation used to predict the dissociation behavior of KSI-6666. Although our simulation suggested the obstructive role of Met124 in the dissociation process of KSI-6666, it should be noted that a more detailed simulation is required to predict the dissociation kinetics quantitatively.

The OPLS3e force field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> was used for the simulations. The long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method. All system setups were performed using Maestro. The MM-GBSA protocol (Schr&#246;dinger LLC) was used to calculate the binding free energy of ligands based on cMD trajectories, and the last 100&#8201;ns of 500-ns trajectory each was extracted and summed for the analysis. MetaD simulation is a widely used enhanced sampling method that allows the sampling of free-energy landscapes. In this simulation, we defined the biasing collective variables as the distance between the center of mass of the ligands and the ligand-binding residues (Tyr29, Lys34, Tyr98, Asn101, Ser105, Gly106, Thr109, Trp117, Arg120, Glu121, Met124, Phe125, Leu128, Ser192, Val194, Leu195, Pro196, Tyr198, Ile203, Cys206, Thr207, Phe210, Trp269, Leu272, Phe273, Leu276, Glu294, Leu297, Val298, Ala300 and Val301 for (R)-KSI-6666; Tyr29, Lys34, Tyr98, Asn101, Ser105, Gly106, Thr109, Trp117, Arg120, Glu121, Met124, Phe125, Leu128, Thr193, Val194, Leu195, Pro196, Ile203, Cys206, Thr207, Phe210, Trp269, Leu272, Phe273, Leu276, Glu294, Leu297, Ala300, and Val301 for W146). The initial Gaussian hill height was set at 0.3. The MetaD procedure for (R)-KSI-6666 in the M124V variant was identical to that for wild-type S1PR1. The model of M124V-S1PR1 was constructed using Maestro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Protein&#8211;ligand interaction fingerprint analysis</title><p id="Par55">PLIF analyses from MetaD trajectories were performed using the PLIF modules of MOE 2020.0901 (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Energy-based contacts, including side chain hydrogen bonds (donor or acceptor), backbone hydrogen bonds (donor or acceptor), solvent hydrogen bonds (donor or acceptor), ionic interactions, metal binding interactions, and &#960; interactions, and surface contact fingerprints, were employed. After the PLIFs had been generated based on 1000 snapshot structures (every 1&#8201;ns in ten independent 100-ns simulations) for each ligand, the probability of each bit occurring for each residue for (R)-KSI-6666 compared with W146 was calculated as Qb.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
