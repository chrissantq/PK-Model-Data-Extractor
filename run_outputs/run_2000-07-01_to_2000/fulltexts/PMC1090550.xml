The "standard human" PBPK parameters developed in previous applications is used. It is assumed that the blood and tissue binding is determined by simple partition into the tissue lipid, which is characterized by two previously determined set of parameters: 1) the value of the propofol oil/water partition coefficient; 2) the lipid fraction in the blood and tissues.

In addition to its clinical importance, propofol provides a valuable model for understanding the human pharmacokinetics of agents that are concentrated in fat. Propofol has an oil/water partition coefficient (K<sub>oil</sub>) of about 4700 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], one of the largest of any pharmacological agent. In comparison, the highly lipophilic volatile anesthetics, such as halothane, have a K<sub>oil </sub>of less than 300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because of this large fat partition, propofol is highly concentrated in adipose tissue where it has slow uptake and release kinetics.</p><p>This paper presents the first detailed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) description of human propofol pharmacokinetics. The model describes the pharmacokinetics in terms of realistic human parameters, such as the organ blood flow and the tissue/blood partition. The PBPK model is implemented in PKQuest, a new software routine that has now been applied to more than 25 different solutes with a wide range of pharmacokinetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The major limitation in most human PBPK models is the uncertainty in the values used for the tissue/blood partition coefficients, which cannot be directly measured and are usually based on uncertain extrapolations from animal measurements. In general, the tissue partition of solutes has a complex dependence on protein and lipid binding and can vary markedly from tissue to tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This means that the PBPK model is dependent on a large number of individual tissue partition coefficients that are not well characterized and, effectively, become adjustable model parameters. However, the highly fat soluble non-polar solutes, such as the volatile anesthetics, are a special case. Their tissue/blood partition is dominated by simple, non-specific partition into the tissue lipid. In a previous application of PKQuest to the volatile anesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it was shown that the water/tissue partition could be directly determined just from a knowledge of the fraction of lipid in the different tissues and the value of lipid/water partition coefficient (K<sub>oil</sub>). This means that once the tissue lipid fractions are known (which are not solute dependent), the tissue/blood partition coefficient for any solute of this type is completely characterized by knowledge of the just the one physical parameter, the K<sub>oil</sub>. The PBPK modeling of solutes of this type is not only greatly simplified, but one can have more confidence in the model predictions because of the elimination of most of the adjustable parameters.</p><p>It is assumed here that this same approach can be applied to propofol. The tissue/blood partition coefficient is equal to the ratio of the tissue/water and blood/water partition:</p><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="1471-2253-5-4-i1.gif"/></p><p>The tissue/water partition is determined from the fraction of lipid in the tissue and the K<sub>oil </sub>of propofol. The blood/water partition is determined from experimental measurements of the fraction of propofol that is free (unbound) in blood &#8211; defined by the parameter freepl.. Since there is large individual variation in the value of freepl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] one might regard it as an adjustable parameter that varied from subject to subject. However, it was found that the PBPK model adequately predicted the individual results using one average value of freepl for all subjects. Only one parameter was adjusted for each subject &#8211; the intrinsic liver clearance. All the other PBPK parameters are identical to those that have been used previously in the application of PKQuest to a variety of solutes. A detailed description of the propofol PBPK model is provided in the Methods Section.</p><p>This PBPK model is evaluated by applying it to the experimental data of Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This data describes the arterial pharmacokinetics of propofol in 24 healthy volunteers with ages varying from 24&#8211;81 years, and at 4 different doses. Each subject was given an initial bolus dose, followed 60 minutes later by a constant 60-minute infusion. In the original publication, the pharmacokinetics for the constant infusion phase was interpreted in terms of a 6 parameter compartmental model using NONMEM. Surprisingly, the kinetic parameters from the constant infusion phase were poor predictors of the kinetics following the bolus injection in the same subject. This suggested that there was some systematic difference between the bolus and infusion kinetics, and effects such as early recirculation, a propofol induced change in liver blood flow or pulmonary sequestration were listed as possible explanations. This new PBPK analysis suggests that pulmonary sequestration is the major factor responsible for this discrepancy. The propofol is formulated as a lipid emulsion because it has a low aqueous solubility. In some subjects, a significant fraction of the bolus emulsion (0 &#8211; 60%) is sequestered in its first pass through the lung, and then slowly released. When a quantitative model (with two additional adjustable parameters) of this sequestration is incorporated into the PBPK model, a single set of PBPK parameters provides a good description of both the bolus and constant infusion phases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental data</title><p>The methodology for the data collection and analysis was described in detail in the previous publication of Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Briefly, 24 volunteers in 3 age groups (18&#8211;34; 35&#8211;65; and &gt;65 years) of 8 each were selected. The individual subjects will be identified as, eg, Subject # 1&#8211;5 where the first number refers to the age group (1: 18&#8211;34 years, etc.) and the second number is the individual number for that group. Each subject was given an initial bolus (&#8776; 20 second) dose (2 mg/kg for subjects &lt; 65; 1 mg/kg for subjects &gt;65) followed 60 minutes later by a constant 60 minute infusion of 25, 50, 100 or 200 &#956;g/kg/min. Arterial blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 60, 62, 64, 68, 76, 90, 120, 122, 124, 136, 150, 180, 240, 300 and 600 minutes and the arterial plasma propofol concentration was determined. Each subject was studied on two separate visits, using either propofol with or without EDTA under otherwise identical infusion conditions. Since there was no significant difference with or without EDTA, the data from these two experiments were averaged and were used as the individual data that was fitted with the PBPK model.</p><p>The percent body fat for each subject was determined using the regression equation of Gallagher et. al.

The model parameters (organ blood flow, volume, etc.) are identical to those used in previous applications of PKQuest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The connective tissue is divided between two organs: "tendon" with a relatively low blood flow, and "other" with a higher blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The PBPK values for the tissue weight, blood flow and fraction lipid are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. A major limitation of this PBPK analysis is that a constant set of "standard human" resting organ blood flow is assumed and any hemodynamic changes associated with the uptake and washout of propofol are ignored. The experimental observation that cardiac output is either unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or only slightly decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with short term propofol supports this assumption. However, Sellgren et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported that propofol produced large changes in peripheral blood flow which would suggest that there may be a significant redistribution in the organ blood flow that is ignored in this PBPK model.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the PBPK model.

Since the plasma propofol concentration was measured in the experiments of Schnider et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the whole blood model concentrations were first converted to the equivalent plasma concentration before the model results were output in the plots of plasma model concentration versus experimental data.</p></sec><sec><title>Standard value for human propofol free plasma concentration fraction (freepl<sub>st</sub>) and blood/plasma ratio (rblpl<sub>st</sub>)</title><p>As discussed above, the tissue/blood partition depends on the value of the fraction free in plasma (freepl). Experimental measurements of the normal human free plasma propofol fraction (freepl) fall into two different ranges. The smaller value of about 0.01 comes from a series of publications by Suarez and colleagues using ultrafiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A larger value of about 0.02 has been reported by several other research groups: Using equilibrium dialysis, Altmayer et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported values ranging from 0.014 to 0.026 and Servin et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reported an average value of 0.022; while Mazoit and Samii [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] report an average value of about 0.02 using a charcoal co-binding technique. All reports agree that the plasma binding is independent of propofol concentration in the clinical concentration range and that the normal individual variation is about &#177; 40% of the mean. Although the difference in these measurements of the freepl<sub>st </sub>(0.01 versus 0.02) is small in absolute value, it has a dramatic effect on the pharmacokinetics &#8211; producing a roughly two-fold difference in the tissue/blood partition coefficient (eq. (4)). Since the PBPK analysis (see below) is consistent with a value of about 0.022, this was the value that was assumed for standard values for freepl (freepl<sub>st</sub>). The reported values for the normal human blood/plasma ratio (rblpl<sub>st</sub>) vary from 1.1 to 1.3: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and a standard value of the blood/plasma ratio (rblpl<sub>st</sub>) of 1.0 was assumed.</p><p>Because of the large (40%) individual variation in freepl, it might be regarded as an adjustable parameter that varied from subject to subject. However, since it was found that there was no significant improvement of the PBPK model fit to the individual data when freepl was allowed to vary, in the following analysis it is assumed that all subjects had a freepl of 0.022. Using eqs. (4) &#8211; (7), the corresponding normal model values for the tissue/blood partition coefficients using the value of v<sub>f</sub><sup>i </sup>in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> are: adipose 84; brain 1.87; liver 2.12; intestine 1.7 and the rest 1.45. These values are in the same range as the experimental measurements of Weaver et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] after a 2 hour constant infusion in sheep: brain 1.8 &#8211; 2.4; kidney 1.36 &#8211; 1.85; skeletal muscle 0.68 &#8211; 1.4 (the range corresponds to the values for 2 different infusion rates). Assuming that the propofol binding in blood is produced entirely by partitioning between the blood lipid and water, the freepl value of 0.022 corresponds to a value for the fraction of lipid in whole blood (v<sub>f</sub><sup>blood</sup>) of about 0.0093 (using eq. (5)), which is in the range of the normal human blood total lipid (total plasma lipid of 0.0082 gm/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and blood/plasma lipid ratio of 1).</p></sec><sec><title>PBPK description of propofol metabolism</title><p>It is assumed that the kinetics of all the tissues are described by a flow limited, well mixed model, except for the liver, which is described using the "Dispersion" model of Rowland and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] with a dispersion coefficient of 0.3. Measurements of brain, arterial and venous propofol concentrations during infusions in sheep are consistent with a flow limited, well mixed model for the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This well-mixed tissue assumption is only correct as a first approximation and there is some evidence that it may not be rigorously correct for muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Since the kinetic analysis of Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] of the data analyzed in this paper indicated that the kinetics were linear over the constant infusion range (25 to 200 &#956;g/kg/min) that was investigated, a linear PBPK model is used. It is assumed that the propofol removal is entirely the result of liver metabolism and is described by the intrinsic liver clearance (Tclr), defined by:</p><p>(8) &#160;&#160;&#160; <italic>Q(x)dx = Tclr c(x) dx</italic></p><p>where Q is the rate of liver metabolism (amount/min) and c is the free liver tissue concentration. Since a dispersion model is used for the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the metabolism varies as a function of distance (x) from the start of the liver sinusoid. For the subjects investigated in this paper, Tclr varies from about 65 to 400 liters/min/70 Kg human. Although Tclr has units of clearance it is not equal to the actual liver whole blood clearance for two reasons. First, the concentration term in eq. (8) is the free liver concentration, not the whole blood concentration. The effective clearance from the blood (Tclr<sub>blood</sub>) is related to Tclr approximately by:</p><p>(9) &#160;&#160;&#160; <italic>Tclr<sub>blood </sub>= (water / blood partition) Tclr </italic>&#8776; 0.02 <italic>Tclr</italic></p><p>A second, more complicated, correction arises from the position dependence in eq.

This sequestration is described by two parameters: 1) frdose &#8211; the fraction of the dose that is sequestered; and 2) T &#8211; the time constant of the exponential release from the lung of the sequestered fraction. The rate of release from the lung (R(t)) of the sequestered propofol after the bolus input is described by:</p><p>(11) &#160;&#160;&#160; <italic>R<sub>bolus </sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = (1/<italic>T</italic>) <italic>Dose frdose </italic>exp(-<italic>t / T</italic>)</p><p>This sequestration was incorporated into the PBPK model simply by dividing the bolus input into two non-sequestered components: 1) A bolus input of Dose &#215; (1-frdose); and 2) An exponential input of total amount = Dose &#215; frdose.</p><p>The data was also analyzed to check whether there was sequestration of the constant infusion dose. This required a more complicated modification. The constant infusion was again divided into two components. The first, non-sequestered, component was just a constant infusion of Dose &#215; (1-frdose). For the second, sequestered component, it was assumed that a fraction frdose of the constant infusion was accumulated in a well-mixed compartment in the lung that was released with the same exponential time course as the bolus dose. The release for the bolus dose (eq. (11)) corresponds to the bolus response function of this sequestering lung compartment. Thus, the rate of release (R<sub>I</sub>(t)) for an arbitrary input I(t) to this sequestering compartment is equal to the convolution of I(t) and R<sub>bolus</sub>(t):</p><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="1471-2253-5-4-i9.gif"/></p><p>This input is pre-programmed into PKQuest as one of the input options and is invoked simply by calling this input option.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of PBPK parameters</title><p>Each subject in the study was given a bolus propofol injection followed 60 minutes later by a constant 60 minute infusion and the PBPK model was used to fit the individual concentration curves. The previously determined "standard human" PBPK parameter set (organ blood flow, volume, etc., see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was used for all subjects. The tissue/blood partition was determined from eqs. (4)&#8211;(7) using a freepl = 0.022, a blood/plasma ratio of 1 and the tissue lipid fractions determined previously (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The values of these standard parameters depend on the percent body fat, which is determined using eq. (2).</p><p>For each subject the intrinsic liver clearance was adjusted to fit the data. For some subjects, in order to fit the bolus phase it was also necessary to choose the two parameters describing the pulmonary sequestration (frdose and T). Several steps were used to determine these parameters for each subject: 1) Subjectively adjust the liver clearance (Tclr) to fit the constant infusion phase. 2) If both the bolus and constant infusion phase could be adequately fit by one value of the liver clearance, than it was assumed that there was no pulmonary sequestration and step 3 was implemented. In 14 of the 24 subjects, no pulmonary sequestration was required. In the other 10 subjects it was necessary to adjust frdose and T to fit the bolus phase. Depending on the value of T, the slow release from the sequestered compartment can extend into the constant infusion phase, and it was necessary to repeat this cycle of parameter estimation. 3) Finally, a 1-parameter Powel non-linear minimization routine in PKQuest was used to find the value of Tclr that provided the best fit to the entire experimental concentration curve (bolus plus constant infusion) for that subject. This used a weighted least square minimization technique with weights determined by assuming that the standard deviation of the measurement was proportional to the model concentration.</p><p>The experimental plasma concentration was collected over a time course of 0 to 600 minutes, with the first data points at 1, 2, 4 ... minutes and the last two samples at 300 and 600 minutes. Because of mixing and circulation time effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the PBPK model is not accurate at times &lt; 2 minutes, so that the first point that was used in the analysis was at 2 minutes. The fits to the 600 minute data was less accurate than for the earlier data points (see figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The 600 minute data point has the most scatter because the status of the subjects was not controlled during the 300 to 600 minute time period and ambulation or food intake during this period could produce large shifts in the PBPK parameters, particularly muscle, liver and fat blood flow. The quality of the fits were quantitated and compared with the 6 parameter NONMEM fit by the use of the "weighted residual error" (WRE) defined as the average value of the absolute (measured &#8211; model)/model concentration ratio</p><p>All the calculations and the graphical output were implemented using the PKQuest software routine.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] in which the pharmacokinetics of normal weight and morbidly obese subjects were compared. The average values were used for the fraction free in plasma (freepl = 0.022) and intrinsic liver clearance (Tclr = 162 liters/min/70 kg). This value of Tclr corresponds to a steady state liver clearance of 1.49 liters/min or 83% of the total liver flow for the standard 70 kg man (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Results were compared for normal weight subjects (fat fraction = 20%) and for the average obese subject studied by Servin et. al. Using the reported body weight and ideal body weight of the obese subjects, it was estimated that they had a fat fraction of about 50% based on the regression relationship of Rhode et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] that 69% of the weight greater than ideal weight is fat.</p><p>One significant change was made in the PBPK parameters for the obese subjects. Adipose blood flow is heterogeneous, with the highest values in subcutaneous tissue and lower values in visceral and perirenal fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It is probable that morbidly obese subjects have a lower average adipose blood flow then normal weight subjects. An estimate of the adipose blood flow can be obtained from the relationship between cardiac output and excess body weight. The cardiac output measurements in morbidly obese subjects of Alexander et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] were used to estimate an average adipose tissue blood flow of 0.03 liters/kg, 28% less than the standard value of 0.042 liters/kg (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All the other PBPK parameters are identical for the normal and obese subjects. Since it is assumed in PKQuest that liver weight is a constant fraction of non-fat body weight, the obese subjects have a lower relative liver weight and, therefore, a lower rate of propofol clearance per kg body weight. Servin et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] used a stepwise infusion regimen: 0.35 mg/kg/min for 5 minutes, 0.2 mg/kg/min for 10 minutes, and 0.1 mg/kg/min for the remainder of the 180 minute infusion. In the simulation, a constant 0.1 mg/kg/min infusion for the entire 180 minutes was assumed.

This same discrepancy in the model prediction was noted in the original analysis of this data by Schnider et. al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] using a NONMEM compartmental model. It is impossible to explain this deviation using the standard PBPK model. Any variation that improves the fit to the bolus phase significantly worsens the fit to the constant infusion phase.</p><p>This deviation between theory and experiment could be explained if part of the bolus dose was sequestered in the lung and then slowly released.

It was clearly recognized in the original analysis of this data by Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that there was some systematic difference between the kinetics for these two different inputs. Schnider et. al. fit the constant infusion phase kinetics for each subject with a 6 parameter NONMEM model. When these kinetic parameters for the infusion phase were used to fit the initial bolus kinetics, the predicted concentrations for the early time points (2 to 4 minutes) were about 50% greater then the experimental values, while the predicted concentration for the later data points (&gt;8 minutes) were about 50% less than the experimental values. The same systematic difference is seen in the younger subjects when the PBPK parameters for the constant infusion phase are used to predict the concentration following the bolus dose (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Pulmonary sequestration of the bolus dose with a slow release provides an explanation of this systematic difference. The sequestration will reduce the concentration of the early time points and, as the sequestered dose is slowly released, increase the concentration of the later time points. A simple model in which a fraction (frdose) of the bolus dose is sequestered and is then released as a single exponential (eq. (11)) provides a good fit to the experimental data (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, and figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The fraction of the dose that was sequestered was largest in the younger age group, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>As described in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, there does not seem to be any significant sequestration when the propofol is given as a constant infusion because its subsequent slow release would produce a significant deviation of the model predictions from the observed experimental data. This suggests that the sequestration depends on the concentration of the emulsion when it is mixed with the venous blood at the injection site. The bolus injection rate of 140 mg/70 kg/20 sec propofol in Diprivan corresponds to an injection of about 4.2 gm/min of lipid into the vein of a 70 kg man. In contrast, the highest rate of constant infusion (14 mg/70 kg/min) represents a 30-fold lower infusion rate.</p><p>There is direct experimental evidence for pulmonary sequestration of propofol following a bolus injection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. He et. al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] simultaneously injected propofol and indocyanine green (ICG) in a central vein and sampled radial arterial blood at 1 second intervals for a period of 1 minute &#8211; the first pass time. They injected 5 mg/70 kg propofol within 1 second &#8211; about twice the rate of the bolus injection of Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that was fit with the PBPK model. A first pass pulmonary clearance of propofol of about 28% was estimated from the difference in the first pass AUC of propofol and ICG. This analysis cannot distinguish between pulmonary metabolism versus sequestration. However, in the same study, He et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the radial and pulmonary artery concentrations during a 60 minute constant infusion, indicating that propofol is neither metabolized nor sequestered during a constant infusion.</p><p>In the standard propofol formulation (Diprivan), the propofol is dissolved in a lipid emulsion that is identical to the emulsion (Intralipid) that is used for parenteral feeding. There is also direct evidence that Intralipid is sequestered in the human pulmonary circulation. Zauner et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] measured the brachial artery &#8211; pulmonary artery concentration difference of Intralipid during and after a constant infusion. At high rates of Intralipid infusion (about 6.5 times the maximum rate used by Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) they observed a significant pulmonary sequestration of about 20% during the infusion, with a subsequent release of the sequestered Intralipid that persisted for at least 15 minutes after stopping the infusion. In addition, Gigon et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] found fat in the lumen of pulmonary capillaries in human lung biopsies a few minutes after beginning Intralipid infusion.</p><p>There are large individual variations in the model predictions of the fraction of the dose that is sequestered, varying from 0 to 60%. All of the younger subjects had some sequestration (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) with a median value of about 30%. Only two of the eight middle-aged subjects (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and none of the subjects in the oldest group (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) had significant sequestration. This variation cannot be explained by experimental variations in the bolus infusion rate, which was carefully controlled. The lack of sequestration in the oldest subjects might be explained, in part, because they received only half the bolus dose of the other two groups. Variation in sequestration could result in significant variations in the pharmacodynamic effect of a bolus propofol injection.</p><p>This new evidence supporting the concept of pulmonary sequestration is indirect since it is based just on an analysis of the PBPK model. There clearly is a need for more direct experimental measurements to either confirm or rule out this effect. In addition, the predicted differences in the magnitude of the sequestration between the young and middle-aged subjects is a surprising result and one that requires further documentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Validity of the PBPK propofol model</title><p>The PBPK model (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) requires assumptions about a large number of physiological parameters, such as tissue volumes and flows, and is limited by many simplifying assumptions, such as that the tissue regions are well stirred (except for the liver) and flow limited. The usual criticism of the PBPK approach is that, since it uses a large number of adjustable "physiological" parameters that cannot be directly measured, it becomes, in effect, a glorified compartmental model. This criticism applies particularly to the tissue/blood partition coefficients of the different organs, which are impossible to directly measure in humans. The major goal in the development of PKQuest is to address this criticism by the development of a "standard human" PBPK data set whose values have been refined by application to more than 25 different solutes with a wide range of pharmacokinetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>This propofol PBPK analysis uses the previously determined "standard human" data set for the organ volumes and blood flows so that these parameters are no longer "adjustable". Because of the very high propofol fat partition, the tissue/blood partition is dominated by the partition into the tissue and blood fat. In this PBPK analysis, the tissue/blood partition was directly determined using the tissue fat fractions that were derived in a previous PBPK analysis of the volatile anesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] along with the experimental value for the propofol fraction unbound in blood (freepl = 0.022), and no other assumptions or adjustable parameters were required. Thus, in this PBPK model there is only one new adjustable parameter required to completely describe the blood concentration curves &#8211; the intrinsic liver clearance. (Two additional parameters are required to describe the sequestration of the bolus dose in some subjects).</p><p>The very high fat solubility of propofol makes it an ideal candidate for a PBPK model. The partition of propofol in tissue fat dominates the tissue/blood partition coefficient, allowing one to estimate the tissue/blood partition simply from knowledge of the tissue fat fraction. For other less fat soluble solutes, the tissue/blood partition cannot be predicted by this a priori approach, and the number of poorly characterized adjustable PBPK parameters is markedly increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of PBPK and compartment models</title><p>Although compartmental and PBPK models are often regarded as competitors, they are actually complementary and serve different purposes. Compartment models, as implemented in NONMEM, provide an unbiased parametric description of a data set using a using a minimal number of model assumptions. If one is only interested in a parametric description of a given clinical data set, then this is all that is needed. The limitation of the compartment model is that the parameters are only weakly related to physiological variables. One cannot use a compartment model to predict the pharmacokinetics under varying physiological conditions, such as changes in portal, muscle or fat blood flow, or variations in plasma protein binding or body fat content.</p><p>This paper describes one of the few quantitative comparisons of PBPK and compartmental models that is available in the literature. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> compares the average weighted residual percent error (WRE) for each subject using the 6 parameter NONMEM compartment model versus the 1 parameter PBPK model (for some subjects 2 additional parameters are required to fit the bolus phase). The WRE for the compartment model are for the fits to just the constant infusion phase, while the WRE for the PBPK model is for both the bolus and infusion phase. The quality of the fits for the PBPK model is slightly poorer than that for the NONMEM compartmental model (compartment model: 14.18% error; PBPK model: 15.0% error).</p><p>The clinically important measure of the quality of the fit is how well it predicts the kinetics using "averaged" parameters without any prior information about the individual model parameters. Two different "averaged" errors were reported for the NONMEM model (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The error was 23% when an identical "optimal" set of 6 parameters was used for all subjects. The error was reduced to 17.39% when 5 "covariate" parameters were used that were based on the subjects' sex, weight, height and age. The ability to calculate these covariate parameters is one of the major strengths of NONMEM compartmental modeling. Although some PBPK models have been developed that allow Bayesian population modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], this is not possible with the current version of PKQUEST. Thus, it is not possible to determine the covariate dependence of the PBPK model parameter (Tclr, frdose, T) on subject's age, weight, etc. The only correlation that was investigated for the PBPK model was the age dependence of the parameters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The only parameter with significant age dependence was the pulmonary sequestration fraction (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Using this linear age dependent correlation (eq. (13)) an "averaged" PBPK model fit was obtained for all subjects (figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). These calculations also include a limited correlation for sex, age, weight and height through the use of an estimate of each subject's percent body fat using eq. (2). For the PBPK model, the "average" error was 20.0%, significantly worse than the covariate NONMEM model error of 17.39%. It should be emphasized that the PBPK model error is for both the bolus and constant infusion phases, while the NONMEM error is for just the constant infusion phase.</p><p>An important limitation of the NONMEM compartmental approach is that, since it is only a parametric description of a particular data set, errors may occur when the model is extrapolated beyond this data set. This is clearly illustrated for propofol if one tries to extrapolate the compartmental model to times longer than those used in the experimental data set (10 hours). The time constant (T) for equilibration with adipose tissue is described by:</p><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="1471-2253-5-4-i11.gif"/></p><p>For an adipose blood flow of 0.042 ml/gm/min and an adipose/blood partition coefficient of 84, T is 2000 minutes, or 33.3 hours. Accurate estimates of steady state clearance (Cl<sub>ss</sub>) and volume of distribution (V<sub>ss</sub>) require that the kinetics be determined for times of about twice that of the longest time constant, eg. about 50 hours. Most kinetic studies are for periods much shorter than this and have led to misleading values for these parameters. This is clearly illustrated by the NONMEM compartmental analysis of Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Based on measurements for a 10 hour sample period, they found a V<sub>ss </sub>of about 260 liters, about 10 times less than the V<sub>ss </sub>of 1200 to 3940 liters obtained by Campbell et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], Morgan et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and Albanese et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] using plasma values sampled for times varying from 40 to 100 hours. In addition, Schnider et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] estimated a Cl<sub>ss </sub>of 1.89 liters/min, significantly larger than the experimental estimates of Campbell et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and Morgan et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] of 1.02 to 1.6 liters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, a much better estimate of V<sub>ss </sub>and Cl<sub>ss </sub>is obtained using the PBPK model. For the standard human (20% fat) the V<sub>ss </sub>for the PBPK model is about 1500 liters, of which about 97% is contributed by the adipose tissue. For body fat varying from 12% to 40%, the PBPK model V<sub>ss </sub>varies from 980 to 3000 liters, in good agreement with the experimental measurements of Campbell et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and Morgan et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The intrinsic clearance, Tclr, (eq. (8)), varies from about 70 to 500 liters/min with a median value of about 160 liters/min (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). This corresponds to a median value for the steady state liver clearance of about 1.49 liters/min/70 kg, with a range of 1 to 1.8 liters/min (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), which, again, is similar to what is observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>A direct comparison of the PBPK and NONMEM model predictions is shown in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> (standard male, 21% body fat) and fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref> (obese female, 47% body fat). The PBPK model used the average Tclr value for the young subjects (Tclr = 165) with the body fat determined using the subjects age, weight and height (eq. (2)). The top row compares the model predictions for a 1-hour constant infusion followed by a 9-hour washout. Both models give very similar results over this limited washout time. This is expected since this is the time period for which the NONMEM and PBPK parameters were optimized. The differences in the two models become dramatic if the washout is extended to 49 hours (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, middle row), long enough for differences in the value of V<sub>ss </sub>to become important.

As can be seen in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>, for the standard male (21% fat) the predicted steady state plasma value using the NONMEM model is about 19% less than that for the PBPK model using the "correct" value of V<sub>ss</sub>.

The primary application of the PBPK approach has been in the field of toxicokinetics where the ability to predict the kinetics under varying physiological conditions is critical (for a recent review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]). The usefulness of these PBPK predictions is critically dependent on having confidence that the PBPK model is not just a set of adjustable parameters but, instead, represents a true "physiologically based model" that can be extrapolated to conditions that are different from those that were used to derive the model parameters. The fact that this propofol PBPK model has just one new adjustable parameter (liver clearance), helps to justify this confidence.</p><p>This section will focus on one physiological variable &#8211; the body fat fraction. The property that most distinguishes the propofol kinetics is its very high oil/water partition coefficient of about 4715. The corresponding adipose/blood partition coefficient is about 84 (eq. (4) which results in a huge volume of distribution, about 2000 liters/70 kg, of which about 97% is in the adipose tissue. One might expect that the body fat content should have a large influence on the kinetics. However, Servin et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] compared the propofol kinetics for normal weight and morbidly obese subjects during standard surgical anesthesia (180 minute constant infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min followed by an 8 hour washout) and showed that the differences in the two groups of subjects was small. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref> shows a PBPK model simulation of the experiments of Servin et. al. (see Methods for details). The black line is for a normal subject (20% body fat) and the red is for the average morbidly obese subject (50% body fat). Servin et. al. followed the washout for 8 hours after stopping the infusion (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>, top panel). It can be seen that over most of the infusion and washout period, the concentrations in the obese subjects differs by less than 30% from that for the normal subjects, which is small compared to the inter-individual variation in the experimental study of Servin et. al. Thus, this model simulation is consistent with the main conclusion of Servin et. al. that variations in body fat content have relatively small effects on the propofol kinetics during standard surgical procedures. However, if the washout is followed for 5 days, a period that is long compared to the 33 hour adipose time constant, the difference in kinetics for the obese subjects becomes dramatic (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>, bottom panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><p>Comparison of arterial blood concentration in normal weight (black) and morbidly obese subjects (red).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] for the obese subjects is that they woke up significantly faster than the normal weight subjects after stopping the propofol infusion. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref> shows the first 20 minutes of the washout period after the 180-minute propofol infusion. Servin et. al. recorded the time and arterial blood concentration of first eye opening. The eye opening arterial blood concentration was the same for obese and normal subjects (about 1 mg/l; fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref>, dashed line). The model simulation in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref> predicts an eye opening time of about 5 minutes for the obese subjects and 13 minutes for the normal subjects. This is qualitatively similar to what was observed by Servin et. al. (obese: 10.3 &#177; 6.3 minutes; normal: 18.4 &#177; 5.7 minutes).</p><fig position="float" id="F15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption><p>Comparison of time for eye opening after a 180 minute constant infusion in normal weight (black) and morbidly obese subjects (red).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">16</xref> shows the model simulation of the arterial concentration for a 10-day constant infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min in normal weight and morbidly obese subjects. It can be seen that for these long-term infusions, the pharmacokinetics in obese subjects differs significantly from normal subjects. In normal weight subjects the arterial concentration reaches a steady state value after about 3 days, while in the obese subjects the arterial concentration is still rising at the end of the 10 day infusion. The arterial propofol rises to a higher concentration in the obese subjects because the same dose/kg was given to both subjects, while the obese subject has a lower rate of liver metabolism/kg because of the assumption of a constant liver weight per lean body mass. Probably the most important clinical implication of this model analysis is the prediction the kinetics of the washout phase after long-term sedation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">17</xref> shows the model simulation of the first 60 minutes of washout after a 10 day constant infusion. The infusion rate has been adjusted so that the normal and obese subjects have identical arterial concentrations just before the infusion is stopped. Sixty minutes after stopping the infusion the arterial concentration in obese subjects has dropped to a value of only 65% of the 10-day value, versus 45% in normal subjects. This suggests that blood concentrations during long-term infusions in obese subjects must be carefully monitored to assure rapid awakening when the infusion is terminated.</p><fig position="float" id="F16"><label>Figure 16</label><caption><p>Comparison of arterial blood concentration in normal weight (black) and morbidly obese subjects (red).
