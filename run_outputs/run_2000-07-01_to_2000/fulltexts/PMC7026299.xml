Left untreated, there is a high risk of progression to end-stage liver disease. Few treatment options exist. To date, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA) are the only medical therapies approved for use, other than symptomatic treatments and liver transplantation, the latter of which is reserved for those developing complications of cirrhosis or with intractable pruritus. UDCA improves outcomes, but many patients do not adequately respond. OCA therapy may improve response, but long-term data are limited. New therapies are desperately needed, but evaluation has been limited by the fact that the disease is heterogeneous, hard end points take years to develop, and there are different criteria in use for determining therapeutic response based on surrogate biomarkers. Fibrates appear to be the most promising new therapy and have beneficially affected surrogate end points and are beginning to show improvement in clinical end points.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Primary biliary cholangitis</kwd><kwd>Ursodeoxycholic acid</kwd><kwd>Obeticholic acid</kwd><kwd>Fibrate</kwd><kwd>Liver disease</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Japanese Society of Gastroenterology 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an uncommon cholestatic liver disease predominantly affecting women with an overall prevalence of 6&#8211;402 per million persons; incidence may be on the rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The age of onset is typically in the fourth or fifth decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The exact pathophysiologic basis for the development of PBC is yet to be fully elucidated; however, evidence supports an autoimmune-induced mechanism. This is supported by the presence of a hallmark autoantibody: anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), in nearly all PBC patients. Genetic risk and environmental exposures have also been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Diagnosis of PBC</title><p id="Par3">Diagnosis of PBC relies on fulfillment of two of three hallmark criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These include a persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the absence of other hepatobiliary pathology, detection of a positive anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and/or a liver biopsy with characteristic findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">After identification of an elevated ALP, assessment should be made to detect the presence or absence of an elevated AMA. AMA is the hallmark antibody of PBC, and is found in over 95% of patients with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Approximately, 5% of PBC patients will lack a detectable AMA. Biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis and may be reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion but negative AMA, or to exclude coexistent liver disease such as autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p id="Par5">Histologically, PBC is characterized by non-suppurative inflammation of the small intrahepatic bile ducts. An inflammatory infiltrate is seen around the small intrahepatic bile ducts. The classic histologic finding is a florid duct lesion <bold>(</bold>Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but it is only present in a minority of histologic samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There is a spectrum of histologic changes. Over time, however, there is relatively slow progression from inflammatory to fibrotic change with the development of cirrhosis typically occurring within approximately 1 to 2 decades from diagnosis. However, there is wide variation in clinical presentation and course. Left untreated, there is variable progression to end-stage liver disease. While there is no cure, current treatments have been shown to delay or reduce the risk of end-stage liver disease and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. <fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Histologic features of PBC with overlap. The image demonstrates a classic &#8220;florid duct lesion&#8221; of PBC. Typically, a biopsy is not required to make the diagnosis of PBC. In this particular case, a 70-year-old woman presented with a long-standing alkaline phosphatase elevation 2&#8211;3 times the upper limit of normal. AMA testing was negative, but ANA was markedly positive at 4.6 units. Abdominal ultrasound was pursued showing findings suspicious for cirrhosis, but no bile duct anomaly. Diagnostic liver biopsy was pursued. Interestingly, the case demonstrates an overlap syndrome as well, given the presence of interface hepatitis. This highlights the need for diagnostic liver biopsy in cases of AMA-negative but suspected PBC, and when there is concern for an overlap syndrome. It further highlights the utility of ANA assessment in patients suspected of PBC</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="535_2020_1664_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Need for additional treatment options</title><p id="Par6">PBC carries increased risk of morbidity and mortality as well as reduced indicators of quality of life. Medical treatments for PBC are relatively new, having become available in the last 30&#160;years. Until recently, 2016, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a synthetic bile acid, the efficacy of which will be described in full detail later in this manuscript, was the only approved medical therapy for PBC. The identification of UDCA as PBC treatment was a monumental breakthrough in medical science, but unfortunately approximately one-third of PBC patients lack an adequate biochemical response defined as a reduction in the surrogate biomarker ALP to less than 40% of baseline or less than 1.67&#8211;2 times the upper limit of normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is the newest approved treatment, which will also be discussed later, but lacks long-term follow up on safety and efficacy. Liver transplantation has been used for the treatment of PBC-related cirrhosis, disease refractory to control by UDCA or OCA and when symptomatic treatments fail to control pruritus, but carries the real risk of transplant-related morbidity and mortality and is thus reserved only for those patients who have progressed to cirrhosis with significant liver dysfunction to warrant the surgical risk and long-term risks inherent to organ transplantation or for those patients who have developed liver-related malignancy attributed to cirrhosis or with refractory pruritus. Interestingly, even liver transplant does not appear to &#8220;cure&#8221; PBC. A small study showed that as many as 75% of patients may develop recurrent disease after transplant, though the severity of the recurrence is usually of little clinical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pitfalls in developing clinical trials for PBC</title><p id="Par7">There is a clear need for the development of new agents to treat PBC, but progress has been overall slow. One of the likely explanations for the difficulty in developing new and effective agents is the lack of a clear understanding of what drives the pathology of PBC. PBC is thought to progress through three phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The first is an autoimmune phase with resultant immune-mediated inflammation and damage to bile ducts. This chronic persistent damage leads to cholestasis. Bile acids are toxic to the hepatobiliary cells over time. This further drives hepatocellular inflammation. Hepatocellular and cholangio-cellular death leads to ductopenia and irreversible biliary fibrosis and cirrhosis. The difficulty in finding treatments is that many potential targets have been identified, but bile acid metabolism is complex and necessary for normal hepatic function. Complete blockage of function is not possible, as normal bile acid metabolism and homeostasis are necessary for life.</p><p id="Par8">Furthermore, from a clinical standpoint, PBC represents a heterogeneous disease. While predominantly affecting middle-aged Caucasian females who possess a positive AMA, it can present in other populations and with differences in clinical severity. It is debatable whether AMA-negative and AMA-positive biliary cholangitis even represent the same disease entity, though there appears to be a genetic association. Younger age of onset and male gender as well as African and Hispanic descent portend a poorer prognosis and it is not clear why [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Biomarkers of disease severity are otherwise lacking, or in their infancy of development, though autotaxins and the microbiome are being studied as well as other potential markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Additionally, the efficacy of investigational agents was limited by lack of clearly defined treatment end points. Furthermore, the development of fibrosis and the associated comorbidities of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis-related portal hypertensive complications of portosystemic encephalopathy, development and progression of esophageal varices, and variceal bleeding, ascites formation, and hepatocellular carcinoma risk take years if not decades to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Studies require years of careful data collection and large numbers of patients, which is lacking given the rarity of PBC, to determine treatment efficacies. Consensus guidelines have been developed to help reduce the heterogeneity of therapeutic trial outcomes and to allow for standardized assessment of treatment efficacy.</p><p id="Par10">In 2010, the AASLD published guidelines to set a standard for PBC trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It was realized that traditionally developed hard end points such as death or delay in the progression to liver transplant may not be the most reasonable way to evaluate drug efficacy in this condition which lacks many treatment options and takes years to decades to develop complications or lead to death or transplant. Biochemical parameters such as ALP and bilirubin, while not providing 100% correlation with histologic progression, have been considered to be reasonable indicators of clinical disease progression in PBC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Given this recognition that biochemical end points do have the ability to predict long-term outcomes at least in the setting of UDCA response, there is the ability to design comparative clinical trials using surrogate biomarkers such as ALP and bilirubin. To date, there are several such criteria including: the Barcelona, Mayo I and Mayo II, Paris I and II, Rotterdam and Toronto criteria for response to UDCA (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Each has variations in the acceptable biochemical response, with all but the Rotterdam using a reduction or normalization in ALP as an essential criterion. Additionally, the development of functional scores that predict outcomes such as the GLOBE score and UK-PBC score are now also available. There are several PBC histologic scoring systems. However, given the patchy nature of the disease and the invasiveness of liver biopsy, histology is felt to be an unfavorable means to assess treatment response for any emerging therapy.<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid response scoring criteria (alphabetical arrangement)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Scoring system</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Time (months)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Alkaline phosphatase</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Other biochemical markers</th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total bilirubin</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Transaminases</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Albumin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Barcelona</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Decrease 40% or normalization</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Globe</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">2 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Paris I</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">3 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1&#160;mg/dL</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">AST 2 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Paris II</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">1.5 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1&#160;mg/dL</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">AST 1.5 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rochester I</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">6</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">2 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rochester II</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">2 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1&#160;mg/dL</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rotterdam</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Normalization</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Normalization</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Toronto</td><td char="." align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">24</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">1.67 ULN</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The various proposed criteria for scoring a response to UDCA-treated patients are above presented.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is the mainstay of treatment and typically considered the foundation of any PBC treatment. Failure of UDCA therapy leads to add-on therapy such as the addition of OCA which is also approved for use as monotherapy in UDCA-intolerant patients. The last currently available treatment is liver transplantation which is reserved for patients who have developed end-stage liver disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)</title><p id="Par14">UDCA is a synthetic bile acid which exerts its beneficial effects through ill-defined mechanisms. It is believed to have impact on the immune system with anti-inflammatory properties, promote bile excretion, and reduce the severity of cell injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There are many formulations and dosages of UDCA available on the market without clear benefit of one over another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Given the possibility of gastrointestinal side effects, expert opinion recommends slow up-titration and preferably divided dosing of UDCA, though once daily dosing could be considered if compliance may otherwise be an issue. The therapeutic dose of UDCA is narrow and evidence suggests that 13&#8211;15&#160;mg/kg/day in divided doses is beneficial. Lower doses of UDCA 5&#8211;7&#160;mg/kg per day were found to be inferior to the 13&#8211;15&#160;mg/kg/day dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Higher doses of UDCA 23&#8211;25&#160;mg/kg/day have not been shown to offer any clinical benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. While UDCA is generally thought of as a benign medication, still higher doses of UDCA 28&#8211;30&#160;mg/kg/day have been shown to be harmful in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with an increase in hepatic decompensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

FXR agonism downregulates cytochrome 7A1, which is a major regulator of bile acid homeostasis. OCA, as previously discussed, is the best known FXR agonist. FXR functions in the hepatocyte to decrease bile acid synthesis, increase secretion and conjugation. In the stellate, or scar forming cells, FXR has been shown to decrease fibrosis. TGR5 is a membrane receptor for bile acids located on macrophages. In the Kupffer cell, agonism of the TGR5 receptor results in reduced cytokine production. In cholangiocytes, there is increased cell proliferation. The receptor is not however present in the hepatocyte. Sphinogsine1PR2 is also expressed in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and cholangiocytes. In hepatoctyes, activation results in decreased bile acid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. In cholangiocytes, there is an increase in cell production. Again, seen in Kupffer cells, there is a reduction in cytokine production.

However, within the last 3&#8211;5&#160;years research appears to be advancing. The mainstay of treatment is UDCA dosed at 13&#8211;15&#160;mg/kg/day preferably in divided doses (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For those patients failing to achieve adequate biochemical response based on any one of several available criteria which include reductions in ALP and normalization of bilirubin in most cases, other agents should be added. In patients intolerant to or failing to adequately respond to UDCA, OCA should be considered. The initial starting dose is 5&#160;mg/day and assessment should be made after 6&#160;months to determine whether a dose increase is necessary. A very important caveat is that OCA needs to be markedly dose reduced in the setting of cirrhosis due to concerns over safety. Instead of daily dosing, the dose should be 5&#160;mg once weekly, with careful up-titration to no more than 10&#160;mg twice weekly. Pruritus remains a common side effect. Outside an overlap condition, it is not currently clear that immunosuppressive agents have a defined role in pure PBC and are not currently recommended.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Proposed treatment algorithm for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dosed at 13&#8211;15&#160;mg/kg/day in divided doses is the standard treatment for all patients with PBC and should be initiated in all patients regardless of disease stage. In patients with incomplete response to UDCA therapy after one year, obeticholic acid (OCA) may be initiated at a dose of 5&#160;mg/day and up-titrated to 10&#160;mg/day after 6&#160;months if there is incomplete response. It may also be used as monotherapy in UDCA-intolerant individuals. Extreme care should be taken when initiating this therapy in cirrhotic patients. The maximum dosage is limited to no more than 10&#160;mg twice weekly in cirrhosis. Bezafibrate is an acceptable adjunctive therapy in Europe. It is not available in the USA. Fenofibrate (*) may be considered in an off-label use. Fibrates should not be combined with statins or used in advanced liver disease. Renal function should be monitored. Immunosuppression (^) specifically budesonide may be considered in patients with overlap PBC and autoimmune hepatitis. Other agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate and calcineurin inhibitors have less robust evidence to support use. For patients intolerant or failing the above regimens, clinical trials may be considered</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="535_2020_1664_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par42">While not approved in the USA, fibrates appear to be a very promising option, with both fenofibrate 160&#160;mg/day and bezafibrate 400&#160;mg/day showing beneficial effects on surrogate end points and symptoms including pruritus. Emerging data suggest that combination therapy with triple therapy with UDCA, OCA and fibrates may be even more beneficial in improving surrogate end points (AASLD 2019 #LB06). However, it should be noted that current guidelines recommend against the combination use of OCA and fibrates in advanced cirrhosis given the real risk of precipitating further decompensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, patients on fibrates need careful assessment of renal function, and for rhabdomyolysis. These agents should not be combined with statins. Clinical trials remain an option for patients failing or with intolerance to the aforementioned therapies.</p><p id="Par43">Treatment of symptoms and metabolic complications in patients with PBC is also very important. Given the autoimmune nature of the condition, assessment should be made for other autoimmune conditions such as monitoring of thyroid function, and for sicca symptoms including dry mouth.</p><p id="Par44">Pruritus and fatigue are the most common and severe complications of PBC. So far, no specific pharmacotherapy has proven beneficial in treating fatigue in PBC. Likewise, liver transplant has not been shown to improve fatigue either. Currently, a stepwise approach is recommended for pruritus (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Anion-exchange resins are considered the first-line treatment. Caution in proper timing of the dosage is advised, given that in addition to binding bile acids, they may also bind medications limiting their absorption. A stepwise approach thereafter with rifampicin, opiate antagonists or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline may also be used. Antihistamines are one of the most commonly prescribed medications and may be beneficial to help patients sleep given that sedation is a side effect. The recently reported results of the FITCH trial, which have shown bezafibrate to cause a greater than 50% reduction in pruritus symptoms in about 50% of patients, may ultimately result in fibrates being added to this algorithm (AASLD 2019 #13).<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Pruritus management in PBC. Pruritus is one of the most debilitating impairments to quality of life for PBC patients. The backbone of treatment is bile acid sequestration. In patients failing to respond to therapy, other agents may be added to the regimen including antihistamines, which most likely exert positive effect through sedation, rifampicin, though care must be taken to watch for hyperbilirubinemia and hepatotoxicity, the opioid antagonist naltrexone, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline dosed 75&#8211;100&#160;mg/day, which has shown effect independent of its antidepressive properties, and fibrates which appear to affect disease course and treat pruritus. Phenobarbital has been used but caution is advised given potential risk for toxicity</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO3" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="535_2020_1664_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">The treatment landscape for PBC is changing as newer treatment targets are investigated. Currently, UDCA remains the mainstay of treatment with adjunctive therapies added when incomplete response is achieved. Despite three phases of PBC, immune, cholestasis-induced injury and fibrosis, the cholestasis-induced injury seems to be the most promising physiologic target given the lack of data to support immune-system modulation and lack of studies evaluating anti-fibrotic therapies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="ethics"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par46">There was no financial support provided for the creation of this manuscript.
