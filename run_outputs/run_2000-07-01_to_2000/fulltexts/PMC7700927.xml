Routine assessment of a gamma camera&#8217;s energy peaking, planar intrinsic and extrinsic uniformity, intrinsic and extrinsic spatial resolution, and spatial linearity have been recommended by accrediting bodies such as the American College of Radiology (ACR)<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">

</xref> For single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems, additional tests using volumetric phantoms with different inserts are recommended to assess tomographic spatial resolution, cold sphere contrast detectability, and uniformity.</p><p>Energy peaking and planar uniformity testing for gamma cameras is often performed using manufacturer&#8208;supplied software. For the remaining tests, there are a variety of phantoms and methodologies. For planar spatial resolution and linearity testing, many phantoms, such as slit, orthogonal hole, parallel line equal spacing, and bar, are commercially available. It has been previously noted that four&#8208;quadrant bar phantoms are commonly used clinically due to their convenience<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">

</xref>; they can be used in combination with a sheet or a point source to evaluate both intrinsic and extrinsic spatial resolution, as well as linearity. For evaluation of tomographic acquisitions (i.e., SPECT), the ACR&#8208;approved Jaszczak phantom is used at many sites and is required for ACR accreditation.<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> As such, both the four&#8208;quadrant bar phantom and the ACR phantom are important tools for a complete clinical nuclear medicine QC program.</p><p>In the clinic, QC phantom images are often evaluated visually, subjecting the tests to inter&#8208; and intraobserver variability and bias.<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> In some cases, knowledge of pass/fail thresholds and pressure to keep imaging units active for patient imaging may influence the evaluator to pass a test that may be borderline by visual assessment. Additionally, qualitative analysis of phantom images is insensitive to small degradations in image quality, and evaluation is limited to discrete the levels of assessment dictated by the physical design of the phantom. As a whole, visual analysis lacks precision and reproducibility, but has proven valuable for uniformity and artifact evaluations.<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">

Historically, the AAPM has described standardized methods for performing QC tests and methods to quantify their results. AAPM Report 9 of the Nuclear Medicine Task Group described methods and standard definitions for quantifying integral and differential uniformity, statistical uniformity index, dead time, sensitivity, relative sensitivity (per collimator), spatial linearity, and the full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of a line source.<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>While these methods are certainly viable and have demonstrated great improvements over a visual analysis, they are better suited for academic or research centers with ample resources, time, and the knowledge to implement these methods for QC. Most of these methods are not feasible for routine clinical evaluation and have not seen wide&#8208;spread clinical implementation. Many of the methods presented previously either do not supply software to perform the appropriate calculations, utilize software not commonly found in most clinics (ImageJ, MATLAB, etc) require significant user input during analysis, demand some level of programming knowledge, or greatly increase the time required to perform QC. As a result, most clinical physicists and technologists choose not to adopt these methods and instead resort to visual analysis due to its efficiency.</p><p>The goal with this work was to create an automated QC workflow that is as efficient as visual analysis, and has the added benefits of objectivity, consistency, and sensitivity provided by quantitative analysis. Here we propose a method that is packaged to be easy to implement clinically not only for physicist use but also for technologist use, so the robustness of automated analysis can be applied across the QC program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="acm213057-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="acm213057-sec-0007"><label>2.A</label><title>QC&#8208;Track</title><p>QC&#8208;Track&#174; (Atirix Medical Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is commercially available software for diagnostic imaging quality control that allows representative images of phantoms to be used to build standard phantom analysis templates.

QC&#8208;Track assigns images to the appropriate device and phantom template using information in the DICOM header and requires minimal user input through a web&#8208;based user interface to save and report quality control data.

These templates were designed to read DICOM header information to correctly assign images, use image processing techniques to detect the phantom within each image, automatically place ROIs, and perform the appropriate calculations. To limit computational complexity, phantom templates were built using ROIs with a fixed position relative to the center of the phantom, and thus require a consistent phantom orientation during acquisition. Worksheet templates were built to automatically populate QC data from phantom images. We focused our initial efforts on designing templates for the bar and ACR phantoms as most gamma camera and SPECT manufacturers provide on&#8208;board software to analyze flood uniformity and center of rotation test results. The phantom and worksheet templates for the ACR phantom were built such that the user can select which transaxial slice they would like to analyze for each section of the phantom.</p><sec id="acm213057-sec-0009"><title>Bar phantom</title><p>For the bar phantom, three phantom templates were designed: one for rectangular phantoms with bar sizes 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, and 2.0&#160;mm [&#8220;bar phantom 1&#8221; &#8211; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="acm213057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(a)], one for rectangular phantoms with bar sizes 4.0, 3.5, 3.2, and 2.5&#160;mm [&#8220;bar phantom 2&#8221; &#8211; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="acm213057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(b)], and the third for square phantoms with bar sizes 6.4, 4.8, 4.0, and 3.2&#160;mm [&#8220;bar phantom 3&#8221; &#8211; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="acm213057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(c)].

All three templates apply a morphological dilation, followed by an erosion and Gaussian blur to eliminate small objects in the image and reduce noise. A threshold algorithm is used to detect the phantom and find the position of the phantom center (P<sub>x</sub>, P<sub>y</sub>). For bar phantoms 1 and 2, circular ROIs with 132&#160;mm diameters are placed within each quadrant at locations (P<sub>x</sub>&#160;&#177;&#160;134&#160;mm, P<sub>y</sub>&#160;&#177;&#160;104&#160;mm).

The MTF curves generated from the SD&#8208;based calculation show continuity across a wide range of clinically relevant spatial frequencies and good separation of MTF values for varying bars, within the statistical differences found for a given bar size. This makes it relatively straightforward to set quantitative thresholds on the MTF values for each bar. For example, for the 512&#160;&#215;&#160;512 matrix size, the 3.5&#8208;mm&#8208;bar MTF should be within &#956;&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#963; limits (0.22&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03) in most cases. These thresholds can be set for each bar to monitor the MTF across multiple frequencies. Alternatively, a linear interpolation of MTF values across the bar widths can be used to estimate the bar width for an MTF that correlates to a smallest &#8220;visible bar width.&#8221; For instance, since the &#8220;visualized by some physicists&#8221; region for the bar phantom test was found to be somewhere between 0.11 and 0.18, a threshold around MTF&#160;=&#160;0.12 could be set, requiring the interpolated bar width at that MTF to be less than 3.0&#160;mm. These quantitative measures provide a more objective test of the system&#8217;s planar spatial resolution. Furthermore, they provide higher sensitivity to subtle changes in camera performance since they are not restricted to the resolution of the four bar frequencies found in the bar phantom and cannot be confounded by reader differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="acm213057-sec-0033"><label>4.B</label><title>ACR phantom</title><sec id="acm213057-sec-0034"><label>4.B.1</label><title>Slice selection</title><p>The spheres section results indicate that slice selection, along with phantom positioning with respect to the axis of rotation, can influence the quantitative results. However, it should be noted that the visually selected slices for analysis were in all cases near the CNR peak that corresponds to the center of the spheres. We expect that the user performing the test would select a visually appropriate slice to analyze, and the results would reflect what is resolvable within that slice.</p><p>For the rods section, slice selection is less straightforward. The calculated modulation shows significant variability based on which individual slice is analyzed. This is likely because each rod has slight fluctuations in its alignment with the reconstructed image matrix because of the coarse pixel sampling inherent to SPECT reconstruction. Averaging the results of the modulation across ten slices shows much more consistent results across multiple acquisitions and has the benefit of analyzing a larger section of the phantom containing the rods. While averaging across multiple slices represents an axial slice that has reduced noise compared to any individual slice, summing of 10&#8208;12 slices has been suggested by both the ACR<xref rid="acm213057-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">

We envision this test for uniformity to provide some quantitative metric that may be useful for assessing the correctness of attenuation correction but believe that a visual assessment is still necessary for evaluation of subtle artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="acm213057-sec-0038"><label>4.D</label><title>Routine use and clinical feedback</title><p>Our method has been user&#8208;friendly enough to have been adopted by technologists with minimal additional training. It has been proven to be robust and efficient in a routine clinical setting. Technologists that regularly use the automated analysis module report that they appreciate the module as it simplifies analysis and saves time.</p></sec><sec id="acm213057-sec-0039"><label>4.E</label><title>Future work</title><p>If ROI misalignment due to phantom rotation is found to be a significant usability issue, we plan to incorporate a coregistration algorithm that aligns the ROIs to each phantom acquisition. Additional functionality is desired to recommend the &#8220;best slice&#8221; for analysis of the spheres section and to analyze the interior rods of the ACR phantom rods section. We are currently developing templates to automate the analysis of uniformity floods using the NEMA algorithm and to calculate center of rotation misalignment. Additionally, we hope to design a template that allows the bar phantom orientation on the detector to be changed weekly, to better characterize the extrinsic resolution of the entire detector.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="acm213057-sec-0040"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Here we have presented a method for automated quantitative quality control for gamma cameras that maintains the efficiency of visual analysis while increasing the sensitivity and consistency of the test. SD&#8208;based MTF analysis of the four&#8208;quadrant bar phantom shows good statistical separation of the MTF values between bar widths, allowing quantitative thresholds to be set for each imaging unit. Likewise, CNR analysis of the ACR phantom spheres section and modulation analysis of the rods section provides good quantitative separation of the results between different sized objects, and correlates well with visual analysis, allowing for a more reliable evaluation of SPECT performance. While the methods described in this paper are like other methods proposed previously, our workflow is structured in a way that allows for easy clinical implementation and routine use for both technologists and physicists. Practically speaking, our methodology can be used to improve routine clinical nuclear medicine QC programs as quantitative metrics provide more consistent, sensitive measurements than visual analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="acm213057-sec-0043"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>Tutku E.
