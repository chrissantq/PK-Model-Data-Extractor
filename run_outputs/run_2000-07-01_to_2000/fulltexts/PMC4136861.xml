<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, a common zoonotic pathogen, causes gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction and to modify the immune response to inflammation for centuries. This study used six herbal plants and four TCM formulae to rate their efficacy in preventing <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium infection via mouse model. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of <italic toggle="yes">Coptidis rhizome</italic> (CR) against the reference strain tallied 12.5 mg/ml and against clinical isolate ST21 was 25 mg/ml. MBCs of other herbal extracts and formulae on <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium strains were above 50 mg/ml. In the mice model, CR and Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZT) could significantly decrease the bacterial load in organs and blood after being challenged, along with body weight loss due to the infection. CR and SJZT alleviated infection-induced interferon-gamma levels in the serum and tissues, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) levels in intestinal tissues. CR and SJZT serum metabolites could suppress <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium invasion and TNF-&#945; expression in RAW264.7 cells. The therapeutic activity of CR and SJZT may involve berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin, interfering with <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> when invading macrophages. CR and SJZT has shown potential in preventing <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium infection through the regulation of the immune response.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by grants from China Medical University (CMU101-S-16) and the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan 1 (99AS-5.3.1-ST-aH), ROC.

<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> causes salmonellosis in humans and severe infections in animals <xref rid="pone.0105362-Mead1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which constitutes major public health problems, creating a severe economic impact on many countries. Over 2,500 <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> serotypes were identified up to 2004 <xref rid="pone.0105362-Popoff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Among them, <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> is an important pathogen responsible for food-borne diseases. <italic toggle="yes">S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium is a key serotype for salmonellosis transmitted from animals to humans <xref rid="pone.0105362-Mead1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Gastroenteritis caused by a <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> infection is usually self-limited, where antimicrobial treatment is seldom required <xref rid="pone.0105362-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Still, bacteria passing through the intestines and entering the bloodstream do warrant antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-resistant strains have arisen; over 50% of the isolates proved resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, the primary treatments of choice for salmonellosis <xref rid="pone.0105362-Chiu2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105362-Saxena1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Use of antibiotics in animals might result in the deposition of residues in meat products, which elevates the risk of spawning more resistant strains <xref rid="pone.0105362-Chiu2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0105362-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; herbal substitutes for antibiotics hold potential for the prevention and/or control of this disease.</p><p>Antibiotic treatment of infectious disease raises controversy worldwide. Utilizing the various traits of herbal plants in order to replace antibiotics might offer an alternative. Herbs that manifest certain qualities inhibiting <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> growth: e.g., extracts of CR and <italic toggle="yes">Gardeniae fructus</italic>, can exhibit antibacterial activity against certain strains, and the aqueous extract of <italic toggle="yes">Schizandrae fructus</italic> can be used to suppress growth of <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Paratyphi and <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Gallinarum <xref rid="pone.0105362-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that a methanol extract of CR, <italic toggle="yes">Mume fructus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Scutellariae radix</italic> combination, offered an alternative way to treat <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Gallinarum infection in chickens <xref rid="pone.0105362-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The aqueous extract of <italic toggle="yes">Houttuyniae herba</italic> has been shown to inhibit <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium growth and its invasion of macrophages; it can also significantly increase the survival time of infected mice <xref rid="pone.0105362-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Many TCM formulas have been widely used for improving gastrointestinal dysfunction and modifying the immune response to inflammation, such as Ger Gen Chyn Lian Tang and Huoh Shiang Jeng Chih San, which have shown curative effects in treating infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0105362-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-He1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Shen Ling Bai Zhu San has been reported to be capable of eliminating discomfort when diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0105362-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In a prior study, SJZT has even been shown to increase phagocytosis of mouse peritoneal macrophages <xref rid="pone.0105362-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Yet there are not many studies that conduct animal infection models to verify the bioactivities of these herbal materials. Herbal compounds that are administered orally, go through different metabolic systems or are altered through biotransformation. The bioactivities of herbal compounds in <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> might be quite different when used in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. In this study, six herbal plants and four traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulae were used to evaluate their efficiency in preventing <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium infection, using a murine model. <italic toggle="yes">Coptidis rhizome</italic> (CR), <italic toggle="yes">Houttuyniae herba, Taraxaci herba, Glycyrrhizae radix, Puerariae radix</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Rhizoma dioscoreae</italic> are herbal plants with antibacterial potential, used in Taiwanese folk medicine; Shen Ling Bai Zhu San and Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZT) are TCM formulas used for adjusting immunity <xref rid="pone.0105362-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; Huoh Shiang Jeng Chih San and Ger Gen Chyn Lian Tang are remedies for gastrointestinal dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0105362-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105362-He1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This study offers an alternative way to diminish the risk of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> infection in humans and animals and the further development of multidrug-resistant strains by utilizing various characteristics of these herbal plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethic Statement</title><p>Male BALB/c mice weighing about 20&#8211;22 g, obtained from the National Laboratory for Animal Breeding and Research Center, were maintained in specific pathogen-free (SPF) condition and used at 8&#8211;10 weeks of age.

Along with the invasion ability, the expression of TNF-&#945; induced by infection was suppressed simultaneously by the treatment&#8212;also in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105362-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0105362-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0105362.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Effects of (A) berberine, (B) ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin on ST21 invasion in infected RAW264.7 cells.</title><p>Results are expressed as mean &#177; standard deviation from three independent experiments.

In the mouse model, CR and SJZT has efficiently decreased the bacterial shedding in feces and the bacterial load in the organs and blood, hinting at the bioactivity of herbal materials being converted in organisms, which is difficult to evaluate <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. We indicated that, while bactericidal activities of the indicator compounds of CR and SJZT (berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin) were ineffective, however, they still prevented <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> from invading macrophages and hence might play a role in suppressing bacteria spreading systemically via circulation <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Interaction between compounds during preparation <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> or metabolism <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> might complicate the efficiency of their bioactivities. SJZT is a well-known formula that can modify the immunity in humans <xref rid="pone.0105362-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this mouse model, only the TCM formula SJZT could suppress body weight loss caused by infection. The ingredients of SJZT might interact with each other <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, causing this adjustment in immunity and eliminating the effects of infection.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of the serum metabolites of CR and SJZT on preventing <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> invasion. Both of them significantly decreased the invasion and TNF-&#945; expression induced by infection. These data indicated that the active ingredients of CR and SJZT that prevents an infection were metabolized and present in the serum. Based on our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> results, berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin might be the candidates.</p><p>A <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> infection could trigger pro-inflammatory response in both infected and neighboring cells <xref rid="pone.0105362-Kaiser1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In our study, the bacterial load in the organs was decreased by CR and SJZT treatment; thus ST21-induced TNF-&#945; expression was decreased in the intestinal tissues. A <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. Typhimurium infection could also activate macrophages through IFN-&#947; in order to trigger production of nitric oxide as a host defense <xref rid="pone.0105362-Lahiri1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Since berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin prevent bacteria from invading macrophages, CR and SJZT can lower IFN-&#947; level in serum of infected mice. In summary, if CR and SJZT are in the diet, there will be a significantly decreased <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> load in the organs and blood while also decreasing both TNF-&#945; and IFN-&#947; levels in serum, as well as the TNF-&#945; levels in the intestinal tissue caused by infection.</p><p>Since <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> can penetrate the epithelial lining of the intestines, an IgA response would then develop <xref rid="pone.0105362-Jantsch1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. IgM appears early in the process of infection. CR could suppress both serum IgA and IgM levels in infected mice, but SJZT could only decrease IgM levels&#8212;a detailed mechanism that needs further investigation.</p><p>Both CR and SJZT did not show strong bactericidal activity, nor did berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin. The mechanism of preventation might involve modulating the immunity against the infection, which is in a more systemic aspect. Herbal extracts consist of a variety of compounds with diverse characteristics and hence offer an alternative way to prevent infection. It has been shown that berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin have immunomodulating effects. Berberine could reduce the inflammatory responses caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref rid="pone.0105362-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; ginsenoside has been shown to inhibit viral influenza induced inflammation <xref rid="pone.0105362-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; glycyrrhizin has also revealed its way of modulating the innate immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) <xref rid="pone.0105362-Honda1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, CR and SJZT has shown their potential as preventive agents.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0105362-Mead1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
