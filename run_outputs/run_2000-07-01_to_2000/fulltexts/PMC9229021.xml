Owing to restricted transport across the BBB, FDA-approved drugs for the CNS have been generally limited to lipid-soluble small molecules. Drugs that do not cross the BBB can be re-engineered for transport on endogenous BBB carrier-mediated transport and receptor-mediated transport systems, which were identified during the 1970s&#8211;1980s. By the 1990s, a multitude of brain drug delivery technologies emerged, including trans-cranial delivery, CSF delivery, BBB disruption, lipid carriers, prodrugs, stem cells, exosomes, nanoparticles, gene therapy, and biologics. The advantages and limitations of each of these brain drug delivery technologies are critically reviewed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>blood&#8211;brain barrier</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>receptor-mediated transport</kwd><kwd>carrier-mediated transport</kwd><kwd>genetic engineering</kwd><kwd>IgG fusion proteins</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>liposomes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Contents</title><array orientation="portrait"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

Introduction</title><p>The driving force in the evolution of brain drug delivery technology is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the limitation this barrier creates in the development of new drugs for the brain. More than 98% of small molecule drugs do not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, which shows the selective organ uptake in the mouse of histamine, a small molecule drug with a molecular weight (MW) of just 111 Daltons (Da).</p><p>Following intravenous (IV) administration, histamine penetrates all of the organs of the body except for the brain and spinal cord (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The fraction of large molecule biologics that do not cross the BBB is essentially 100%. Therefore, brain drug development, in the absence of brain drug delivery technology, is limited to the &lt;2% of small molecules that penetrate the BBB via lipid-mediated free diffusion [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In order to develop new drugs for brain disease from either water-soluble small molecule drugs, or from biologics (recombinant proteins or nucleic acid pharmaceuticals), a multitude of brain drug delivery technologies have emerged over the last 40 years. These technologies can be broadly classified as:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Invasive brain drug delivery</italic>: the BBB is circumvented by drug injection into either the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following intrathecal or trans-nasal administration, or by trans-cranial direct injection of drug into brain tissue by either intra-cerebral implants or convection-enhanced diffusion (CED).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">BBB disruption brain drug delivery</italic>: the brain capillary endothelial tight junctions that form the BBB are disrupted by either the intra-arterial infusion of noxious agents, or by the intravenous injection of micro-bubbles followed by sonication of brain.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Trans-vascular brain drug delivery</italic>: the non-disrupted brain capillary endothelial barrier is traversed following the re-engineering of the pharmaceutical so as to gain access to multiple carrier-mediated transporters (CMT) for small molecules, or receptor-mediated transporters (RMT) for biologics. This category also includes the development of co-drugs that inhibit active efflux transporters (AET) at the BBB, such as p-glycoprotein (P-gp), as well as the free diffusion of lipid-soluble small molecules.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Within each of these 3 spheres, different parallel approaches have emerged to the point where brain drug delivery science has now evolved into a complex maze of competing technologies. This maze is nearly impenetrable by the artisan who practices outside the field of brain drug delivery, or even within a competing brain delivery area. The complexity of modern brain drug delivery science is illustrated by the outline in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Prior to an analysis of each of the brain drug delivery technologies shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the different anatomic locations of the BBB, at the brain capillary endothelium, and the blood&#8211;CSF barrier, at the choroid plexus, are reviewed. The presence of a barrier between blood and brain was discovered in 1900, and the limitation this barrier plays on brain drug delivery can be dated to 1914.</p><sec id="sec1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>1.1. Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier and Blood&#8211;CSF Barrier</title><p>The BBB and the blood&#8211;CSF barrier are functionally and anatomically distinct barriers within the brain. The different anatomical locations of the BBB and the blood&#8211;CSF barrier are viewed in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. The BBB, at the brain microvascular endothelium, is shown in the left panel, and the blood&#8211;CSF barrier, at the choroid plexus, is shown in the right panel of <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. The BBB at the brain capillary is formed by endothelial high resistance tight junctions that eliminate any paracellular pathway of solute movement from blood-to-brain extracellular space (ECS) [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Minimal pinocytosis within brain capillary endothelium removes any non-specific transcellular pathway of solute transport from blood to brain [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The blood&#8211;CSF barrier is formed by the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which lines the floor of each of the 4 cerebral ventricles, including both lateral ventricles shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (right panel). The blood&#8211;CSF barrier is leaky relative to the BBB, as reflected by the electrical resistance across these two barriers. The electrical resistance across the choroid plexus epithelial barrier is only 26 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, the electrical resistance across pial vessels on the surface of the brain is 1600 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, pial vessels express tight junctional complexes less developed than those in parenchymal vessels, and pial vessels are more permeable than parenchymal capillaries [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The electrical resistance across the endothelium of capillaries within brain parenchyma is estimated to be 8000 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is 300-fold higher than the resistance across the blood&#8211;CSF barrier [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Owing to the relative leakiness of the blood&#8211;CSF barrier, serum proteins readily move from plasma to CSF, as reflected by the high CSF/plasma ratio of IgG, which is ~0.2% [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, the brain/plasma IgG ratio in for the parenchyma of brain is &lt;0.01% [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The brain capillary endothelium, which forms the permeability barrier between blood and brain parenchyma, is buttressed on the blood side by the endothelial glycocalyx, and on the brain side by the capillary basement membrane and the astrocyte endfeet that terminate on the basement membrane [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The thickness of the endothelium is 300 nm from the luminal to the abluminal endothelial membranes [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The thickness of the glycocalyx ranges from 100 nm, as measured by electron microscopy [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], to 400 nm, as measured by two-photon microscopy [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The glycocalyx covers about 40% of the surface area of the endothelial luminal membrane [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The capillary basement membrane covers the entire abluminal endothelial membrane and has a thickness ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The basement membrane invests both the abluminal surface of the endothelium and the pericyte, which sits on the abluminal surface of the endothelium. Astrocyte endfeet terminate on the capillary basement membrane [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Electron microscopy of cryo-fixed brain shows the astrocyte endfeet cover about 63% of the basement membrane surface [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As discussed below, electron microscopy of brain shows that horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a 40 kDa protein, after injection into the brain, moves freely through the brain extracellular space (ECS), through the astrocyte endfeet, and through the capillary basement membrane to reach the abluminal surface of the capillary endothelium [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>1.2. History of the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</title><p>The first known recognition of a restrictive permeability of the blood vessels in brain was reported by Ridley in 1695, as reviewed by Liddelow [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Thakur et al. [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The restricted uptake of acidic vital dyes by brain as compared to peripheral organs was demonstrated by Ehrlich in the 19th century [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Acidic vital dyes were systemically injected in rabbits and all the organs were stained by the dye with the exception of the central nervous system (CNS). However, these observations were attributed to lack of adsorption of the dyes to brain tissue, and not to any barrier between blood and brain. In 1900, Lewandowsky reported experiments on the intravenous and intrathecal injection of sodium ferrocyanide, as reviewed by Liddelow [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Macinowski [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Lewandowsky observed ferrocyanide effects on the CNS following intrathecal injection but not after intravenous administration, and first used the term, <italic toggle="yes">blut-thirn-schranke</italic>, or blood&#8211;brain barrier, to characterize the selective permeability properties of the cerebral capillaries. In 1913, Goldman repeated Ehrlich&#8217;s observations that the brain was not stained by acidic dyes following intravenous injection in rabbits, but observed the brain was stained by the dye following intrathecal administration, and Goldman&#8217;s findings were summarized in the English literature by Mott in 1913 [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At this time, the prevailing view was that nutrients in blood passed first into the CSF and then into brain. Within this view, any barrier between blood and brain must necessarily lie at the choroid plexus, as reflected by Mott&#8217;s commentary on Goldman&#8217;s experiments:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#8220;Vital stains possess an affinity for the nervous system, and specially for the ganglion cells. If they are introduced by means of subcutaneous or intravenous injections, they are kept back by the plexus.&#8221;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8220;From the plexus choroideus the cerebro-spinal fluid receives important metabolic products, which are carried to the nerve substance by the fluid.&#8221;</p></list-item></list></p><p>However, in 1916, McIntosh and Fildes [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported their findings on the intravenous injection of basic vital dyes, methylene blue and neutral red, which do cross the BBB. They observed the brain stained with no parallel staining of the CSF, and made the following conclusions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#8220;Certain dye substances can pass directly from the blood to the brain substance proper without being found in the cerebrospinal fluid, while others fail to penetrate into the brain.&#8221;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Certain substances &#8220;do not possess the necessary solubility to allow them to pass from the blood-vessels into the brain substance. Their relative inefficiency has nothing to do with their absence from the cerebrospinal fluid&#8221;.</p></list-item></list></p><p>By 1916, McIntosh and Fildes [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] clearly localized the BBB to the brain capillary, not the choroid plexus, and recognized that CSF was not an intermediate compartment between blood and brain.</p><p>The ambiguity in regard to location of the BBB, i.e., brain capillary vs. choroid plexus, was reinforced by Stern working in the 1920s, who used the term, <italic toggle="yes">barrier-hemato-encephalique</italic>, or BBB, but concluded the BBB was localized to the choroid plexus [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, by the 1940s, workers such as Broman in 1941 [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Friedemann in 1942 [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] observed that the location of the BBB was clearly at the brain capillary wall, and not the choroid plexus. Friedemann [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] wrote, &#8220;this paper deals exclusively with the distribution of substances between blood and CNS. As will be shown, distribution between blood and CSF is an entirely different problem and remains outside the scope of this review.&#8221; In 1946, Krough [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] observed that Broman had shown the BBB was localized to the brain capillary endothelium.</p><p>Consensus on the location of the BBB was elusive, as Hassin [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] wrote in 1948 that &#8220;the cerebrospinal fluid represents the tissue fluids of the brain&#8221;, and that the &#8220;hemato-encephalique barrier (if one must consider such) is the Virchow-Robin spaces&#8221;. Hassin, in 1948, reinforced the 1913 view of Mott [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that CSF was an intermediate compartment as nutrients passed from blood to brain. The reluctance to even accept a specific location of the BBB was presented by Dobbing in 1961 [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], who disputed the concept of a specific BBB, and proposed the use of the term, &#8220;brain barrier system&#8221;. This concept of &#8216;brain barrier systems&#8217; is still used today [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], so as to lump together the BBB and blood&#8211;CSF barrier as a single system.</p><p>The anatomical location of the BBB was unambiguously localized to the brain capillary endothelium by the 1969 work of Brightman and Reese [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The brain was examined with electron microscopic histochemistry following the intravenous or intrathecal administration of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a protein of 40 kDa, or lanthanum, an electron dense trivalent cation [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Following intravenous injection, the transport of lanthanum from blood to brain was blocked by the endothelial tight junctions on the luminal side of the brain capillary endothelium, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> (left panel).</p><p>The endothelial tight junctions eliminated any para-cellular pathway for solute-free diffusion across the endothelium. In addition, no lanthanum was observed within intracellular vesicles, indicating the pinocytotic transcellular pathway found in endothelia of peripheral tissues is nearly eliminated within the brain capillary endothelium [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following the intrathecal administration of HRP, the 40 kDa protein was observed to move freely through the brain ECS, and to traverse the microvascular astrocyte endfeet and capillary basement membrane (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, right panel). However, further passage of HRP was blocked by the endothelial tight junction at the abluminal side of the capillary (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, right panel). After decades of controversy, this seminal work finally clarified unequivocally the location of the BBB as residing in the capillary endothelial cells, as suggested by several authors decades before. The anatomic basis of the endothelial barrier was the presence of high resistance tight junctions between endothelial cells. A total of 98% of all listings in PubMed under the search term, &#8216;blood&#8211;brain barrier,&#8217; has been generated since the 1969 publication of Brightman and Reese [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>1.3. History of Brain Drug Delivery</title><p>The first indication that the BBB would be a problem in brain drug development occurred in 1914, at the beginning of the synthetic pharmaceutical era. In 1913, Ehrlich described the production of salvarsan and neosalvarsan, which were the first commercial anti-microbial agents, and were marketed by Hoechst for the treatment of syphilis [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Salvarsan was a mixture of dimer and trimer complexes of neosalvarsan, which was a polar organic arsenical compound [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The first organo-arsenical compound, atoxyl, was synthesized in 1859, and used to treat trypanosomiasis [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Ehrlich determined the structure of atoxyl, and he and his colleague, Hata, synthesized salvarsan, and the more soluble, less toxic neosalvarsan, for the treatment of syphilis [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the syphilitic spirochete invades the brain to cause neurosyphilis, as described by Wile in 1916 [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Within a year of Ehrlich&#8217;s publication, McIntosh and Fildes [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in 1914, showed that salvarsan and neosalvarsan do not enter brain from blood in the rabbit following IV administration. They made the following observations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#8220;After intravenous injections of salvarsan and neosalvarsan in man and animals no arsenic can be found in the brain.&#8221;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8220;This phenomenon is not due to a lack of affinity between the brain and the drugs, but to an inability on the part of the drugs to penetrate into the substance of the brain.&#8221;</p></list-item></list></p><p>Therefore, in 1914, the problem of the blood&#8211;brain barrier and brain drug delivery was born. The most serious effect of syphilis, neurosyphilis, could not be treated by neosalvarsan, owing to the lack of transport of this drug across the BBB.</p><p>By the 1950s, drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants and chlorpromazine were developed for affective disorders of the brain [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These drugs crossed the BBB by free diffusion owing to high lipid solubility and low MW, in the range of 280&#8211;320 Da, as discussed in <xref rid="sec6dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1</xref>. The role of lipid solubility in BBB transport of small molecules was demonstrated by Oldendorf, in 1972, with the description of the comparative brain uptake of heroin, codeine, and morphine [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While lipid-soluble, low-MW drugs crossed the BBB and could be developed for certain brain disorders; drugs that lacked these characteristics were not effective, owing to lack of penetration of the BBB. This was exemplified by methotrexate, which was developed as a treatment for leukemic infiltration of the meninges. Methotrexate was not effective in the CNS following IV administration, so the drug was delivered directly into the CSF compartment by lumbar CSF injection [<xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The first brain drug delivery technology was developed by Ommaya in 1963 [<xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which was an implantable reservoir for catheter infusion of drug into the CSF of a lateral ventricle. Ommaya developed the reservoir to facilitate chronic treatment of bacterial meningitis with intrathecal antibiotic [<xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the Ommaya reservoir was not widely adopted, owing to the technical issues related to device implantation and maintenance. The next brain drug delivery system that was developed, albeit inadvertently, was the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) with L-DOPA, as reviewed by Hornykiewicz in 1966 [<xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It was known that PD was associated with striatal dopamine deficiency, and that treatment of PD with dopamine, per se, was not effective. However, the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, which is a large neutral amino acid, was effective in the treatment of PD. L-DOPA acted as a prodrug, as it was converted into dopamine in brain following the enzymatic action of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). The use of L-DOPA was an &#8216;accidental&#8217; brain drug delivery approach, as the efficacy of L-DOPA was not immediately linked to a BBB transport mechanism [<xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Nearly 10 years later, in 1975, Wade and Katzman [<xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], using the Brain Uptake Index (BUI) technique of Oldendorf [<xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], demonstrated that brain uptake of L-DOPA was mediated by a BBB neutral amino acid transport system. BBB transport of L-DOPA was saturable, and was inhibited by other large neutral amino acids [<xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The next brain drug delivery technology was introduced in 1979, which aimed to deliver drugs to brain following BBB disruption. The intra-carotid arterial infusion of hyperosmolar 25% (1.4 M) mannitol enhanced brain uptake of methotrexate in dogs [<xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Trans-nasal drug delivery to CSF was introduced as a means to bypass the BBB in 1982. Progesterone was administered to monkeys by intra-nasal or IV administration, and CSF levels of the steroid were reported to be higher following intra-nasal administration [<xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Over the 20-year period of 1980&#8211;2000, multiple brain drug delivery approaches were developed. Trans-cranial approaches were developed by 1994, and used intra-cerebral implants, including polymers [<xref rid="B51-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] or genetically engineered fibroblasts [<xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], or convection-enhanced diffusion [<xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Cationic vectors were developed including cationized albumin [<xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPP), such as tat [<xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] or penetratin [<xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Lipid carriers, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were developed [<xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Receptor-mediated transcytosis of receptor ligands through the BBB was proposed in 1986 [<xref rid="B58-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], followed by the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting either the BBB transferrin receptor [<xref rid="B59-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or insulin receptor [<xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The model active efflux transporter (AET) is p-glycoprotein (Pgp), and the high expression of Pgp at the brain capillary was demonstrated in 1989 [<xref rid="B62-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Nanotechnology for the brain was introduced with liposomes in 1990 [<xref rid="B63-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], nanoparticles in 1995 [<xref rid="B64-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and dendrimers in 2004 [<xref rid="B65-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. BBB disruption with the IV administration of microbubbles coupled with focused ultrasound (FUS) was developed in 2001 [<xref rid="B66-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and exosomes were introduced for brain drug delivery in 2011 [<xref rid="B67-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>A literature search in PubMed, using the keyword, &#8216;brain drug delivery&#8217; yielded a total of 19,087 citations, and over 80% of these citations cover the 20 areas in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The PubMed search was refined with the search term, &#8216;brain drug delivery and keyword&#8217;, where 20 different keywords were used, as listed in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Invasive Drug Delivery to Brain</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>2.1. CSF Delivery</title><sec id="sec2dot1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>2.1.1. CSF Macrocirculation and Microcirculation</title><p>There is 140 mL of CSF in the human CNS, and this fluid is produced at the choroid plexus that lines the four cerebral ventricles (four lateral ventricles, third ventricle, fourth ventricle) [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The CSF is absorbed into the peripheral blood, primarily across the arachnoid villi into the superior sagittal sinus of the venous system [<xref rid="B68-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This &#8216;macrocirculation&#8217; of the CSF is relatively rapid and turns over every ~5 h or ~5 times each day in the human brain [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The CSF production rate in the 2 g rat brain is 3.4 uL/min [<xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and in the 1400 g human brain, it is 350 uL/min [<xref rid="B70-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. There is also a &#8216;microcirculation&#8217; within the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain, as originally described by Cserr et al. [<xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Following the intra-cerebral injection of either 900 Da polyethylene glycol (PEG) or the 68 kDa albumin, both molecules exited the brain at a flow rate of 0.2 uL/min in the rat [<xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Since the rate of clearance was independent of MW, the mechanism of exodus was convection via peri-vascular pathways [<xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Ultimately, the tracers were transferred to blood via intermediate compartments composed of either CSF or the lymphatics. Qualitatively, the ISF microcirculation could provide a conduit for drug entry into brain parenchyma from the CSF. However, quantitatively, the ISF microcirculation is slow compared to the CSF macrocirculation. The rate of fluid flow in brain via the CSF macrocirculation, 3.4 uL/min in the rat [<xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], is nearly 20-fold higher than the rate of fluid flow via the ISF microcirculation, 0.2 uL/min, in the rat [<xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The comparative kinetics of the CSF microcirculation and the ISF microcirculation comport with the results of many studies that show solutes move from CSF to brain parenchyma slowly by diffusion, and not via more rapid convection pathways, as discussed below.</p><p>Transfer of solute between CSF and brain parenchyma via fluid convection is also called the glymphatic pathway. Early work in support of the convection pathway was reported by Wagner et al. in 1974 [<xref rid="B72-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and Rennels et al. in 1985 [<xref rid="B73-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and these investigations suggested the ISF microcirculation may proceed at high rates such that this pathway could provide for rapid transfer of solutes in CSF to the deep parenchyma of brain. In these studies, HRP was injected into the lateral ventricle of a rat [<xref rid="B72-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] or cat [<xref rid="B73-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and brain was removed just 10 min after the intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Histochemistry showed broad distribution of the HRP deep into brain parenchyma. However, these findings appear to be artifacts following the ICV injection of very large volumes of the HRP solution. In the rat study [<xref rid="B72-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], a volume of 35 &#956;L of 7% HRP was injected into one lateral ventricle as a bolus. This volume is 300% greater than the volume of the lateral ventricle in the rat, which is 12 &#956;L [<xref rid="B74-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In the cat study [<xref rid="B73-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], a volume of 1000 &#956;L of 4% HRP was injected. This volume is 800% greater than the volume of the lateral ventricle in the cat, which is 130 &#956;L [<xref rid="B75-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In both studies, it was necessary to cannulate either the contralateral ventricle [<xref rid="B72-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], or the cisterna magna [<xref rid="B73-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], to reduce the high pressure introduced by these high-volume injections. As discussed below, multiple studies on the passage of drugs from CSF to brain parenchyma do not support a quantitatively significant role of the convection pathway under conditions of normal pressure in the CSF compartment.</p><p>In support of the convection pathway for drug delivery from CSF to brain parenchyma, extensive distribution of a therapeutic MAb into brain parenchyma of the primate was observed following ICV administration of the antibody [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this study actually supports the classical diffusion pathway. The MAb against the beta secretase-1 was continuously infused 24/7 for 42 consecutive days into the left lateral ventricle of a primate at a rate of 0.4 mL/day. At the end of the 42-day continuous infusion, the brain was removed and the MAb concentration was measured in multiple regions of brain by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed the MAb was distributed to both sides of the brain, but MAb entry into brain parenchyma was confined to gray matter, with no MAb visible in white matter [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lack of MAb penetration into white matter is inconsistent with a convection pathway, as perivascular flow occurs preferentially in white matter [<xref rid="B76-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The MAb concentration in the contralateral motor cortex, which is near the CSF surface, is nearly 30-fold greater than the MAb concentration in the contralateral putamen, a deep parenchyma structure. If convection into brain was the prominent pathway, then the concentration in motor cortex and putamen should be comparable. Quantitative considerations indicate that diffusion, not convection, is the principal mechanism of MAb distribution from CSF to brain parenchyma following ICV infusion for 42 consecutive days. Given a MAb diffusion coefficient in brain of 0.6 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s [<xref rid="B77-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and a time for diffusion of 42 days (3.6 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> s), the diffusion diameter is 30 mm. The width of the primate brain is 40 mm [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, diffusion alone would be expected to cover 75% of the primate brain following a 42-day constant ICV infusion.</p><p>Support for the classical diffusion pathway of solute movement from CSF to brain comes from a variety of studies. In 1969, Brightman and Reese [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] injected HRP into the lateral ventricle of the mouse brain, and removed the brain at either 10 min or 90 min for histochemistry. The use of different fixation protocols showed the movement of HRP into brain tissue occurred in vivo, and was not a post-mortem artifact. The distribution of HRP at 10 min and 90 min is shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A.</p><p>The HRP diffused 0.2 mm and 0.7 mm into peri-aqueductal brain at 10 min and 90 min, respectively (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Given a brain diffusion coefficient for HRP of 0.6 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s, it is expected that HRP would diffuse 0.2 mm and 0.7 mm in 10 min and 90 min, respectively [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of HRP into brain shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A can be accounted for solely on the basis of diffusion. In 1970, Levin and colleagues showed the concentration of inulin was decreased 10-fold at just 1&#8211;2 mm from the CSF surface in rabbits, cats, dogs, and monkeys [<xref rid="B80-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In 1975, Blasberg et al. [<xref rid="B78-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] injected small molecules (thiotepa, hydroxyurea, methotrexate) into the lateral ventricle of the Rhesus monkey, and removed the brain 60 min after ICV injection. Drug concentration was measured at 1 mm intervals removed from the CSF surface. Drug concentration in brain decreases logarithmically, and is just 1% of the CSF concentration at 1&#8211;2 mm removed from the ependymal surface (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). The logarithmic decline in brain drug concentration is consistent with a diffusion model, not a convection model, of drug distribution from CSF to brain. Moreover, diffusion is inefficient as a drug delivery mechanism, and the drug concentration in brain is decreased 99% at just 1&#8211;2 mm from the ependymal surface (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). In 1994, Yan et al. [<xref rid="B79-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] injected [<sup>125</sup>I]-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the lateral ventricle of the rat. The brain was removed 24 h later, and coronal sections were analyzed with film autoradiography. The study shows that BDNF distributes only to the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricle ipsilateral to the injection and to the third ventricle. BDNF diffusion into brain parenchyma from the CSF compartment is limited to a distance of only 0.2 mm. The failure to observe BDNF in the contralateral brain is due to the unidirectional flow of CSF from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle and into the spinal canal and over the convexities of the cerebrum. The only path for distribution to the contralateral ventricle following a ICV injection in one lateral ventricle is reflux through the foramen of Monro from the third ventricle to the contralateral lateral ventricle. There may be minimal reflux during diastole [<xref rid="B81-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], but this does not result in significant drug distribution to the contralateral ventricle as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C. The distribution in brain of [<sup>125</sup>I]-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 following an ICV injection of the peptide was also determined by film autoradiography, and a result identical to that shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C was reported [<xref rid="B82-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In summary, the data in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> show that drug movement from CSF to brain parenchyma is limited by diffusion, which is fundamentally incompatible with a quantitatively significant role for the convection or glymphatic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>2.1.2. Drug Transfer from CSF to Blood</title><p>The paradox of intrathecal drug delivery to brain, i.e., drug injection into the CSF compartment, is that this route delivers drug to blood, not to brain parenchyma. The studies described in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> show that the ICV route only delivers drug to the ependymal surface of brain lining the CSF flow tracts. In parallel with the slow entry of drug into brain, there is a rapid movement of drug from CSF to blood following ICV drug administration. This fast CSF-to-blood transfer occurs as the entire CSF volume is absorbed into the venous blood ~5 times per day. In 1965, Fishman and Christy [<xref rid="B83-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] studied the distribution of corticosteroids in blood following an intrathecal injection, and they concluded, &#8220;the intraspinal route of administration of free steroid is, in effect, equivalent to no more than a prolonged intravenous injection&#8221;. Additionally, in the 1960s, Reed and Woodbury [<xref rid="B84-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] showed the plasma profile of iodide in rats was identical within 5 min of administration either as an IV injection or as an intrathecal injection in the cisterna magna. In 1984, Aird [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] showed that the dose of barbiturate that induced anesthesia in dogs was identical whether the drug was administered by injection into the blood or the CSF of the cisterna magna. After CSF injection, the drug rapidly moved to the blood, and then entered brain following transport across the BBB. Aird [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] concluded, &#8220;the relative effectiveness of intrathecal agents should be evaluated by comparing maintenance doses for a given central effect, when produced by both intrathecal and IV route&#8221;. That is, a clinical trial testing the CNS efficacy of a drug following intrathecal injection should include a control group wherein the drug was administered by IV injection. This point is illustrated for an Ommaya reservoir clinical trial discussed in <xref rid="sec2dot1dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1.4</xref>.

Lumbar CSF Drug Delivery</title><p>Some drugs are FDA approved for CNS conditions following drug injection into the lumbar CSF. As noted by Aird [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], intrathecal drug delivery can be effective for conditions that affect the <italic toggle="yes">surface</italic> of the brain or spinal cord, which is contiguous with the CSF flow tract. Intrathecal morphine is effective for pain [<xref rid="B91-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], because opioid receptors are expressed on the surface of the spinal cord [<xref rid="B92-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].

Nusinersen is a 2&#8242;-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO), which modulates alternative splicing of the survival motor neuron (SMN)-2 gene [<xref rid="B96-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. SMA is a disease of spinal cord motor neurons, and these neurons lie near the surface of the spinal cord [<xref rid="B97-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Nusinersen is not representative of drug distribution in the spinal cord following intrathecal administration. Nusinersen has a very long residence time in CSF with a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 191 days in the mouse [<xref rid="B96-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The molecular basis for this long residence time in CSF is not clear but appears to be related to the sulfur moiety of the phosphorothioate ASO. A phosphorodiamidate ASO, which is a sulfur-free ASO, is less effective in vivo, although both the phosphorothioate ASO and the phosphorodiamidate ASO are equally effective in cell culture [<xref rid="B96-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Based on the FDA approval of intrathecal nusinersen for a disease of the surface of the spinal cord, other ASOs entered CNS clinical trials for treatment of the parenchyma of brain or spinal cord by drug injection into the lumbar CSF. Tominersen is an ASO targeting the huntingtin mRNA of Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD), and tofersen is an ASO targeting the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mRNA of SOD1 dependent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref rid="B98-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Since these ASOs do not cross the BBB, and since no antisense BBB delivery technology was developed by the drug sponsors, both tominersen and tofersen were delivered to brain by intrathecal injection into the lumbar CSF [<xref rid="B98-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The phase 3 trials of both tominersen and tofersen ended in clinical failures, which is attributed to the poor penetration of drug into brain parenchyma following drug injection into CSF. The nusinersen model for treatment of the surface of the spinal cord by lumbar CSF injection could not be replicated for treatment of the parenchyma of brain by lumbar CSF injection.</p><p>In an effort to treat the brain in genetic lysosomal storage disease, the recombinant lysosomal enzyme was delivered to brain by intrathecal injection into the lumbar CSF.

A reservoir is implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of the skull and a catheter connects the reservoir to the CSF compartment of one lateral ventricle. An Ommaya reservoir delivery approach can be expected to treat diseases of the surface of the brain, which are contiguous with the CSF flow tract, such as meningitis, or meningeal infiltration in acute leukemia, and the first application of the Ommaya reservoir was the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis [<xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In 1975, Shapiro et al.

Previously, in 1962, Rieselbach et al.

The injection of chemotherapeutic agents into the ventricular CSF with an Ommaya reservoir is still current practice, particularly for childhood brain tumors [<xref rid="B104-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].</p><p>The Ommaya reservoir was originally designed to treat acute diseases of the surface of the brain following injection of the antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agent into the ventricular CSF. However, given the legacy misconception that CSF is equivalent to the ECS of brain, as discussed in <xref rid="sec1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 1</xref>, it was natural to broaden the application of the Ommaya reservoir to the treatment of chronic disease of the brain parenchyma. Setting aside the invasive nature, and clinical complications of this delivery system [<xref rid="B105-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], the physiology of drug transfer from CSF to brain would argue against the viability of treating intra-parenchymal brain disease by chronic ICV drug administration. First, investigations over many decades show that drug in CSF distributes only to the CSF surface of the brain as illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, and discussed in <xref rid="sec2dot1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1.1</xref>. Second, drug injected into the CSF rapidly moves to the peripheral blood, where the drug can exert pharmacologic actions in peripheral organ, which could be falsely attributed to a CNS site of action, as discussed in <xref rid="sec2dot1dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1.2</xref>. As originally emphasized by Aird [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] in 1984, any examination of the pharmacologic effect of intrathecal drug administration should include a side-by-side evaluation of drug effects following IV infusion. Predictably, with one exception discussed below, ICV drug administration has not achieved FDA approval for the treatment of brain parenchyma of chronic disease. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and multi-focal leukoencephalopathy were treated with cytarabine, a highly polar small molecule, by weekly injections into the ventricular CSF with an Ommaya reservoir, but without a clinical benefit [<xref rid="B106-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was administered to PD patients by the ICV route, but without a clinical effect on the disease [<xref rid="B107-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. A potential toxicity may arise from the ICV administration of neurotrophic factors. This mode of brain drug delivery produces a very high drug concentration at the ependymal surface of brain, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C. The repeat ICV injection of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) causes a reactive astrogliosis along the ependymal surface [<xref rid="B108-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The chronic ICV infusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates axonal sprouting and Schwann cell hyperplasia within the pial-arachnoid surface of brain [<xref rid="B109-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>].</p><p>In 2017, the FDA approved the first, and only, treatment of parenchymal brain disease where the drug is administered with a chronically implanted Ommaya reservoir in a lateral ventricle. Recombinant tripeptidyl tripeptidase 1 (TPP1, cerliponase alfa) was approved for the treatment of Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 2 (CLN2) disease following ICV enzyme infusion in a lateral ventricle [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. CLN2 disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene, and is characterized by childhood neurodegeneration, language delay, motor abnormalities, seizures, blindness, and early death [<xref rid="B111-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The cDNA encoding for human TPP1 was cloned and expressed in CHO cells in 2001 [<xref rid="B112-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. However, intravenous Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with recombinant TPP1 was not initiated for CLN2 disease, because TPP1 does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B113-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. So as to develop a treatment of the brain in CLN2 disease, the TPP1 proenzyme was infused in children with CLN2 disease into a lateral ventricle with a chronically implanted Ommaya reservoir every 2 weeks at a dose of 300 mg of enzyme in a volume of 10 mL over a 4 h period [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. This infusion volume exceeds the entire volume of the lateral ventricle, which is 8.5 mL in adult humans, as discussed in <xref rid="sec10dot1dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 10.1.4</xref>. The control group in this pivotal clinical trial was not intravenous ERT, but rather historical controls [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The trial should have been designed with an intravenous ERT treatment group, because the TPP1 enzyme in CSF rapidly is exported to blood [<xref rid="B114-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. TPP1, similar to other lysosomal enzymes, is mannose 6-phosphorylated (M6P), and is a ligand for the M6P receptor (M6PR) [<xref rid="B112-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], which is widely expressed in peripheral tissues [<xref rid="B115-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Owing to the high expression of the M6PR in peripheral tissues, recombinant TPP1 is rapidly taken up by peripheral tissues, and is cleared from plasma with a T<sub>1/2</sub> of just 12 min [<xref rid="B113-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Lipofuscin granules, the lysosomal inclusion bodies that accumulate in CLN disease, are formed in peripheral organs including skeletal muscle [<xref rid="B116-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Therefore, following the ICV injection, the TPP1 enzyme moves from CSF to plasma followed by uptake into peripheral organs via the M6PR. This process could contribute to the improved motor function of children with CLN2 disease as compared to historical controls that expressed no TPP1 enzyme [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Such speculation would have been obviated by a clinical trial design that compared ICV drug delivery with intravenous drug delivery, as opposed to historical controls [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The admonitions of Fishman and Christy in 1965 [<xref rid="B83-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], and of Aird in 1984 [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], that an intrathecal drug injection is similar to an IV infusion, were not heeded in the trial design of TPP1 in CLN2 disease [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. To date, recombinant TPP1 for CLN2 is the only treatment that is FDA approved for any chronic CNS disease of brain parenchyma wherein the drug is infused in a chronically implanted Ommaya reservoir in a lateral ventricle [<xref rid="B117-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>2.2.

Intra-Cerebral Implants</title><p>An alternative to intrathecal drug delivery to brain is a trans-cranial intra-cerebral injection of drug encapsulated in a polymer or released from a genetically engineered cell line. However, similar to intrathecal drug delivery, the limiting factor in intra-cerebral delivery is diffusion. The brain concentration of drug that enters the parenchyma via diffusion decreases logarithmically with each mm of diffusion distance [<xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], as illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The maximal effective diffusion distance for small or large molecules in brain is 0.2&#8211;2 mm, and this is irrespective of the mechanism of delivery including intra-cerebral implants, ICV administration, intra-cerebral micro-dialysis or intra-cerebral micro-infusion [<xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>].</p><p>There is an FDA-approved treatment for brain cancer, carmustine or Gliadel<sup>&#174;&#174;</sup>, which is an intra-cerebral implant form of brain drug delivery. Carmustine is a dime-sized wafer of a water-soluble polymer embedded with a small molecule chemotherapeutic alkylating agent, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitroso urea (BCNU) [<xref rid="B51-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B119-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The polymer is 20% 1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) propane and 80% sebacic acid, which is a C-8 dicarboxylic acid found in castor oil. The carmustine polymeric/BCNU wafer is placed in the brain cavity created by the neurosurgical extirpation of the bulk of the cancer, and was first tested in recurrent malignant glioma [<xref rid="B120-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], followed by trials that placed the wafer in the brain cavity at the first surgical resection for malignant glioma [<xref rid="B121-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,<xref rid="B122-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].

Subsequent to the 1996 FDA approval of carmustine, no similar intra-cerebral implants for brain cancer, or any other brain disease, have reached regulatory approval. This intra-cerebral implant approach to brain drug delivery cannot escape the physical limitations of diffusion, and the fact that brain 2 mm or more away from the implant is exposed to very little drug released from the wafer [<xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>,<xref rid="B119-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>].</p><p>The intra-cerebral implant method of brain drug delivery has also been tested following the intra-cerebral injection of genetically modified cells. Rat fibroblasts permanently transfected with a lentivirus encoding for prepro brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were implanted in the substantia nigra of rats 1 week prior to the intra-striatal injection of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) [<xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. MPP+ injection creates an experimental model of PD, which involves neurodegeneration of the nigral-striatal tract in brain. The intra-cerebral implant of the BDNF secreting cells doubled the number of surviving neurons in the nigral-striatal tract [<xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The C2C12 mouse myoblast line was permanently transfected with a gene encoding for human GDNF and encapsulated in a 5 mm rod composed of poly(ethyl-sulfone), followed by implantation in the striatum of the rat, and the diffusion of GDNF from the rod was followed by immunohistochemistry [<xref rid="B124-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>].

Trans-Nasal Drug Delivery to Brain</title><p>The first report of drug movement from the nasal cavity to CSF was described 40 years ago [<xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Since then, over 1000 publications have evaluated drug delivery to brain and CSF via the nasal route (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, to date, there is not a single FDA-approved drug for treatment of the brain parenchyma that is administered by the intra-nasal route [<xref rid="B143-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. To understand why 40 years of research on nasal delivery in animals has not translated to humans, it is useful to consider species differences in the anatomy of the nasal-cribriform plate. Species differences in the nasal cavity anatomy are consistent with the much greater role of olfaction in animals as compared to humans, as reflected in the number of olfactory receptor (OR) genes. OR genes comprise the largest multi-gene family in the mammalian genome, and constitute 4&#8211;5% of the mammalian proteome [<xref rid="B144-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. There are about 2000 OR genes in the rat [<xref rid="B145-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], about 1000 OR genes in the mouse, but only about 400 OR genes in humans [<xref rid="B144-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. The olfactory region of the nasal mucosa, which is the site where drug must penetrate the nasal mucosa to enter olfactory CSF, constitutes 50% of the nasal cavity surface area in the rat, but only 3% of the nasal cavity surface area in humans [<xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Another factor limiting the translation of nasal drug delivery from animals to humans is the fact that the vast majority of preclinical investigations on nasal drug delivery to brain are performed with experimental designs that produce local nasal injury and membrane disruption, owing to the nasal instillation of very large volumes of drug. The introduction of &gt;100 &#956;L in the human nostril causes local injury to the nasal mucosa [<xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,<xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The volume of the nasal cavity in humans is 20 mL, but is only 0.4 mL in the rat, and only 0.03 mL in the mouse [<xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Therefore, by extrapolation, the nasal administration of a volume greater than 1% of the volume of the nasal cavity can induce local injury. A nasal administration volume of 1% of the nasal cavity volume would be 4 &#956;L in the rat and 0.3 &#956;L in the mouse. A review of the literature discussed below shows that the nasal administration volumes in preclinical nasal drug delivery research are 1&#8211;2 log orders higher than these injury related volume thresholds.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>3.1. Drainage of CSF from Brain to Nose</title><p>There is evidence from animal models that CSF drains from the subarachnoid space of brain into the nasal mucosa, and then to the lymphatic system.

A fraction of the radioactivity was recovered in the peripheral lymph, and this transfer to lymph was blocked by sealing the cribriform plate. Albumin, or at least the radioactivity, was demonstrated to pass from the CSF compartment of brain through the cribriform plate to the interstitial space of the olfactory submucosa or lamina propria [<xref rid="B152-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>].

The olfactory CSF within the subarachnoid space of the olfactory bulb moves in parallel with the invaginations of the olfactory arachnoid membrane and dura around the olfactory nerves, which pass from the olfactory bulb to the nasal mucosa through the fenestrations of the neural foramina of the cribriform plate. The arachnoid membrane peels away from the olfactory nerve at 1&#8211;2 mm into these foramina, where the dura becomes continuous with the periosteum of the cribriform plate [<xref rid="B149-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>].</p><p>In the late embryonic rat, there are &#8216;olfactory bulb holes&#8217;, or disruptions of the arachnoid membrane at the cribriform fenestrations, which allow for drainage of olfactory CSF into the nasal mucosa [<xref rid="B153-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>].

An MRI study [<xref rid="B150-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] in humans shows a gadolinium contrast agent that is injected into the CSF enters the proximal part of the cribriform fenestrations, but does not complete passage though these fenestrations, nor enter into the nasal submucosa (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). This recent study in living humans does not confirm the hypothesis generated in animal investigations that CSF passes from the olfactory CSF into the nasal mucosa. Such passage of CSF from the olfactory region to the nasal submucosa would be a form of chronic subclinical CSF rhinorrhea, a condition associated in humans with local trauma to the cribriform plate [<xref rid="B154-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>3.2. Drug Delivery from Nose to Brain</title><p>Drug transport from nose to olfactory CSF involves drug transfer across 2 epithelial barriers, both of which are membrane barriers with tight junctions, and these barriers are the nasal epithelium and the arachnoid membrane. Therefore, drug delivery from nose to olfactory CSF is governed by the same principles that determine BBB transport. As discussed below is <xref rid="sec6dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1</xref>, lipid-soluble small molecules with a MW &lt; 450 Da traverse these barriers by free diffusion. Any drug with a MW &gt; 450 Da can only traverse the barrier by either (a) carrier- or receptor-mediated transport, or (b) membrane disruption, e.g., by local injury to the nasal mucosa. Similar to the BBB, the transport of small molecules from the nasal cavity to CSF is proportional to lipid solubility [<xref rid="B155-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. In 1982, progesterone was administered trans-nasally in primates, and the area under the concentration curve (AUC) in CSF was about twice as high as the AUC in CSF following IV administration [<xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These results were interpreted as evidence for a pathway of drug delivery from nose to CSF. However, the diluent injected in the nose in this study was 30% ethanol/30% propylene glycol [<xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which may have had a solvent effect at the nasal mucosa. In a study in the rat, progesterone was administered via the nasal route in a saline diluent, and the AUC in CSF of progesterone was identical after IV or intra-nasal delivery [<xref rid="B156-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Similarly, melatonin [<xref rid="B157-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] and vitamin B12 [<xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] were administered via the intra-nasal and IV routes, and the AUC in CSF was identical for either form of delivery. If the drug passed directly from the nose to the olfactory CSF, then the AUC in the CSF should be higher after the nasal route as compared to the IV route. Conversely, the finding of a comparable AUC in CSF after either the IV or the nasal route indicates the drug passes across the nasal epithelium, enters blood, and then traverses the choroid plexus at the blood&#8211;CSF barrier, to enter the CSF compartment. A 1990 study on the potential delivery of a novel cognitive enhancer for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) via the trans-nasal route showed the brain AUC of the drug was the same following either IV or trans-nasal administration [<xref rid="B158-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. In 1991, the brain concentration of dextromethorphan was shown to be the same whether this drug was administered by the IV or the trans-nasal route [<xref rid="B159-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. In 2008, it was shown that the ratio of brain AUC/plasma AUC for diazepam was comparable following drug administration via either the IV or the trans-nasal routes [<xref rid="B160-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>].</p><p>Despite the early work showing the trans-nasal route conferred no selective delivery of drug to CSF, the number of investigations of the trans-nasal route grew exponentially, and 98% of the 1024 publications on trans-nasal brain drug delivery (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were published after 2000. Trans-nasal drug delivery to CSF succeeded once large volumes of drug were applied to the nasal cavity, particularly in rats and mice, where the olfactory region constitutes 50% of the nasal cavity surface area [<xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. These large volumes induced local injury and disruption of the nasal barriers, similarly to the attempts to enhance brain drug delivery via BBB disruption as reviewed in <xref rid="sec4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref>. The instillation of drug volumes greater than 100 &#956;L per naris in humans causes local injury [<xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] and the preferred volume for nasal administration in humans is as low as 25 &#956;L per naris [<xref rid="B161-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. These volumes are &lt;1% of the nasal cavity in humans. However, in studies in rats and mice the volume of drug introduced into the nose is typically 25&#8211;50 &#956;L, which is very large compared to the volume of the nasal cavity in the rat, 400 &#956;L, or the mouse, 30 &#956;L [<xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The introduction of large volumes into the naris can lead to drug loss into the oral cavity via drainage through the naso-palatine duct in rodents, although this duct is a vestigial organ in adult humans. Therefore, the naso-palatine duct was blocked prior to the nasal introduction of 50 &#956;L in the rat [<xref rid="B162-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. In this 1999 study, the intra-nasal administration of a volume of 50 &#956;L in the rat, which is 12% of the nasal cavity volume, produced a higher CSF concentration of 5-fluorouracil than the CSF drug concentration produced by IV administration [<xref rid="B162-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>].</p><p>The administration of 5 &#956;L in the naris of the mouse, which is a volume that is 15% of the nasal cavity in the mouse, resulted in the delivery of dopamine to the olfactory bulb of brain [<xref rid="B163-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. In a similar study, a 5 &#956;L volume of picolinic acid in the naris of the mouse resulted in drug delivery to the olfactory bulb [<xref rid="B164-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Drug delivery to brain of either dopamine or picolinic acid was measured by film autoradiography, which showed the olfactory bulb was the only region of brain penetrated by the drug following the instillation of large volumes into the mouse nose [<xref rid="B163-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,<xref rid="B164-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. In a recent study, insulin was injected into the naris of a mouse in a volume of 25 &#956;L [<xref rid="B165-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], which is nearly equal to the entire nasal cavity in the mouse. Conversely, no delivery of IGF-1 to brain was produced following the intra-nasal administration of the peptide in a large volume, 35 &#956;L, in the mouse [<xref rid="B166-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. In addition to the introduction of large volumes into the nasal cavity, other means of membrane destabilization have been employed to enhance drug delivery across the nasal barriers. Carbamazepine was administered by either the IV or trans-nasal routes in the rat; for nasal administration the drug was co-administered in an unspecified volume with 50 mg of a gel composed of the Carbopol 974P bioadhesive [<xref rid="B167-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Other nasal enhancers that have been employed include 0.5% peppermint oil [<xref rid="B168-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>] and 2% polysorbate-80 [<xref rid="B169-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>].</p><p>In keeping with the analogy of drug delivery across the nasal barrier and the BBB, a preferred approach is not membrane disruption, but rather modification of the drug so that the drug becomes a ligand for endocytosis. As discussed in <xref rid="sec7-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 7</xref>, cationic agents may undergo endocytosis into the brain capillary endothelium via absorptive-mediated endocytosis. Lectins, such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), can also undergo absorptive-mediated endocytosis into the brain endothelium [<xref rid="B170-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. A conjugate of WGA and HRP, but not unconjugated HRP, distributes to the olfactory lobe in rats following the intranasal administration of 25&#8211;50 &#956;L into each naris of a 1% solution [<xref rid="B171-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Cationization of a biologic also facilitates entry into CSF following intra-nasal administration. The lysosomal enzyme, iduronidase (IDUA), was cationized by conjugation of guanidinylated neomycin (Gneo) to the enzyme [<xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Guanidinylation of neomycin converts all 6 amino groups to positively charged guanidine moieties. Gneo is endocytosed by cells via absorptive-mediated endocytosis, similar to other polycations, such as poly-arginine [<xref rid="B173-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Gneo-IDUA was infused into the nose in a volume of 50 &#956;L in IDUA-null mice, and CSF enzyme activity was measured [<xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Gneo-IDUA entered the CSF, which peaked at 1 h and over 90% of the enzyme was cleared from CSF by 4 h after injection [<xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. IDUA was also detected in the olfactory bulb, and the enzyme activity in this region of brain was &gt;10-fold higher than any other region of brain [<xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>].</p><p>Drug distribution following trans-nasal administration has been investigated by PET. The glucose analog, [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), was administered in the rat in volumes of 5 &#956;L [<xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. FDG entered only the inferior part of the turbinates of the cribriform plate and did not reach the superior part of the turbinate, and did not enter into the olfactory bulb [<xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. In another PET study in the rat, [<sup>11</sup>C]-orexin A, a 33-amino acid peptide that is a potential treatment of narcolepsy, was injected in the nose in an unspecified volume using a Precision Olfactory Delivery system [<xref rid="B175-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. PET imaging showed the only part of brain exposed to the peptide was the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the injected naris [<xref rid="B175-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>].</p><p>In summary, when low volumes of drug are instilled into the nose, and local injury to the nasal mucosa is not produced, then there is little evidence for drug delivery to the olfactory CSF, much less the brain following trans-nasal drug delivery. Predictably, clinical trials in humans of trans-nasal drug delivery have failed to demonstrated selective drug distribution into CSF via the nasal route, as discussed in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>3.3.

In 1973, Brightman et al. [<xref rid="B185-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>] showed the disruption of the BBB following the intra-carotid arterial infusion of hypertonic urea caused the shrinkage of brain endothelial cells in association with opening of endothelial tight junctions. In 1979, three groups used hyperosmolar BBBD to enhance brain uptake of therapeutics such as methotrexate [<xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B186-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], or an enzyme [<xref rid="B187-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], following the intra-arterial infusion of a poorly diffusible hypertonic monosaccharide, mannitol or arabinose. BBB delivery of a drug across the disrupted BBB was shown to be dependent on MW, which is consistent with a pore mechanism associated with opening of tight junctions [<xref rid="B188-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Hypertonic BBBD caused an increase in brain ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and increased brain polyamines, and the disruption of the BBB was blocked by an ODC inhibitor, &#945;-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) [<xref rid="B189-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. BBBD mediated by arterial hyperosmolarity requires an intact BBB to establish the osmotic gradients across the endothelium. Consequently, the BBB in normal brain is disrupted to a greater extent than in a brain tumor, where there may be a pre-existing disruption of the BBB [<xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. This reduces the therapeutic index of the BBBD, as the toxic effect in normal brain is greater than the therapeutic effect in the brain tumor [<xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. These findings in an experimental rat brain tumor model [<xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] were replicated in humans with a malignant glial tumor [<xref rid="B191-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The BBB permeability&#8211;surface area (PS) product, also called the K<sub>1</sub>, was measured for 82-rubidium with PET scans of the brain. Intra-carotid arterial infusion of 25% (1.4 M) mannitol was performed for 30 s at high flow rates (360&#8211;720 mL/min) under anesthesia and seizure prophylaxis with phenobarbital or phenytoin.

In contrast to hyper-osmolar BBBD, which preferentially effects normal brain, as compared to brain tumor, the intra-arterial infusion of vasoactive agents, such as bradykinin analogues, preferentially opens the BBB in tumor as compared to normal brain [<xref rid="B192-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>], as discussed in the next section.</p><p>Hyperosmolar BBBD, in combination with intra-arterial methotrexate, was demonstrated to enhance survival in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) [<xref rid="B193-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>].

When the BBB is disrupted for the purpose of chemotherapeutic delivery to brain, virtually all substances in plasma, at least up to the size of the 420,000 Da fibrinogen, may also escape from blood to the brain ECS. Albumin is toxic to astrocytes, which can trigger a glial scar [<xref rid="B197-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>], and is pro-inflammatory [<xref rid="B198-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Fibrinogen activates oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which can lead to suppression of myelin production [<xref rid="B199-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. ICAHM induces a sterile inflammatory response (SIR) in brain, which is associated with activated astrocytes and microglia, an up-regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and trophic factors, and these changes are observed in the contralateral hemisphere, as well as the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the infusion [<xref rid="B200-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. A similar SIR is observed with ultrasound-induced BBBD [<xref rid="B201-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>], as discussed below.

BBBD with Intra-Arterial Bradykinin Analogs</title><p>The topical application of bradykinin (BK) to the pial surface of brain causes BBBD to small molecules such as fluorescein but not to large molecules such as albumin [<xref rid="B208-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Since topical application of BK to the surface of the brain induces a pharmacologic effect, it is inferred that the BK receptor is expressed on the abluminal side of the BBB. It is not practical to use BK as an agent to induce BBBD as this peptide is rapidly degraded and has a plasma T<sub>1/2</sub> of about 15 s, owing to first pass inactivation in the lung by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) [<xref rid="B209-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. A more metabolically stable analogue of BK was developed, RMP-7 [<xref rid="B210-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>], as an agent to induce biochemical BBBD, where RMP = receptor-mediated permeabilizer. Intra-carotid arterial administration of RMP-7 caused selective BBBD in an experimental brain tumor, as compared to normal brain [<xref rid="B211-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. This effect is opposite of hyperosmolar BBBD, which opens the BBB in normal brain to a much greater extent than in a brain tumor [<xref rid="B191-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Capillaries perfusing the core of brain tumors are often leaky, which enables intra-arterial BK analogues to access the BK receptors on the abluminal side of the BBB in brain tumors. The carotid arterial infusion dose of RMP-7 was 0.1 &#956;g/kg, as higher doses, 1 &#956;g/kg, caused hypotension [<xref rid="B211-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. In humans with malignant glioma, intra-arterial RMP-7, at a dose of 10&#8211;300 ng/kg, caused an increase in the PS product of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]-EDTA of 46 &#177; 42% as determined by PET [<xref rid="B212-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. The cause of the wide variability in the opening of the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) is not clear, but may be related to differences in the degree of disruption of the BTB in brain tumors. Intra-arterial RMP-7 caused no BBBD in normal brain in humans [<xref rid="B212-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>], which is consistent with an abluminal expression of the BK receptor.

RMT is discussed below in <xref rid="sec8dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1</xref>. In the absence of a targeting mechanism built into the exosome, then BBB transport is minimal, unless the exosome naturally expresses a targeting ligand, as discussed below. In an early study on the brain drug delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA), exosomes were prepared from bone marrow dendritic cells that had been permanently transfected with a cDNA encoding a fusion protein of lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) and a 29-amino acid peptide derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG). The RVG peptide is believed to trigger RMT across the BBB via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) [<xref rid="B297-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. However, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot7-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.7</xref>, the IHC of brain shows no expression of the nAChR at the brain endothelium.

The problem of encapsulating drugs into exosomes is the same as drug encapsulation in cells, and electroporation is required for a large molecule drug such as siRNA.

An alternative approach is to bind the drug to the surface of the exosome. This was performed for a siRNA therapeutic by engineering a fusion protein of the G58 domain of glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, which binds the surface of exosomes and a RNA binding protein, trans-activation-responsive RNA-binding protein 2 (TARBP2), which binds double-stranded RNA, such as siRNA [<xref rid="B300-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>]. A three-way complex was then formed by mixing the exosomes derived from either mesenchymal stem cells or human embryonic kidney 293T cells, the G58-TARBP2 fusion protein, and the siRNA.

The rapid clearance of exosomes from blood is the same pharmacokinetic (PK) problem that confounded early drug development of liposomes. After the IV administration of liposomes, the surface of the vesicles was coated by plasma proteins, which triggered uptake by cells lining the reticulo-endothelial system in liver and spleen.

Of these 38 most-prescribed CNS drugs, 66% are for psychiatric conditions, including depression, psychosis, anxiety, and hyperactivity, and 21% are for epilepsy. Therefore, 87% of the most-prescribed CNS drugs cover only two classes of CNS disorders, neuropsychiatric conditions and epilepsy. The MW of these CNS active drugs ranges from 135 Da to 448 Da, with a mean &#177; SD of 276 &#177; 77 Da. Only 2 of the 38 drugs have a MW between 400&#8211;450 Da. The number of hydrogen bonds formed by these 38 drugs ranges from 2&#8211;6, and only 2 drugs form 6 hydrogen bonds with water.

This conclusion is drawn from the following reviews on small molecule CNS drugs. A survey of &gt;6000 drugs in the Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry database shows that only 6% of drugs are active in the CNS, and these drugs are generally confined to the treatment of psychiatric conditions and insomnia [<xref rid="B311-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>].

The 2% figure is a compromise between the fraction of all drugs active in the brain, 6&#8211;12%, and the fraction of drugs active in non-psychiatric conditions of brain, 1%. The reason that so few drugs are active in the CNS is that the type of small molecule that crosses the BBB via free diffusion must exhibit two necessary properties: (a) a MW &lt; 450 Da [<xref rid="B313-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">313</xref>], and (b) a structure that forms less than eight hydrogen bonds [<xref rid="B314-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>].

Mechanism of Small Molecule Diffusion through the BBB</title><p>The mechanism of small molecule diffusion through the BBB is the same as that which governs solute-free diffusion through biological membranes. For many years, it was believed that membrane permeability was proportional to lipid solubility, as reflected in the partition of the drug in a model solvent such as 1-octanol. Thus, measurement of the octanol partition coefficient (K) should predict membrane permeability as governed by the model of solute diffusion developed by Overton in 1901 [<xref rid="B315-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>]. The Overton model makes no allowance for solute size or MW. In 1980 Levin [<xref rid="B316-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>] observed that BBB permeability of drugs was proportional to lipid solubility providing the MW of the drug was &lt;400 Da. This finding indicated that there was a threshold of MW governing BBB transport via free diffusion. The role of molecular size and MW in solute-free diffusion through lipid bilayers, as opposed to diffusion through a solvent, was formulated by Lieb and Stein [<xref rid="B317-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. The diffusion coefficient (D) of drug within a membrane was exponentially and inversely related to the size of the drug. The mechanism by which drug permeation through a biological membrane could be a function of solute size was put forward by Trauble in 1970 [<xref rid="B318-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. In this model, solutes penetrate a biological membrane by jumping through transitory holes in the membrane that are caused by the kinking of mobile fatty acyl side chains of membrane phospholipids, as depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>Solutes are hypothesized to traverse a biological membrane through a process of molecular &#8220;hitch-hiking&#8221;, through neighboring holes within the phospholipid bilayer until the solute traverses the membrane. The MW dependence of solute or drug free diffusion through a biological membrane is not predicted by the Overton model (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A), but is predicted by the Stein model (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B). If the MW or size of the drug is too large to fit into the membrane holes, then membrane permeation is decreased in proportion to molecular size. BBB permeability is decreased 100-fold when the cross-sectional area of the drug is increased from 52 &#197;<sup>2</sup> to a cross-sectional area of 105 &#197;<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B319-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. This exponential decrease in BBB permeation as the size of the drug increases comports with the models of Stein [<xref rid="B317-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>] and Trauble [<xref rid="B318-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>], as reviewed recently [<xref rid="B320-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the molecular volume of the drug, as reflected in the MW, the other important factor limiting small molecule movement through membranes is polarity of the drug, as reflected in the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the drug and solvent water [<xref rid="B317-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>,<xref rid="B321-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>].

The effect of hydrogen bonding on BBB transport is illustrated by the 1972 study of Oldendorf et al. [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The BBB transport of heroin, which is diacetylmorphine, is &gt;10-fold faster than the BBB transport of morphine [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The acetylation of the 2 hydroxyl groups converts morphine to heroin, and removes a total of 4 hydrogen bonds from the parent drug.</p><p>In summary, the likelihood of BBB transport of a given small molecule can be estimated from the MW and structure of the drug. If the MW &gt; 450 Da, and/or the structure of the drug includes polar functional groups that form &gt;7 hydrogen bonds, then the BBB transport of the drug will be low, in the absence of carrier-mediated transport. Conversely, if the MW &lt; 450 Da and the drug forms &#8804;7 hydrogen bonds with water, then the BBB transport of the drug may be significant, assuming the drug is not a substrate for an active efflux transporter, such as p-glycoprotein, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec6dot3dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.3.2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot1dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>6.1.3.

However, lipidization also increases drug uptake by peripheral tissues, which reduces the plasma AUC of the drug. The increase in PS product is offset by the reduced plasma AUC, which results in only minor changes in the brain uptake of the drug, or % injected dose (ID)/g brain.

A hydrophilic drug, which did not cross the BBB, was conjugated to the DHP carrier.

The three-dimensional structure of the GLUT1 transporter shows the transporter protein forms a trans-membrane cavity that can be alternately accessed by the substrate from either side of the plasma membrane.

The GLUT1 carrier is composed of 12 transmembrane regions (TMR), which form a carboxyl terminal domain and an amino terminal domain. TMRs 1&#8211;6 form the amino terminal domain, and TMRs 7&#8211;12 form the carboxyl terminal domain TMR. The outward open conformation is largely coordinated by Aas in the carboxyl terminal domain (C), whereas the inward open conformation is largely determined by AAs in the amino terminal domain (N) [<xref rid="B346-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">346</xref>].

The first LAT1 drug developed was L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) for PD, which was approved in 1970. L-DOPA crosses the BBB via LAT1 and is converted in brain to dopamine via the action of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). In 1959, Holtz [<xref rid="B362-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">362</xref>] reviewed the conversion of L-DOPA into dopamine by AAAD. In 1963, Yoshida et al.

In 1966, Hornykiewicz [<xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reviewed the low production of dopamine in the striatum of PD, and the ability of L-DOPA administration to increase brain dopamine, but did not mention either the BBB or how L-DOPA gains access to the CNS. In 1975, Wade and Katzman [<xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], using the Oldendorf BUI technique [<xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], demonstrated L-DOPA crosses the BBB on an amino acid transport system, and in 2000, Kageyama et al. [<xref rid="B364-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">364</xref>] showed that L-DOPA is a substrate for LAT1.

Melphalan was subsequently shown to be a ligand for LAT1 [<xref rid="B367-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">367</xref>]. Gabapentin, a &#947;-amino acid, was developed as a new anti-convulsant in the 1990s, and cerebral microdialysis showed gabapentin crossed the BBB, although no mention was made as to mechanism of transport [<xref rid="B368-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">368</xref>]. Using the frog oocyte expression system, the LAT1-mediated uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]-phenylalanine was blocked by amino acid-like drugs, and the Ki for melphalan, L-DOPA, and gabapentin was 49 &#181;M, 67 &#181;M, and 340 &#181;M, respectively [<xref rid="B367-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">367</xref>]. The transport of gabapentin, a &#947;-amino acid, by LAT1 is unexpected, since LAT1 transports &#945;-amino acids, not &#947;-amino acids. However, gabapentin is a cyclic compound wherein the amino and carboxyl moieties sterically resemble an &#945;-amino acid. A perplexing example of a drug that is said to be transported by a LNAA transporter is paraquat, which is a quaternary ammonium salt, and such molecules do not cross the BBB. Paraquat is a widely used herbicide, and there is inconclusive evidence that paraquat neurotoxicity can be associated with PD [<xref rid="B369-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">369</xref>]. Paraquat is structurally similar to the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), and MPP+ does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B370-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">370</xref>]. However, the SQ administration of 5&#8211;10 mg/kg paraquat results in drug distribution to brain via a process that is inhibited by a LNAA, L-valine, but not by a cationic amino acid, L-lysine [<xref rid="B370-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">370</xref>]. Paraquat transport via LAT1 has not been tested. While the cyclic structure of gabapentin provides an explanation for gabapentin transport via LAT1, the structure of paraquat has no resemblance to an &#945;-amino acid, and paraquat transport at the BBB may be mediated by a transporter other than LAT1.</p><p>The development of drugs that mimic the structure of a LNAA, and which are transported via LAT1, is the most advanced area of CNS drug development that targets a BBB CMT system.

To be effective in the CNS, a LNAA-type drug must not only bind to LAT1, but also undergo translocation through the membrane [<xref rid="B373-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>]. The second approach to the development of LNAA-type drugs that cross the BBB via LAT1 is executed without knowledge of the LAT1 binding site. Modifications to the LNAA structure are made and the affinity of the drug for LAT1 is then determined. An early example of the types of modifications to a neutral amino acid drug that can be made, and still retain LAT1 affinity, was the synthesis of 6-mercaptopurine-L-cysteine [<xref rid="B374-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>]. L-cysteine is a small neutral amino acid, which has a low affinity for the BBB LNAA transporter [<xref rid="B48-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, conversion of the free sulfhydryl group on L-cysteine to a disulfide linked therapeutic group converts L-cysteine to a LNAA, which has appreciable affinity for the BBB LNAA transporter in vivo [<xref rid="B374-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>].

However, mutations in the MCT8 gene in humans causes impaired neurodevelopment, a condition known as the Allan&#8211;Herndon&#8211;Dudley syndrome [<xref rid="B437-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">437</xref>], which indicates humans may not have an active alternative to the MCT8 pathway of thyroid hormone transport across the BBB, as discussed below.</p><p>A second thyroid hormone transporter is organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1c1, also known as oatp14, and now designated Slco1c1. This gene was originally cloned as part of a BBB genomics investigation [<xref rid="B438-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">438</xref>]. The new gene was named BBB-specific anion transporter 1 (BSAT1) because of a distant sequence homology with a liver specific anion transporter. The BSAT1 mRNA was not detected by Northern blotting in rat heart, lung, liver, kidney, or total brain, but was highly expressed in isolated rat brain capillaries [<xref rid="B438-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">438</xref>]. The sequence of the full length 2736 nucleotide cDNA of rat BSAT1 was deposited in GenBank in 2001 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="AF306546">AF306546</ext-link>), and this sequence encoded for a 716-amino acid protein. Expression of the mouse oatp14 cDNA in HEK293 cells showed this transporter mediated uptake of the estradiol &#946;-glucuronide (E<sub>2</sub>G) anion, but also mediated the uptake of T4 and T3 [<xref rid="B439-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">439</xref>]. Expression of the rat BSAT1/oatp14/Slco1c1 in HEK293 cells showed the Km of transport of T4 and E<sub>2</sub>G via BSAT1 was 0.72 &#177; 0.10 &#181;M and 6.1 &#177; 0.5 uM, respectively [<xref rid="B440-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">440</xref>]. T3 inhibited the transport of T4 and E<sub>2</sub>G with a Ki of 50 &#177; 17 &#956;M and 4.2 &#177; 0.7 &#181;M, respectively. Transport of T4, T3, and E<sub>2</sub>G via BSAT1 (Slco1c1) was asymmetric and consistent with transport via two sites [<xref rid="B440-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">440</xref>]. Site 1 transported T4, but not T3 or E<sub>2</sub>G, and site 2 transported T4, T3, and E<sub>2</sub>G. Using a prealbumin trap technique, the efflux of intracellular T4 was enhanced by the presence of E<sub>2</sub>G in the extracellular compartment [<xref rid="B440-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">440</xref>]. Prealbumin binds T4 with high affinity and prevented reuptake of T4 following efflux from the preloaded cell [<xref rid="B440-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">440</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody against Slco1c1 illuminated the microvessels in rat and mouse brain, but not in human brain [<xref rid="B436-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">436</xref>]. The absence of expression of immunoreactive Slco1c1 in microvessels of human brain was confirmed by qPCR analysis measuring the Slco1c1 mRNA in total brain and brain microvessels. The Slco1c1 mRNA was highly enriched at the brain microvessel compared to total brain for rat and mouse, but there was no enrichment of the Slco1c1 mRNA in human microvessels [<xref rid="B436-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">436</xref>]. Similarly, the Slco1c1 gene was repeatedly isolated in rat brain vascular genomic studies [<xref rid="B438-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">438</xref>,<xref rid="B441-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">441</xref>], but was not detected in a similar genomics investigation using microvessels isolated from fresh human brain obtained at neurosurgery [<xref rid="B442-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">442</xref>]. These species difference in Slco1c1 expression at the BBB in rodents vs. humans suggest that Slco1c1 may not be a suitable target for brain drug delivery in humans. The high expression of Slco1c1 at the rodent BBB, but not the human BBB, explains why MCT8 mutations cause cerebral hypo-thyroidism in humans, but not in mice [<xref rid="B437-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">437</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2dot9-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>6.2.9.

Carnitine is an amino acid betaine with a quaternary ammonium terminus. Carnitine is transported via the organic cation (OCTN)2 transporter (SLC22A5) [<xref rid="B443-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">443</xref>]. The transport of carnitine across the BBB in vivo is very low and comparable to sucrose [<xref rid="B444-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">444</xref>], although OCTN2 mediates carnitine uptake in human brain endothelium in cell culture [<xref rid="B445-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">445</xref>].

A recent proteomics study of OCT expression at the human brain microvessel showed that OCT-3 (SLC22A3) is the most abundant OCT transporter at the human BBB, with an expression level of 0.15 pmol/mg capillary protein [<xref rid="B447-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">447</xref>], a level that is about one-third the expression of LAT1 (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

HEK293 cells transfected with human OCT-3 were used in a high throughput screen of over 2000 compounds that are potential OCT-3 substrates by measuring the inhibition of the cell uptake of a model OCT-3 fluorescent substrate, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (pinaflavol), which is a quaternary ammonium compound [<xref rid="B447-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">447</xref>]. The investment of such a significant effort to find drugs that penetrate the BBB via transport on OCT-3 assumes that this transporter mediates the influx of drugs from blood to brain. This may not be the case as the striatal neurotoxin, MPP+, is transported via OCT-3 [<xref rid="B448-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">448</xref>], but MPP+ does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B370-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">370</xref>].</p><p>In summary, multiple CMT systems are expressed at the BBB that mediate the transport of nutrients, vitamins, thyroid hormones, and organic cations from blood to brain.

Since then, BBB transporters are now classified on a molecular basis within the context of the SLC gene superfamily. The molecular biology of the BBB CMT systems is now complex as there are &gt;400 members of the SLC transporter family. Therefore, it is crucial to show that the substrate transporter profile (STP) of the cloned SLC transporter mirrors the STP observed at the BBB with in vivo transport investigations. The expanded knowledge base of BBB transport via SLC carriers provides targets for solving current day brain drug delivery problems for small molecules. Solutions to the problem of BBB delivery of hydrophilic small molecules has, in the past, focused on the use of medicinal chemistry for the conversion of hydrophilic small molecules into lipid-soluble prodrugs. However, this had led to few FDA-approved drugs for the CNS, as reviewed above in <xref rid="sec6dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1</xref>. Instead, CNS drug developers can elucidate the STP of the individual BBB CMT systems both in vivo and with cloned transporters, and then use medicinal chemistry to convert hydrophilic small molecules into drugs that mimic the structure of endogenous ligands transported by the BBB CMT systems. Such work is ongoing in academic labs, particularly for LAT1, as reviewed above in <xref rid="sec6dot2dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.2.2</xref>. However, the pharmaceutical industry has yet to adopt this approach, as the industry continues to focus on the development of lipid-soluble small molecules that treat primarily only psychiatric disorders and epilepsy, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec6dot1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1.1</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>6.3.

Brain-to-Blood Efflux</title><p>The carrier-mediated SLC transporters reviewed in <xref rid="sec6dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.2</xref> enable the influx from blood to brain of specific classes of nutrients or vitamins. Brain-to-blood efflux across the BBB also takes place for excitatory neurotransmitters, such as the acidic amino acids, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>-glutamate and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>-aspartate, and for neurotransmitter metabolites, such as homovanillic acid (HVA), which is derived from catecholamine degradation. These molecules are polar and require access to specific efflux transporters in order to undergo exodus from brain-to-blood. Drugs may also be recognized by the endogenous BBB efflux transporters, which would adversely affect drug distribution to brain. An early study of drug efflux across the BBB was performed with the BUI technique, which showed the BBB permeability of valproic acid (VPA) in the brain-to-blood direction was several-fold greater than in the blood-to-brain direction [<xref rid="B449-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">449</xref>]. However, the saturability, or cross-competition of drug efflux, cannot be accessed with the BUI method. Terasaki and colleagues developed the Brain Efflux Index (BEI) method for the study of solute efflux from brain following the direct intra-cerebral injection under stereotaxic guidance [<xref rid="B450-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">450</xref>]. While the BEI method is generally used to study the efflux of small molecules, this method can also be used to examine the brain-to-blood transport of large molecules, such as IgGs or transferrin [<xref rid="B451-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">451</xref>,<xref rid="B452-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">452</xref>]. The BEI method is particularly useful to assess the BBB efflux of drugs. The brain efflux of two drugs used for HIV infection, azidothymidine (AZT) and dideoxyinosine (DDI), was measured with the BEI method [<xref rid="B453-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">453</xref>]. Both drugs effluxed from brain with a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 22&#8211;28 min, and AZT and DDI efflux was inhibited by organic anions, probenecid and p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). Other organic anions, such as the bile salt, taurocholate (TC), were demonstrated to undergo efflux across the BBB, and the TC efflux was inhibited by cholic acid and probenecid, but not by PAH [<xref rid="B454-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">454</xref>]. Acidic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, have the lowest rate of influx from blood to brain of any of the amino acids [<xref rid="B455-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">455</xref>]. The high rate of efflux of the acidic amino acid from brain to blood was demonstrated with the BEI method [<xref rid="B456-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">456</xref>]. Similarly, the BEI method characterized the efflux from brain of endogenous organic anions, such as estrone 3-sulfate (E3S), as well as the neutral estrogen, estrone (E1). The T<sub>1/2</sub> of efflux of either E3S or E1 from brain was about 10 min [<xref rid="B457-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">457</xref>]. The efflux of E3S across the BBB via free diffusion is nil, owing to the highly polar sulfate group. Therefore, efflux of the E3S would require access to a transporter, and this was demonstrated by the inhibition of E3S efflux by another endogenous organic anion, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) [<xref rid="B457-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">457</xref>]. E1 is a hydrophobic estrogen, and such unconjugated estrogens rapidly cross the BBB via free diffusion [<xref rid="B322-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>], but are reversibly sequestered in brain owing to binding to cytoplasmic proteins [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>]. In the absence of this sequestration, E1 should efflux from brain with a T<sub>1/2</sub> comparable to water, which is 1.1 min [<xref rid="B450-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">450</xref>]. However, the cytoplasmic binding of E1 in brain results in the prolonged brain residence time [<xref rid="B457-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">457</xref>], as discussed further in <xref rid="sec11dot5dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 11.5.2</xref>.

The rate of efflux of DHEAS was more than 10-fold faster than the rate of influx. The influx from blood to brain was restricted by the polar sulfate moiety of DHEAS, as the sulfate group converted the DHEA steroid to an organic anion and a substrate for organic anion transporters. The carrier-mediated efflux of DHEAS from brain to blood was inhibited by other organic anions, TC and E3S [<xref rid="B459-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">459</xref>]. An organic anion generated in the degradation of catecholamines is HVA, and HVA efflux from brain to blood is inhibited by other organic anions, probenecid and PAH [<xref rid="B460-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">460</xref>]. Anticonvulsants may undergo active efflux from brain to blood, as demonstrated for phenytoin [<xref rid="B461-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">461</xref>].

Ricin is composed of an A chain, which is the toxic domain, and an B chain, which binds cell surface carbohydrates to mediate endocytosis.

The IV administration of polycationic peptides can lead to death, which was demonstrated in the case of the K16ApoE peptide [<xref rid="B541-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">541</xref>]. The K16ApoE peptide is a 36-mer composed of 16 lysine residues (Lys or K) followed by a 16-AA sequence derived from human ApoE [<xref rid="B542-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">542</xref>]. Of the 36 AAs in this peptide, 24 are cationic amino acids (Lys, Arg). The Lys-rich domain of the peptide is intended to bind anionic domains of therapeutic proteins, which alone do not cross the BBB. The apoE peptide domain was intended to bind the ApoE receptor, to trigger receptor-mediated transcytosis through the BBB via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). However, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot6-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.6</xref>, the LDLR is not expressed on the microvascular endothelium of brain. Given the highly cationic charge of the K16ApoE peptide, the likely mechanism of BBB transport is either AMT via a charge mechanism, or BBB disruption caused by the highly cationic peptide. Similar to other cationic import peptides, the K16ApoE peptide is rapidly removed from plasma in &lt;5 min [<xref rid="B543-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">543</xref>]. In an attempt to deliver the TPP1 enzyme to brain in TPP1 null mice, the enzyme was co-injected with the K16ApoE peptide at a dose of 40&#8211;120 nmol of the peptide. The 120 nmol dose of K16ApoE was lethal in all animals [<xref rid="B541-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">541</xref>]. A dose of 40 nmol of the K16ApoE peptide increased brain uptake of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated TPP1. However, fluorescent microscopy of brain revealed a highly punctate distribution of the enzyme in brain [<xref rid="B541-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">541</xref>].

This suggests the K16ApoE peptide delivers enzyme to brain via BBB disruption, not RMT on a presumptive LDLR at the BBB. Neurotoxicty of CPPs may be a general property of these highly cationic agents.

First, ligands that traverse the BBB via AMT have dissociation constants (KD) of binding to the targets on the BBB in the &#956;M range, which is up to 3 log orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of ligands that traverse the BBB via RMT. Second, ligands that cross the BBB via AMT are largely sequestered within the endothelium with minimal exocytosis into brain parenchyma. A polycationic protein, histone, was nearly completely sequestered within the vascular compartment [<xref rid="B259-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. Cationized albumin is largely sequestered in the vascular compartment of brain [<xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Third, polycationic proteins or lectins are toxic with narrow therapeutic indices.

The tetrameric complex is formed by a dimer of TfR1s and two molecules of holo-Tf as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C. The TfR1 is synthesized as a 760-AA protein that includes an intracellular domain, AA 1&#8211;67, the transmembrane domain, AA 68&#8211;88, the stalk domain, AA 89&#8211;120, which forms two disulfide inter-chain bonds, two protease-like domains, AA 121&#8211;188 and AA 384&#8211;606, an apical domain, AA 189&#8211;383, and a helical domain, AA 607&#8211;760 [<xref rid="B554-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">554</xref>]. The ECD is formed by AA 121&#8211;760, which is a monomeric structure that lacks the stalk domain forming the inter-chain disulfide linked dimer. Transferrin (Tf) exists in plasma in three forms: about 40% is apo-Tf, which does not bind the TfR1 at physiologic pH, about 30% is monoferric holo-Tf, and about 30% is diferric holo-Tf [<xref rid="B554-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">554</xref>]. The affinity of diferric holo-Tf for the TfR1 is 8- to 9-fold higher than the affinity of mono-ferric Tf for the receptor [<xref rid="B575-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">575</xref>]. The Tf concentration in plasma is about 45,000 nM [<xref rid="B576-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">576</xref>], and the concentration of holo-Tf is about 25,000 nM. This plasma concentration of holo-Tf is nearly 1000-fold greater than the TfR1 concentration at the brain microvasculature, which is 40 nM [<xref rid="B559-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">559</xref>].</p><p>The high expression of the TfR at the brain microvasculature was shown in 1984 by immunohistochemistry of rat brain using the murine OX26 MAb against the rat TfR [<xref rid="B577-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">577</xref>]. In 1987, the BBB TfR was shown to mediate the transcytosis of Tf [<xref rid="B578-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">578</xref>], and the TfR at the human BBB was characterized by radio-receptor assays and isolated human brain microvessels [<xref rid="B579-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">579</xref>]. Subsequent work questioned whether Tf underwent transcytosis through the BBB, as opposed to a model of endocytosis of holo-Tf into the brain endothelium followed by retro-endocytosis of apo-Tf from the brain endothelium back to blood [<xref rid="B580-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">580</xref>,<xref rid="B581-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">581</xref>]. The evidence for this retro-endocytosis model was two-fold. First, the IV administration of dual labeled [<sup>59</sup>Fe, <sup>125</sup>I]-Tf in rats showed that the <sup>59</sup>Fe radioactivity accumulated in brain to a greater extent than the <sup>125</sup>I radioactivity [<xref rid="B580-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">580</xref>]. However, this observation is also consistent with a model of Tf transcytosis into brain followed by uptake of holo-Tf by brain cells, release of iron and reverse transcytosis of apo-Tf to blood. Support for this reverse transcytosis model was produced with the BEI method, which showed that both apo-Tf and holo-Tf undergo reverse transcytosis from brain to blood in vivo [<xref rid="B452-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">452</xref>]. In addition to reverse transcytosis of [<sup>125</sup>I]-apo-Tf, any <sup>125</sup>I-iodide released from [<sup>125</sup>I]-Tf in brain is rapidly exported from brain to blood [<xref rid="B582-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">582</xref>]. The second line of evidence used to support the reverse-endocytosis model was pre-embedding immune electron microscopy, which identified the TfR only on the luminal endothelial membrane, and not on the abluminal membrane [<xref rid="B583-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">583</xref>]. However, abluminal receptors are not detected with pre-embedding methods, and post-embedding techniques are required to visualize abluminal receptors [<xref rid="B515-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">515</xref>]. Confocal microscopy of unfixed rat brain capillaries identified the TfR on both luminal and abluminal brain capillary endothelial membranes [<xref rid="B584-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">584</xref>]. The Tf transcytosis model was further supported by electron microscopy of rat brain following a 10 min carotid artery infusion of the OX26 MAb conjugated with 5 nm gold particles [<xref rid="B585-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">585</xref>]. The gold-labeled antibody was observed bound to the luminal membrane, packaged within 100 nm intra-endothelial transcytotic vesicles, and exocytosed into the brain interstitial space [<xref rid="B585-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">585</xref>]. The transcytosis model was also confirmed with the internal carotid artery infusion of [<sup>125</sup>I]-rat holo-Tf in rats, followed by removal of the brain for thaw-mount emulsion autoradiography. This worked showed that holo-Tf penetrates well into brain parenchyma within just 5 min of arterial infusion [<xref rid="B586-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">586</xref>]. Holo-Tf distribution into the post-vascular brain was completely suppressed by infusion of the labeled Tf in 10% rat serum, which contains 2500 nM of holo-Tf [<xref rid="B586-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">586</xref>].</p><p>The TfR is also highly expressed at the choroid plexus epithelium, which forms the blood&#8211;CSF barrier.

The high expression of the TfR1 at the choroid plexus correlates with the high distribution of an MAb against the TfR1 into the CSF.

Targeting LRP1 for brain drug delivery assumes this receptor is expressed on the brain capillary endothelial membrane, including the luminal endothelial membrane.

The in vivo evidence is that LRP1 is expressed in brain, but not at the microvascular endothelium. Early immunohistochemistry (IHC) of human brain found LRP1 expression in neurons and astrocytes, but not in endothelium [<xref rid="B603-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">603</xref>].

The use of HFt as a BBB Trojan horse was evaluated with the use of iron magnetic nanoparticles [<xref rid="B640-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">640</xref>]. HFt or LFt shells were loaded with iron oxide at 65C to form the nanoparticles (NP).

The extent to which the brain uptake of HFt is mediated by the BBB TfR1 or BBB Tim-2 receptor in rodents is not known. There is little evidence that Tim-2 is expressed at the rodent BBB.

As described in a U.S. patent issued in 1989 [<xref rid="B645-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">645</xref>], a neuropeptide, somatostatin, which does not cross the BBB, was covalently conjugated to insulin, a ligand for the BBB insulin receptor, which resulted in enhanced uptake of somatostatin by isolated brain capillaries. Insulin is composed of two disulfide linked chains, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.1</xref>. This dual chain structure is not amenable to fusion protein technology. The A and B chains of insulin were connected by a dodecapeptide linker, which converted insulin into a single chain [<xref rid="B646-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">646</xref>]. The single chain form of insulin was genetically fused to albumin to form an insulin&#8211;albumin fusion protein, albondin. The insulin domain of albondin retained high affinity binding to the insulin receptor. The ED50 of binding to the HIR was 1.1 nM and 7.4 nM for insulin and albondin, respectively. This technology could be replicated for BBB delivery by fusion of the single chain form of insulin to another biologic that does not cross the BBB. A potential problem with such a fusion protein is that the insulin domain of the fusion protein would bind the insulin receptor in peripheral tissues, which may cause hypoglycemia.</p><p><bold>Transferrin receptor peptides.</bold> Transferrin (Tf) has been used as a Trojan horse for nanoparticle delivery across the BBB, as discussed below in <xref rid="sec9dot5dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.5.3</xref>. The problem with using Tf as a Trojan horse is the exogenous Tf Trojan horse must compete with the endogenous holo-Tf in plasma for binding to the BBB TfR. The concentration of holo-Tf in plasma, 25,000, is nearly 1000-fold higher than the concentration of the TfR1 at the BBB [<xref rid="B559-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">559</xref>]. Therefore, the BBB TfR1 is &gt;99.9% saturated with endogenous holo-Tf [<xref rid="B647-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">647</xref>]. Tf was conjugated to lysozyme in an effort to deliver this enzyme across the BBB, although no testing of the Tf-enzyme conjugate in vivo was reported [<xref rid="B648-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">648</xref>]. Tf-mimetic peptides that bind the TfR at a site spatially removed from the Tf binding site have been developed [<xref rid="B649-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">649</xref>]. One such peptide, designated 2DS25, bound to the human TfR1 ECD with a KD of 20 nM. However, the BBB transportability of the peptide was only tested in an in vitro model [<xref rid="B649-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">649</xref>]. An alternative strategy to the development of Tf-mimetic peptides is the discovery of cysteine rich peptides (CDP) that have an affinity for the TfR [<xref rid="B650-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">650</xref>]. Databases were searched for peptides of 30&#8211;50 Aas in length with 6&#8211;10 cysteine residues. Lead candidates, of 6 kDa in size, and designated TfRB1G2 and TfRB1G3, had a KD of binding to the TfR1 of 8.7 and 0.22 nM, respectively. After IV injection in the mouse, the CDP was cleared by organs with liver &gt; kidney &gt; spleen &gt;&gt; brain. The brain uptake of the CDP was 100-fold lower than the liver uptake, and measurable uptake by brain was not observed with whole body autoradiography [<xref rid="B650-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">650</xref>]. Nevertheless, the study concluded that the low brain uptake was pharmacologically significant, and a fusion protein of the 13-AA neuropeptide, neurotensin, and the CDP was observed to activate a cyclic AMP response element in brain following IV administration of 100 nmol/mouse [<xref rid="B650-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">650</xref>].

Melanotransferrin (MTf) was said to cross the BBB via LRP1 based on an in vitro BBB model [<xref rid="B601-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">601</xref>].

However, the angiopep-2 peptide has little to no affinity for LRP1. The ECD of LRP1 is composed of four domains, I, II, III, and IV. The KD of angiopep-2 binding to domains II or IV was &gt;1000 nM [<xref rid="B656-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">656</xref>]. In another study, binding of angiopep-2 to domains II or IV was not detectable [<xref rid="B657-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">657</xref>]. Angiopep-2 failed to increase brain uptake of either a lysosomal enzyme [<xref rid="B522-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">522</xref>] or liposomes [<xref rid="B631-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">631</xref>]. Lactoferrin (Lf) was said to cross the BBB via transport on LRP1 based on a cell culture model of the BBB [<xref rid="B658-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">658</xref>]. However, when Lf transport across the BBB was measured in vivo, the brain uptake of this protein is very low in the rat, 0.016%ID/g brain [<xref rid="B659-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">659</xref>], which is a level of brain uptake expected for a protein trapped in the brain plasma volume.

Another ligand of LRP1 is receptor associated protein (RAP), which was said to cross the BBB following IV administration of RAP labeled with <sup>125</sup>I and chloramine T [<xref rid="B654-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">654</xref>]. Based on the hypothesis that LRP1 was a RMT system expressed at the BBB, and that RAP was an endogenous ligand for this receptor, RAP-lysosomal enzyme fusion proteins were engineered for RMT delivery across the BBB [<xref rid="B661-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">661</xref>]. The fusion proteins were only validated by cell culture models, and there was no subsequent development of the RAP-lysosomal enzyme fusion proteins. Another ligand of LRP1 is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a 34 kDa protein associated with lipoproteins. In an effort to develop apoE peptidomimetics that are bound by LRP1, certain domains of apoE were synthesized as 15&#8211;20-AA peptides. Using an AA numbering system that does not include the signal peptide, ApoE(130&#8211;149) and ApoE(141&#8211;155) were synthesized [<xref rid="B662-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">662</xref>]. ApoE(130&#8211;149) bound to domains II and IV of LRP1 with a KD of 51 and 129 nM, respectively; ApoE(141&#8211;155) bound to domains II and IV of LRP1 with a KD of 118 and 190 nM, respectively [<xref rid="B662-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">662</xref>]. Both ApoE(130&#8211;149) and ApoE(141&#8211;155) are strongly cationic peptides and most likely enter cells via absorptive-mediated endocytosis, and not by RMT on LRP1. A peptide named COG-133 corresponds to ApoE(133&#8211;149) [<xref rid="B631-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">631</xref>].

The failure of the LRP1-targeted peptide Trojan horses to effectively deliver cargo to brain is consistent with the absence of expression of LRP1 on the endothelial luminal membrane (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>B), as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot5-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.5</xref>.</p><p><bold>LDLR peptides.</bold> Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB) binds the LDLR to trigger endocytosis of LDL into cells, and the LDLR is said to function at the BBB, based on cell culture studies [<xref rid="B610-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">610</xref>]. To develop a peptide-based Trojan horse targeting the LDLR, a phage peptide library was screened for candidates [<xref rid="B664-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">664</xref>], which led to the development of an 8-AA peptide, CMPRLRGC, designated VH434, that binds the LDLR with low affinity and a KD of 196 nM [<xref rid="B665-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">665</xref>]. This peptide was fused to the carboxyl terminus of a human IgG1 Fc and the VH434-Fc injected intravenously at 8 mg/kg in either wild-type or ldlr<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice [<xref rid="B665-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">665</xref>]. The brain/plasma ratio at 24 h was 2.2% and 1.1% in the wild-type and ldlr<sup>-/-</sup> mice, respectively.

As discussed in BBB Methods (<xref rid="sec11dot4dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 11.4.4</xref>), it is important to correct brain uptake, especially for biologics, for the brain plasma volume. The primary lipoprotein that binds the LDLR is apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB), which is a 500 kDa 4536-AA protein not counting the 27-AA signal peptide (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-protein" xlink:href="NP_000375">NP_000375</ext-link>).

The NMDAR was localized to the brain microvasculature using a monoclonal antibody designated Glunomab [<xref rid="B675-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">675</xref>]. This antibody was raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino terminal domain of the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR, which is a hetero-trimeric membrane protein. Fluorescent microscopy of the Glunomab immunoreactivity in brain microvessels is discontinuous [<xref rid="B675-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">675</xref>], which is consistent with expression in either endothelium or astrocyte endfeet.

An f3 phage library with random 15-mer sequences were infused in the carotid artery of mice, which resulted in identification of a 15-AA peptide, designated the GLA peptide [<xref rid="B681-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">681</xref>]. The GLA was conjugated to pegylated liposomes for delivery to cultured hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells, but uptake was low [<xref rid="B682-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">682</xref>]. It was reasoned that the conformation of the 15-mer peptide differed from the conformation adopted by this sequence within the p3 phage coat protein. The 15-mer sequence was incorporated in a peptide encompassing 240 AA of the amino terminal domain of the p3 coat protein, and this new peptide was designated, p3-GLA [<xref rid="B682-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">682</xref>]. Pegylated liposomes were targeted with either the GLA peptide or the p3-GLA peptide and incubated with cultured hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Liposomes targeted with the GLA peptide were not bound to the cells, whereas binding was detected with the p3-GLA peptide. It has been over 25 years since peptide phage display methods have been used to identify peptides that target the BBB. The problems with this approach are (a) the receptor targeted by the peptide is generally not known, (b) the BBB binding site identified has to be a RMT system, (c) the synthetic peptide may not have the same binding activity as the peptide sequence presented as part of the phage coat protein, and (d) oligopeptides invariably have low affinity for the targeted receptor.</p><p>In summary, peptide-based RMT Trojan horses typically work well in vitro in cell culture models, but are difficult to translate to in vivo brain delivery.

This led to the chimeric peptide hypothesis, wherein a peptide drug, which normally does not cross the BBB, could be linked to a ligand that normally undergoes RMT across the BBB [<xref rid="B58-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. By 1987, the RMT of insulin and Tf across the BBB via the IR and TfR, respectively, was demonstrated in vivo [<xref rid="B564-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">564</xref>,<xref rid="B578-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">578</xref>]. In addition to endogenous ligands, early work with the LDLR showed that a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that bound an exofacial epitope on the receptor could also be endocytosed into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref rid="B683-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">683</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were then shown to undergo RMT across the BBB via binding to either the rat TfR [<xref rid="B59-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or primate IR [<xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The hypothesis that biologics could have pharmaceutical effects in the brain following linkage of the biologic to a BBB RMT ligand [<xref rid="B58-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], was confirmed by in vivo pharmacologic studies using the OX26 TfRMAb [<xref rid="B684-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">684</xref>,<xref rid="B685-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">685</xref>]. In one model, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was conjugated to the OX26 TfRMAb with an avidin&#8211;biotin linker [<xref rid="B684-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">684</xref>]. VIP is a potent cerebral vasodilator when applied topically to brain surface vessels. The carotid arterial infusion of VIP had no effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) [<xref rid="B684-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">684</xref>], because VIP does not cross the BBB. However, infusion of the OX26-VIP conjugate resulted in a 65% increase in CBF in the parenchyma of brain, whereas there was no change in CBF following the infusion of VIP alone or OX26 alone [<xref rid="B684-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">684</xref>]. In another model, nerve growth factor (NGF) was chemically conjugated to the OX26 MAb and exerted trophic effects in an extra-cranial anterior eye transplant model [<xref rid="B685-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">685</xref>]. The 83&#8211;14 MAb against the human insulin receptor (HIR) cross-reacted with the IR of Old World primates such as the Rhesus monkey, and was rapidly transported across the primate BBB in vivo as the brain uptake of the HIRMAb was 2.5&#8211;3.8%ID/brain [<xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The use of the HIRMAb as a BBB Trojan horse was initially tested in Rhesus monkeys with the goal of developing a BBB-penetrating peptide radiopharmaceutical for imaging the brain amyloid of AD. The A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> amyloid peptide is a potential peptide radiopharmaceutical for imaging amyloid content in brain of AD [<xref rid="B686-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">686</xref>], but the A&#946; peptide does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B687-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">687</xref>]. [<sup>125</sup>I]-biotinyl A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> was conjugated to the HIRMAb with a streptavidin linker [<xref rid="B688-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">688</xref>]. Both the unconjugated [<sup>125</sup>I]-biotinyl A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> and the HIRMAb conjugated [<sup>125</sup>I]-biotinyl A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> avidly bound the amyloid plaques in autopsy AD brain [<xref rid="B688-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">688</xref>]. Following IV injection of the unconjugated [<sup>125</sup>I]-biotinyl A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> alone, no brain uptake could be detected by ex vivo brain imaging of the primate brain. In contrast, high resolution brain scans were observed following IV administration of the [<sup>125</sup>I]-biotinyl A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> conjugated to the HIRMAb [<xref rid="B688-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">688</xref>]. Brain radioactivity declined with a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 16 h in the primate [<xref rid="B688-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">688</xref>].</p><p>The OX26 TfRMAb is a species-specific antibody for the rat TfR and does not recognize the mouse TfR [<xref rid="B663-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">663</xref>] or the human TfR [<xref rid="B689-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">689</xref>]. The TfR in the mouse can be targeted with the 8D3 antibody, which is a rat MAb against the mouse TfR [<xref rid="B690-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">690</xref>], or the RI7-217 antibody, which is a rat MAb against the mouse TfR [<xref rid="B691-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">691</xref>]. Both the 8D3 and the RI7-217 antibodies are taken up by brain at a level of 1.6&#8211;3.1%ID/g following IV administration in the mouse [<xref rid="B663-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">663</xref>].</p><p>Biologics can be delivered to brain following the genetic fusion of the biologic and the MAb targeting an RMT system on the BBB. The engineering and expression of recombinant forms of the antibodies targeting the TfR or IR were enabled by the determination of the AA sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain (VH) and the variable region of the light chain (VL) for the OX26 TfRMAb [<xref rid="B692-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">692</xref>], the 8D3 TfRMAb [<xref rid="B693-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">693</xref>], and the 83-14 HIRMAb [<xref rid="B694-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">694</xref>]. The availability of these sequences allows for the genetic engineering of TfRMAb or HIRMAb fusion protein, as reviewed in the next section.</p><p><bold>Valency of TfRMAbs.</bold> The valency of the TfRMAb domain of the fusion protein has been both bivalent and monovalent. The first monovalent TfRMAb engineered was part of a bispecific antibody (BSA) composed of one monovalent arm as the TfRMAb domain, and another monovalent arm targeting the beta secretase 1 as the therapeutic domain [<xref rid="B695-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">695</xref>]. Engineering the TfRMAb domain in a monovalent form was obligatory since the BSA was engineered with a knob-in-hole technology [<xref rid="B695-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">695</xref>]. In contrast, the first BBB-penetrating BSA engineered was a tetravalent BSA, where both the transporter domain targeting the HIR was bivalent, and the therapeutic domain targeting the Abeta amyloid of AD was bivalent [<xref rid="B696-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">696</xref>]. The tetravalent BSA was engineered by fusion of a single chain form of the first antibody to the carboxyl terminus of each heavy chain of the second antibody [<xref rid="B696-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">696</xref>]. Engineering a BSA where both the therapeutic antibody domain and the transporter antibody domain are bivalent allows for retention of high avidity binding of the BSA at both the BBB receptor and the therapeutic antibody target in brain. Conversely, in the monovalent BSA, the monovalent TfRMAb had the expected reduced binding affinity for the TfR as compared to the bivalent TfRMAb [<xref rid="B695-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">695</xref>]. This reduced affinity was then considered advantageous and gave rise to the hypothesis that low affinity TfRMAbs were preferred BBB Trojan horses. The basis for this hypothesis was the observation that the uptake of the low affinity TfRMAb by brain was higher following the IV administration of a very high injection dose (ID) of 20&#8211;50 mg/kg of the TfRMAb. This high ID selectively saturates binding of the high affinity TfRMAb at the BBB, while not affecting binding of the low affinity TfRMAb. In another monovalent format of the TfRMAb domain of a BSA, a single chain TfRMAb was fused to the carboxyl terminus of a bivalent anti-Abeta antibody using the knob-in-hole technology [<xref rid="B697-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">697</xref>]. In this design of the BSA, the high-affinity bivalent structure of the therapeutic antibody is retained, whereas the transporter antibody is engineered as a moderate affinity monovalent antibody. The rationale for engineering the TfRMAb domain of the BSA in a monovalent format was that the bivalent TfRMAb would trigger dimerization of the TfR, which would redirect the receptor to the lysosome resulting in reduced expression of the TfR at the cell membrane [<xref rid="B697-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">697</xref>]. This hypothesis is curious since the TfR1 normally exists as a dimer (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C). If chronic administration of a TfRMAb led to down-regulation of the BBB TfR, then the rate of brain clearance of the antibody, as reflected by the permeability&#8211;surface area (PS) product, would be decreased after chronic treatment. This is not observed. Mice were chronically treated for 12 weeks with 2 mg/kg IV twice weekly with a fusion protein of the chimeric form of the 8D3 TfRMAb and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), designated cTfRMAb&#8211;GDNF [<xref rid="B698-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">698</xref>]. The BBB PS product of the cTfRMAb&#8211;GDNF fusion protein was unchanged from the start of treatment to the end of 12 weeks of treatment [<xref rid="B698-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">698</xref>]. In addition, the rate of plasma clearance of the fusion protein was unchanged with 12 weeks of treatment [<xref rid="B698-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">698</xref>], which indicates the TfR is not down regulated in peripheral tissues. In yet another monovalent format of a TfRMAb, the CH3 region of the antibody heavy chain was engineered by mutagenesis of multiple amino acids to create a new TfR binding site in the CH3 region [<xref rid="B699-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">699</xref>]. A lysosomal enzyme was fused to the amino terminus of a second antibody chain, and the two chains were combined by knob-in-hole technology [<xref rid="B699-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">699</xref>]. The monovalent format of the TfRMAb was said to be advantageous so as to avoid intracellular clustering and degradation of the TfR, which is observed following exposure of cultured hematopoietic cells to a bivalent TfRMAb [<xref rid="B700-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">700</xref>,<xref rid="B701-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">701</xref>]. However, these cell culture studies purporting to show intracellular clustering of a bivalent TfRMAb did not use a bivalent TfRMAb, per se, but rather a bivalent TfRMAb&#8211;avidin fusion protein. Such IgG&#8211;avidin fusion proteins form 400 kDa tetramers, owing to the dimerization of the avidin domain [<xref rid="B700-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">700</xref>,<xref rid="B702-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">702</xref>]. The apoptosis induced by the tetrameric TfRMAb&#8211;avidin fusion protein was not observed with the bivalent TfRMAb alone [<xref rid="B700-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">700</xref>]. Chronic administration to mice with a high affinity bivalent TfRMAb causes no down-regulation of brain TfR or brain iron [<xref rid="B703-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">703</xref>].</p><p>Apart from antibodies that target the TfR or IR, antibodies that target other BBB RMT systems, such as the LEPR or IGFR (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>B), are also potential new BBB MAb-based Trojan horses. Recently, single domain VHH antibodies against the ECD of the human IGF1R were isolated following Llama immunization [<xref rid="B704-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">704</xref>]. The VHH was fused to mouse Fc to generate either a monovalent or a bivalent format. Affinity for the human IGF1R was determined by SPR and the KD values ranged from 0.3 nM to 1.3 nM. BBB transcytosis was measured with an in vitro culture model as the primary model, although transcytosis was confirmed with carotid artery infusion and capillary depletion [<xref rid="B704-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">704</xref>]. The IGF1R antibody cross reacted with the antibody in rats and mice and IV administration of the bivalent form of the antibody showed distribution into both CSF and post-vascular brain [<xref rid="B704-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">704</xref>]. Leptin receptor (LEPR) antibodies are yet to be tested as BBB RMT agents. A panel of antibodies against the human LRPR ECD was isolated by panning a single chain Fv (ScFv) phage library with the human LEPR ECD [<xref rid="B705-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">705</xref>]. For isolation of a LEPR antibody that does not inhibit leptin binding to the LEPR, panning of phage libraries can be performed with complexes of the LEPR ECD and leptin so as to eliminate capture of antibodies that bind the leptin binding site on the LEPR.</p><p>In summary, receptor-specific MAbs are more effective BBB RMT Trojan horses than are peptides. Virtually any research lab can custom order their own lot of recombinant 8D3 TfRMAb for brain delivery in mice, recombinant OX26 TfRMAb for brain delivery in rats, or recombinant 83-14 HIRMAb for brain delivery in Old World primates or human cells, because the sequences of the VH and VL for these antibodies have been published [<xref rid="B692-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">692</xref>,<xref rid="B693-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">693</xref>,<xref rid="B694-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">694</xref>]. The production of recombinant antibodies based on these sequences has recently been described for a recombinant 8D3 TfRMAb [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>] or recombinant 83-14 HIRMAb [<xref rid="B707-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">707</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>8.3. IgG Fusion Proteins for Blood&#8211;Brain Delivery of Biologics</title><p>All four classes of biologics have been reduced to practice as either TfRMAb and HIRMAb fusion proteins, including therapeutic antibodies, lysosomal enzymes, neurotrophins, and decoy receptors [<xref rid="B708-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">708</xref>]. In the case of delivery of a therapeutic antibody to brain, the problem is engineering of a bispecific antibody (BSA), which includes a transporter antibody domain and a therapeutic antibody domain. There are multiple approaches to the genetic engineering of BBB-penetrating BSAs, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.4</xref>. In the case of brain delivery of a lysosomal enzyme, it is necessary to deliver the enzyme across both the BBB and the brain cell membrane, followed by triage of the IgG-lysosomal enzyme fusion protein to the lysosomal compartment [<xref rid="B709-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">709</xref>]. A lysosomal enzyme can be delivered across both the BBB and the brain cell membrane (BCM) with an antibody targeting the IR, TfR, LEPR, or IGFR, as these receptors are expressed on both the BBB and the BCM, as depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>B. The engineering of bi-functional HIRMAb or TfRMAb lysosomal enzyme fusion proteins is discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.1</xref>. In the case of neurotrophin delivery to brain, the neurotrophin receptor (NTR) is generally expressed on the plasma membrane of brain cells, so the IgG&#8211;neurotrophin fusion protein need only traverse the BBB to access the target neurotrophin receptor in brain. The engineering of bi-functional HIRMAb or TfRMAb neurotrophin fusion proteins is discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.2</xref>. In the case of decoy receptor delivery to brain, the cytokine target of the decoy receptor is generally secreted to the extracellular space of brain, so the IgG-decoy receptor need only cross the BBB to come in contact with the target inflammatory cytokine. The engineering of bi-functional HIRMAb or TfRMAb decoy receptor fusion proteins is discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.3</xref>.

The principal treatment for these conditions is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with weekly IV infusions of the recombinant enzyme. However, ERT does not treat the brain because the enzymes do not cross the BBB, owing to the absence of the cation independent mannose-6 phosphate (M6P) receptor (M6PR) on the BBB [<xref rid="B709-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">709</xref>]. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type I (MPSI), also called Hurler syndrome, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, &#945;-L-iduronidase (IDUA).

However, in 2022, the primary treatment of infants &lt;16 months of age diagnosed with neuronopathic MPSI, also called Hurler syndrome, is stem cell transplant [<xref rid="B291-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. The problem with stem cell transplant as a treatment of the brain, as discussed in <xref rid="sec5dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 5.1</xref>, is that stem cells do not cross the BBB.</p><p>In an effort to develop a treatment of the brain in MPSI, the IDUA lysosomal enzyme was re-engineered to enable BBB transport via RMT on the brain capillary insulin receptor. A fusion protein of human IDUA and the chimeric HIRMAb was engineered, wherein the IDUA enzyme, minus the enzyme signal peptide, was genetically fused to the carboxyl terminus of each heavy chain of the chimeric HIRMAb [<xref rid="B714-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">714</xref>].

The impact on brain uptake of fusion of IDUA to the BBB-penetrating HIRMAb was examined in the adult Rhesus monkey.

The first neurotrophin clinical trials tested the effects of either brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), wherein the neurotrophin was administered by subcutaneous (SQ) administration.

CNS drug developers are reluctant to discuss the BBB if they have no solution to the intractable problem of brain drug delivery.</p><p>Apart from chronic disease such as ALS or PD, neurotrophins could also be potent drugs for acute brain disease, such as acute stroke.

However, EPO does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B733-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">733</xref>].

Fusion of the EPO to the HIRMAb had 2 beneficial effects. First, fusion to the HIRMAb enabled EPO to enter the primate brain with a brain uptake of 2.1 &#177; 0.1%ID/brain. Conversely, the brain uptake of EPO alone was comparable to a brain plasma volume marker, an IgG1 isotype control antibody, which indicated EPO is retained in the brain plasma volume and does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B733-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">733</xref>]. Second, fusion of EPO to the HIRMAb resulted in a 13-fold reduction in the plasma AUC of EPO [<xref rid="B733-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">733</xref>]. Since the hematopoietic effect of EPO is proportional to the plasma AUC [<xref rid="B769-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">769</xref>], EPO fusion to the HIRMAb reduces the hematopoietic effect of the EPO domain by 13-fold.

However, as discussed in <xref rid="sec1dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 1.1</xref>, it is expected than any antibody in plasma will enter into the CSF compartment owing to the leakiness of the choroid plexus, which forms the blood&#8211;CSF barrier, and that antibody penetration into CSF provides no information on BBB transport of the antibody. The important predictor of success in a CNS trial is not whether the biologic enters CSF, but whether the biologic crosses the BBB to enter brain, as demonstrated by in vivo methods reviewed in <xref rid="sec11-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 11</xref>.

Following the failure of the bapineuzumab trial, another AAA, aducanumab, was developed [<xref rid="B790-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">790</xref>]. Aducanumab was said to cross the BBB because the brain concentration increased as the injection dose (ID) was increased.

The measurement of aducanumab in brain was determined after washout of the brain vasculature [<xref rid="B790-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">790</xref>]. However, the brain/plasma ratio of aducanumab was 1 &#181;L/g, which is 5&#8211;10% of the brain blood volume, and is indicative of incomplete washout of the brain [<xref rid="B786-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">786</xref>]. Nevertheless, in clinical trials of AD subjects, the entry of aducanumab into the brain of these patients could be inferred, because antibody treatment reduced the amyloid plaque in brain [<xref rid="B790-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">790</xref>]. The mechanism of aducanumab entry into the brain of AD subjects appears to be BBB disruption. A known side effect of AAA therapy in AD is amyloid related imaging abnormalities of edema (ARIA-E) as determined by MRI [<xref rid="B790-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">790</xref>]. ARIA-E is a form of vasogenic edema that follows BBB disruption. In the aducanumab clinical trial, there is a direct relationship between the reduction in amyloid plaque and the ARIA-E, which suggests the aducanumab enters brain through a disrupted BBB [<xref rid="B786-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">786</xref>]. The hypothesis that ARIA-E is required to cause a reduction in amyloid plaque is consistent with the clinical effects of another AAA, crenezumab, which does not cause ARIA-E [<xref rid="B791-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">791</xref>] and does not reduce brain amyloid plaque [<xref rid="B792-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">792</xref>].

To enable preclinical studies in AD transgenic mice, the anti-Abeta ScFv was fused to the carboxyl terminus of each heavy chain of the 8D3-derived TfRMAb, and this BSA retained high affinity binding to both the mouse TfR and A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> [<xref rid="B794-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">794</xref>].

Abeta fibrils in brain were measured by immunohistochemistry with the 6E10 MAb and total amyloid plaque in brain was measured by thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy.

The ARIA-E in AD subjects treated with an AAA [<xref rid="B790-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">790</xref>] is equivalent to the cerebral microhemorrhage in mice treated with an AAA [<xref rid="B795-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">795</xref>].

A BSA was engineered that targeted both the TfR and BACE1 as a treatment for AD [<xref rid="B695-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">695</xref>,<xref rid="B742-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">742</xref>]. This BSA was engineered with the knob-in-hole technology which placed both the TfRMAb transporting antibody and the BACE1 therapeutic antibody each in a monovalent format. A BSA that targeted both the TfR and the Abeta amyloid peptide was engineered with knob-in-hole technology by fusion of a single chain Fab form of the TfRMAb to the carboxyl terminus of one heavy chain (HC) of a hetero-tetrameric antibody against Abeta [<xref rid="B697-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">697</xref>]. This design placed the TfRMAb in a monovalent form and the AAA in a bivalent format. In a modified tetravalent BSA format, the 8D3 TfRMAb was engineered as a ScFv, which was then fused to the carboxyl terminus of each light chain (LC) of the AAA, mAb158 [<xref rid="B796-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">796</xref>], or an &#945;-synuclein MAb [<xref rid="B744-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">744</xref>]. The mAb158 is the murine precursor to the BAN2401 AAA for AD [<xref rid="B797-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">797</xref>]. Several therapeutic antibodies were re-engineered as a TfRMAb-based BSA using a dual variable domain format where the VH and VL for each antibody was placed in tandem at the amino terminus of each HC and LC [<xref rid="B798-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">798</xref>]. Owing to steric hindrance by the outer domain antibody, the affinity of the inner domain antibody was reduced [<xref rid="B798-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">798</xref>].

Oligopeptides may no longer bind the cognate receptor after fusion to a BBB Trojan horse even if a long linker is employed. Nucleic acid pharmaceuticals cannot be fused to a polypeptide. It is possible to deliver oligopeptides or antisense agents across the BBB with RMT technology that is combined with a linker system, such as avidin&#8211;biotin technology. In this approach, the pharmaceutical is formulated in two vials. The first vial contains the mono-biotinylated peptide or antisense agent. The second vial contains a fusion protein of avidin and the IgG RMT Trojan horse, which is generated by the genetic engineering of an IgG&#8211;avidin fusion protein.

Antisense agents are either phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASO), phosphorothioate ASOs, or peptide nucleic acids (PNA). Phosphodiester ASOs are not suitable agents for in vivo use, owing to the rapid degradation of phosphodiester ASOs by endo- and exo-nucleases in vivo. Phosphorothioate ASOs are more resistant to nucleases, but are not suitable imaging agents because binding of a phosphorothioate ASO to a target mRNA forms a DNA:RNA heteroduplex, which triggers mRNA degradation by RNase H [<xref rid="B812-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">812</xref>].

There is no direct evidence that even small nanoparticles can fit through these CMT cavities. The SLC carriers do not mediate endocytosis, as is the case for the RMT systems, which means there is no plausible mechanism by which nanoparticles can be transported by the CMT systems. The counter argument is that certain viruses, which have a size comparable to a nanoparticle, enter cells by first binding a CMT system.

The S1 domain of the virus spike protein binds the cell membrane receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Binding to ACE2 alone does not trigger endocytosis of the virus. After ACE2 binding, the spike protein is cleaved by furin into the separate S1 and S2 subunits, and the cleaved S2 subunit fuses with the cell membrane to enable virus endocytosis [<xref rid="B885-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">885</xref>].

Pegylated mesoporous silica nanoparticles were conjugated with the rat RI7-217 antibody against the mouse TfR, and BBB transport was demonstrated in cell culture using the mouse bEND5 cells and in vivo in the mouse using fluorescent microscopy [<xref rid="B900-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">900</xref>]. BBB transport of nanoparticles in the mouse was investigated with AuNPs conjugated with the rat 8D3 antibody against the mouse TfR [<xref rid="B901-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">901</xref>].

It was hypothesized that the 8D3 conjugated AuNPs were not released by the abluminal TfR into the brain parenchyma [<xref rid="B901-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">901</xref>]. However, it is not expected that gold particles in the post-vascular brain could be visualized at the EM level, owing to the volumetrics of the brain. As discussed in an early 1994 study on the EM of rat brain following carotid arterial infusion of a 5 nm gold-OX26 conjugate [<xref rid="B585-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">585</xref>], the volume of the brain extracellular space, 200 &#181;L/g, is 250-fold greater than the volume of the brain endothelial compartment, 0.8 &#181;L/g. Therefore, the gold particles undergo a 250-fold dilution subsequent to exocytosis at the abluminal membrane.</p><p><bold>Insulin receptor antibody-targeted nanoparticles.</bold> THLs were targeted with a MAb against the human insulin receptor (HIR), which cross reacts with the insulin receptor of Old World monkeys, and the HIRMAb-targeted THLs were encapsulated with a &#946;-galactosidase expression plasmid.

Another antibody against the HIR, the 29B4 antibody, was incorporated in albumin nanoparticles, and the 29B4 conjugated nanoparticles produced analgesia following IV administration in mice [<xref rid="B904-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">904</xref>]. These results are difficult to interpret, because the 29B4 antibody is directed against the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the beta subunit of the HIR [<xref rid="B905-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">905</xref>], and this TK domain is localized within the intracellular region of the HIR (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>B). An antibody in plasma cannot access the epitope on the receptor that is localized within the intracellular compartment. Antibodies used as BBB RMT Trojan horses bind exofacial epitopes on the extracellular domain of the receptor, which are accessible to the blood-born antibody. The extracellular domains of either the HIR or the human TfR1 are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p><bold>Transferrin- and lactoferrin-targeted nanoparticles.</bold> Nanoparticles have been conjugated with transferrin (Tf) for brain drug delivery [<xref rid="B906-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">906</xref>,<xref rid="B907-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">907</xref>,<xref rid="B908-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">908</xref>,<xref rid="B909-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">909</xref>]. The problem with using Tf as a Trojan horse is that the exogenous Tf, conjugated to the nanoparticle, must compete with the endogenous Tf in plasma. The concentration of holo-Tf in plasma, 25,000 nM, is nearly 1000-fold greater than the concentration, 40 nM, of the TfR1 at the BBB [<xref rid="B559-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">559</xref>]. Therefore, the BBB TfR is &gt;99.9% saturated with endogenous Tf. For this reason, a TfRMAb Trojan horse, which binds the apical region of the TfR (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C), a site spatially removed from the holo-Tf binding site, is the preferred type of TfR Trojan horse. The other factor to consider in the use of Tf as a Trojan horse is the iron content of the Tf. Apo-Tf does not bind the TfR at physiological pH, and mono-ferric Tf binds the TfR with an 8- to 9-fold lower affinity than the di-ferric form of Tf [<xref rid="B575-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">575</xref>]. Iron loading of Tf to produce di-ferric Tf has been described [<xref rid="B586-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">586</xref>]. Lactoferrin (Lf) has been conjugated to polymeric nanoparticles for brain drug delivery [<xref rid="B908-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">908</xref>]. The problem with using Lf as a Trojan horse is that Lf is a ligand for LRP1, and LRP1 is not expressed at the luminal endothelial membrane, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot2dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.2.1</xref>.</p><p><bold>Folic acid-targeted nanoparticles.</bold> Stearic acid SLNs were incorporated with a conjugate of stearic acid and folic acid [<xref rid="B910-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">910</xref>]. The folate conjugated SLNs incorporated docetaxel and ketoconazole, both highly water insoluble chemotherapeutic agents, which are favored agents for SLN delivery. The use of folic acid as a BBB Trojan horse assumes the folate receptor (FOLR1, <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) is the principal folate transporter at the BBB. Folate is also transported by the reduced folate carrier (FRC). There is evidence for expression at the BBB of both the FOLR1 [<xref rid="B427-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">427</xref>], which is an RMT system, and the FRC [<xref rid="B426-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">426</xref>], which is a CMT system, as discussed in <xref rid="sec6dot2dot7-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.2.7</xref>. If FOLR1 is the primary folate transporter at the BBB, then folate conjugated nanoparticles may undergo RMT across the BBB. However, the FRC is a CMT system, and if FRC is the primary BBB transporter for folic acid, then it is unlikely that folate conjugated nanoparticles may traverse the BBB via very narrow cavity of a CMT system, as discussed in <xref rid="sec9dot5dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.5.1</xref>.</p><p><bold>Dual receptor targeting of nanoparticles.</bold> The dual receptor targeting of pegylated liposomes was reported in 2002 using both the 8D3 antibody, for targeting the mouse TfR, and the 83-14 antibody, for targeting the HIR in an experimental intra-cranial human glioma model in the mouse [<xref rid="B911-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">911</xref>]. These dual targeted THLs are discussed further in <xref rid="sec10dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 10.2</xref>. Subsequently, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes were dual targeted with the RI7-217 rat antibody against the mouse TfR, and phosphatidic acid, which targets the Abeta amyloid peptide of AD [<xref rid="B912-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">912</xref>]. However, BBB transport of the liposomes was evaluated in culture with human hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells, which express the human TfR, and the human TfR is not recognized by the RI7-217 antibody [<xref rid="B691-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">691</xref>].

[<xref rid="B297-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. However, CNS uptake of the PLGA nanoparticles was not enhanced by the RVG peptide [<xref rid="B914-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">914</xref>], which is consistent with the lack of expression of the putative RVG receptor, the nAChR, at the brain endothelium as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot7-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.7</xref>. Pegylated SLNs were targeted with the apoE141-150 peptide, which corresponds to AA 141-150 of the human apolipoprotein E (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-protein" xlink:href="P02649">P02649</ext-link>), on the assumption this ligand would trigger RMT across the LDLR at the BBB [<xref rid="B915-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">915</xref>]. However, fluorescent microscopy showed the apoE-targeted SLNs did not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B915-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">915</xref>], which is consistent with the lack of expression of the LDLR at the BBB in vivo, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot6-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.6</xref>.

The sequence of the apoE141-150 peptide is LRKLRKRLLR, which has a pI of &gt;10. To the extent this peptide mediates BBB transport, the mechanism is most likely not RMT via a LDLR, but rather AMT owing to the highly cationic charge of the peptide.</p><p>In summary, NP functionalization with ligands that trigger RMT across the BBB is necessary because NPs alone do not cross the BBB, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec9dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.2</xref>, <xref rid="sec9dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.3</xref> and <xref rid="sec9dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.4</xref>. The importance of functionalization of nanomedicines for transport across vascular barriers has been recently reviewed [<xref rid="B917-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">917</xref>]. Functionalization with ligands that promote NP transport via CMT is not effective, as the NPs cannot fit within the narrow transport cavities of a CMT, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec9dot5dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.5.1</xref>. Delivery of NPs via AMT is not optimal, owing to the high degree of sequestration of the NP within the endothelial compartment of brain following endocytosis via an AMT process, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec9dot5dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.5.2</xref>. The optimal approach to NP functionalization for brain drug delivery is the incorporation on the NP surface of receptor-specific MAbs that trigger RMT of the NP across the BBB. However, the TfR-specific MAbs, e.g., the rat 8D3 MAb against the mouse TfR, the rat RI7-217 MAb against the mouse TfR, or the mouse OX26 MAb against the rat TfR, are species-specific. The OX26 TfRMAb does not recognize either the mouse TfR [<xref rid="B663-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">663</xref>] or the human TfR [<xref rid="B689-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">689</xref>]. The RI7-217 TfRMAb does not recognize the human TfR [<xref rid="B691-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">691</xref>], and has not been shown to bind with high affinity to the rat TfR. Therefore, it is important to match the species specificity of the TfRMAb with the species of the animal model or the species of origin of cells in culture.</p></sec><sec id="sec9dot5dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>9.5.4. Brain Delivery of Nanoparticles with BBB Avoidance Strategies</title><p>Nanoparticles do not cross the BBB in the absence of a BBB delivery technology (<xref rid="sec9dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.2</xref>, <xref rid="sec9dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.3</xref> and <xref rid="sec9dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 9.4</xref>). In the absence of re-formulating the nanoparticles with a receptor-specific ligand to enable RMT at the BBB, one of the BBB avoidance strategies must be employed. These include convection-enhanced diffusion (CED) (<xref rid="sec2dot2dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.2.2</xref>), trans-nasal delivery (<xref rid="sec3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>), and BBBD with focused ultrasound (<xref rid="sec4dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 4.2</xref>). In an early study of CED and nanoparticles, camptothecin loaded PLGA PNPs were infused into the brain for 30 min by CED 7 days after implantation of a 9 L intra-cranial glioma in Fischer CD344 rats [<xref rid="B918-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">918</xref>]. The infusion of a dose of 0.25 mg of the camptothecin had no effect on survival, although the infusion of a dose of 0.5 mg camptothecin in the PNPs increased median survival from 17 to 22 days. As reviewed in <xref rid="sec2dot2dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.2.2</xref>, clinical trials with the CED delivery system for brain conditions have failed. Therefore, in an effort to enhance drug distribution into the brain following CED, PLGA nanoparticles, with or without pegylation, were infused in the brain via CED in either isotonic (0.9%) or hypertonic (3%) saline [<xref rid="B919-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">919</xref>]. The combination of pegylation of the PLGA PNPs, drug administration via CED, and the infusion of 3% hypertonic saline increased the distribution of the infusate in brain. This effect is presumed to be due to shrinkage of brain cells owing to osmotic fluid shifts in brain caused by the hypertonic saline infusion. Brain delivery of nanoparticles via the trans-nasal route was examined in mice following the nasal instillation of 5 &#181;L/nostril of a microemulsion of clobazam [<xref rid="B920-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">920</xref>].

As reviewed in <xref rid="sec3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, such molecules may gain access to brain following nasal instillation by first passing from the nose to the blood compartment and then entry into brain across the BBB. In another study of nasal delivery of nanoparticles, paclitaxel was formulated in PLGA PNPs and infused into the nose in large volumes of 25 &#181;L in each nostril in the mouse with a pressurized olfactory device [<xref rid="B922-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">922</xref>].

As reviewed in <xref rid="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2</xref>, this instillation of such a large volume causes local injury to the nasal mucosa.

The size of the AuNPs varied from 3 nm to 15 nm to 120 nm. The dose of the microbubbles was 8 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> per mouse IV, and the acoustic pressure used was 0.5&#8211;0.7 MPa.

As discussed in <xref rid="sec4dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 4.2</xref>, the FUS/microbubble form of BBBD creates pores at the BBB owing to opening of tight junctions.

The cationic liposomes were formed from a 1:1 mixture of a cationic lipid, N-[1-(2,3,-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride, also known as DOTMA, and a helper lipid, dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine, also known as DOPE, and these agents, or variants, are still used today, and widely known as Lipofectamine<sup>&#174;&#174;</sup>. Lipofection is performed in many labs to produced transgene expression in cultured cells. However, the translation of in vitro lipofection to gene therapy in vivo proved to be difficult. Following IV administration of a reporter gene complexed with cationic liposomes, the transgene was effectively expressed only in the lung, as transgene expression in this organ was several log orders greater than transgene expression in liver or other organs [<xref rid="B1018-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1018</xref>,<xref rid="B1019-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1019</xref>,<xref rid="B1020-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1020</xref>,<xref rid="B1021-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1021</xref>].

While this aggregation of DNA lipoplexes is useful for cell culture, the aggregation limits the utility of in vivo gene therapy with cationic liposomes.

A recent review of nucleic acid delivery with lipid nanoparticles (LNP), which is a generic term for pegylated liposomes, makes no reference to the need for functionalization of the LNP with a targeting ligand to enable receptor-mediated uptake into cells, apart from the presumed coating of the surface of the LNP with apoE in plasma [<xref rid="B1037-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1037</xref>]. The incorporation of short chain pegylated lipids on the surface of the LNP is advocated, so as to facilitate rapid dissociation of this PEG-lipid in vivo in plasma [<xref rid="B1037-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1037</xref>]. The dissociation of the pegylated lipid from the surface of the liposome is said to enable fusion of the liposome with the plasma membrane, which then initiates endocytosis of the nucleic acid encapsulated in the liposome into the cell [<xref rid="B1037-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1037</xref>]. This approach of deploying short chain pegylated lipids, so as to enhance dissociation of the PEG lipid in vivo, is opposite of the design of THLs, where long chain pegylated lipids are incorporated on the surface of the liposome for conjugation of the targeting MAb at the tip of the pegylated lipid [<xref rid="B1036-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1036</xref>]. Early dissociation of the lipid-PEG-MAb from the surface of the THL would eliminate RMT of the THL across the BBB.

THLs were initially produced from 96% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 3% 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 2000 Da (DSPE-PEG<sup>2000</sup>), 1% dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDAB), and 0.15% DSPE-PEG<sup>2000</sup>-maleimide [<xref rid="B1035-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1035</xref>]. The DDAB has a cationic charge, but the DSPE-PEG<sup>2000</sup> has an anionic charge, so the THL has a net negative charge. In parallel, the targeting MAb is thiolated with a reagent such as 2-iminothiolane. The thiolated receptor-specific MAb is conjugated to the maleimide group of the PEG<sup>2000</sup> on the liposome surface to form a stable thio-ether bond. Typically, each THL incorporates ~50 MAb molecules per liposome, and each THL encapsulates a single double stranded plasmid DNA in the interior of the liposome, such that the DNA is protected from nucleases. For dual receptor targeting, two MAb molecules of different receptor specificity may be conjugated to the THL surface so as to engage two different cell membrane receptors, as discussed below. Binding of the MAb domain of the THL to the cell membrane receptor triggers receptor-mediated transcytosis of the THL across the BBB, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis into brain cells.

In this study, a plasmid DNA encoding an antisense RNA against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was labeled with fluorescein by nick translation and fluorescein-12&#8211;2&#8242;-deoxyuridine-5&#8242;-triphosphate [<xref rid="B1040-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1040</xref>], and incorporated in THLs targeted with a MAb against the human insulin receptor, and designated the HIRMAb.

By 6 h, the majority of the DNA is in the cytosolic compartment, although transgene is visible in the nucleolus of the nucleus at 6 h.

Following RMT of the THL across the BBB, and following insulin receptor-mediated endocytosis of the THL into brain cells, the liposome cargo must then be delivered to the nuclear compartment for gene expression.

TH gene therapy in PD only replaces the TH deficiency, but does nothing to abort the neurodegeneration of the nigral-striatal tract in PD. GDNF is a potent nigral-striatal neurotrophin [<xref rid="B1058-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1058</xref>]. So as to restrict GDNF gene expression in the brain to the nigral-striatal tract, the cDNA encoding human prepro GDNF was placed under the influence of the 8.4 kb 5&#8242;-FS of the rat TH gene, and the size of the expression plasmid was 13 kb [<xref rid="B1059-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1059</xref>].

The expression in brain of the TH gene is restricted primarily to the nigral-striatal tract that degenerates in PD, so the TH promoter allows for region-specific GDNF gene expression in this region of brain.</p><p>In summary, tissue-specific gene expression following IV administration of plasmid DNA is possible with the combined use of tissue-specific gene promoters and THL plasmid DNA delivery technology.

In addition to the use of tissue-specific promoters, another goal in gene therapy is production of high levels of expression of the transgene. Gene expression can be enhanced by insertion of 5&#8242;-untranslated region (UTR) and 3&#8242;-UTR elements flanking the open reading frame of the transgene. The interaction of the 5&#8242;-UTR and 3&#8242;-UTR elements can have synergistic effects on gene expression. When a 171 nt 5&#8242;-UTR or a 200 nt 3&#8242;-UTR from the GLUT1 mRNA was inserted 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; in a luciferase expression cassette, transgene expression was increased 10-fold and 6-fold, respectively [<xref rid="B1060-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1060</xref>]. However, when the luciferase expression cassette contained both GLUT1 mRNA 5&#8242;-UTR and 3&#8242;-UTR elements, transgene expression was increased 59-fold [<xref rid="B1060-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1060</xref>]. The more the therapeutic gene expression cassette is modified with tissue-specific promoters or 5&#8242;-UTR or 3&#8242;-UTR elements, the greater the size of the expression cassette. The construction of advanced expression cassettes of larger size is not possible with AAV gene therapy, given the limited size of the expression cassette that can be inserted in the AAV backbone, e.g., &lt;4.7 kb for incorporation in ssAAV, and &lt;2.1 kb for incorporation in scAAV [<xref rid="B998-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">998</xref>], as discussed in <xref rid="sec10dot1dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 10.1.4</xref>.

The treatment with the GFAP-TH plasmid encapsulated in OX26 TfRMAb-THLs normalized the immunoreactive TH in striatum of the PD rats (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f017" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref>V,X), whereas there was no therapeutic effect in PD rats treated with the GFAP-TH plasmid encapsulated in IgG<sub>2a</sub>-THLs (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f017" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref>W,Y).</p><p>The therapeutic effect of THL-mediated TH enzyme replacement in experimental PD lasts only 1 week [<xref rid="B1039-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1039</xref>], owing to degradation of the plasmid DNA in brain [<xref rid="B1051-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1051</xref>]. Therefore, treatment of brain with THL gene therapy requires chronic repeat administration. However, TH replacement gene therapy of PD does not address the underlying problem in PD, which is degeneration of the nigral-striatal tract. What is needed for PD is neurotrophin gene therapy that reverses the degeneration of the nigral-striatal region of brain, and GDNF is a potent neurotrophin for this region of brain. A human prepro GDNF expression plasmid DNA under the influence of the 8 kb rat TH promoter was engineered [<xref rid="B1059-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1059</xref>], and encapsulated in OX26 TfRMAb-THLs and injected into PD rats at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after toxin administration at a dose of 10 &#956;g DNA/rat per injection [<xref rid="B1064-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1064</xref>]. The rats were then tested at 6 weeks after toxin administration, which was 3 weeks after the third and final dose of THLs, for apomorphine-induced rotation, for amphetamine-induced rotation, and for striatal TH enzyme activity. By 6 weeks after toxin administration, apomorphine-induced 360&#176; rotation was increased to 25 &#177; 2 RPM in the saline treated PD rats, but was reduced 87% to 3 &#177; 1 RPM in the THL treated rats. Amphetamine-induced 360&#176; rotation at 6 weeks after toxin injection was 11 &#177; 1 RPM in saline treated rats, and this was reduced 90% to 1.1 &#177; 0.2 RPM in the THL treated PD rats. The striatal TH enzyme activity was reduced 99% at 6 weeks after toxin injection in the saline treated rats, but was reduced only 23% at 6 weeks after toxin injection in the THL treated rats [<xref rid="B1064-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1064</xref>]. These results indicate a more durable therapeutic effect in experimental PD is achieved with GDNF gene therapy as compared to TH gene therapy. Placement of the GDNF transgene under the influence of the TH promoter restricts GDNF expression only to sites where the TH gene is transcriptionally active [<xref rid="B1059-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1059</xref>].</p><p><bold>THL brain delivery of a therapeutic gene for Niemann-Pick C1 disease.</bold> Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) disease is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, which encodes an intracellular membrane transporter of non-esterified cholesterol [<xref rid="B1065-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1065</xref>]. The NPC1 cholesterol transporter is a large protein with an open reading frame of 3.9 kb. Therefore, the NPC1 cDNA can only be inserted in a ssAAV and with a small promoter and 3&#8242;-UTR, so that the expression cassette is &lt;4.7 kb. It would be desirable to place the NPC1 gene under a neuron-specific promoter, such as the 1.5 kb human PDGF-B promoter [<xref rid="B1056-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1056</xref>]. However, such a construct would be too large to insert into an AAV vector. An 8 kb expression plasmid was engineered, designated pPDGFB-NPC1, which placed the 3.9 kb NPC1 open reading frame under the influence of the 1.5 kb PDGFB promoter and a bovine growth hormone poly A sequence [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>].

Owing to the severe neuropathology, NPC1 mice die young at about 10 weeks with reduced body weight [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. So as to encapsulate the pPDGFB-NPC1 plasmid in THLs active in the mouse, the recombinant 8D3 TfRMAb was expressed [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>], based on the previously reported amino acid sequence for the heavy and light chains of this antibody [<xref rid="B693-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">693</xref>]. THLs were produced from the recombinant 8D3 TfRMAb and encapsulated the pPDGFB-NPC1 plasmid DNA. Weekly intravenous THL treatment of NPC1 mice began at the age of 6&#8211;7 weeks. After euthanasia, the mass of the pPDGFB-NPC1 plasmid DNA was measured by qPCR in brain, liver, and spleen removed at 4 days following the last dose of THLs. The plasmid concentration in brain, liver, and spleen was 10.1 &#177; 3.1, 107 &#177; 9, and 40 &#177; 8 pg plasmid DNA per mg wet tissue [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. High plasmid DNA content in spleen is attributed to the high expression of the TfR1 in spleen in the mouse [<xref rid="B1068-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1068</xref>]. Based on the number of brain cells per mg wet brain, these qPCR studies indicate ~4 plasmid DNA molecules are delivered to each cell in brain [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. The expression of the NPC1 mRNA in brain, spleen, and liver, relative to the mRNA of glyceraldehyde 3&#8242;-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was measured by reverse transcriptase PCR [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. The &#916;Cq parameter is the difference in qPCR Cq value for NPC1 and GAPDH for brain, spleen, or liver. The &#916;&#916;Cq is the difference in &#916;Cq for the vehicle treated mouse and the THL treated mouse. The change in NPC1 mRNA abundance in the organs of the THL treated mouse was computed from the base 2 antilog of the &#916;&#916;Cq [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. The &#916;&#916;Cq values between THL and vehicle treatment groups showed the NPC1 mRNA, relative to the GAPDH mRNA, was increased 338-fold, 8192-fold, and 238-fold in brain, spleen, and liver, respectively [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>], which indicates THL treatment resulted in a significant increase in NPC1 transcript in brain in the NPC1 null mice. THL treatment caused a reduction in cholesterol inclusion bodies in brain, and peripheral organs, but did not increase lifespan in these mice [<xref rid="B706-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">706</xref>]. The lack of effect on lifespan was attributed to the delay in initiation of treatment until 6&#8211;7 weeks of age. By this time, the NPC1 mice already have developed pathologic changes in brain including autophagic lysosomal inclusion bodies, astrogliosis, microglia activation, and suppressed myelin production [<xref rid="B1069-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1069</xref>,<xref rid="B1070-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1070</xref>,<xref rid="B1071-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1071</xref>,<xref rid="B1072-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1072</xref>].

A dose of 20 &#956;g/kg of THL encapsulated DNA was administered by weekly IV injections for 6 consecutive weeks. A third group of rats were treated with weekly saline and served as a control. Delivery of the TH expression plasmid to brain was confirmed by Southern blot. There was no change in body weight, 14 serum chemistries or histology of brain and peripheral organs (liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney) following chronic THL administration. Immunohistochemistry of brain using primary antibodies against multiple markers of inflammation showed no inflammatory reaction in brain.</p><p><bold>THL manufacturing.</bold> THLs described above were produced at scale of 1&#8211;5 mL using sonication, extrusion, and purification by gel filtration chromatography [<xref rid="B1036-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1036</xref>]. These procedures are not scalable for commercial manufacturing. A scalable manufacturing process for pegylated liposomes, which can be adapted to THLs, uses an ethanol dilution method, which eliminates sonication, extrusion, and gel filtration [<xref rid="B1074-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1074</xref>]. This scalable manufacturing approach, as recently reviewed [<xref rid="B1037-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1037</xref>], adapts previously developed methods of liposome production by an ethanol injection method [<xref rid="B1075-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1075</xref>], and use of a T-shaped device for rapid mixing of lipids and aqueous plasmid DNA [<xref rid="B1076-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1076</xref>]. Ethanol dilution has two favorable effects on the encapsulation of plasmid DNA in pegylated liposomes. First, the ethanol dilution causes condensation of the plasmid DNA [<xref rid="B1077-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1077</xref>], which is necessary to enable encapsulation of the plasmid DNA within the 100&#8211;150 nm vesicles. The gyration radius of 10 kb supercoiled plasmid DNA is 460 nm [<xref rid="B1078-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1078</xref>], which greatly exceeds the radius of the small vesicles.

THL manufacturing at a 10 L level has been outlined using ethanol dilution and tangential flow filtration [<xref rid="B525-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">525</xref>]. A relatively small volume of THL manufacturing of 15 L could provide an amount sufficient to treat an orphan disease with 50% market penetration for a year at a weekly IV infusion dose of 10 &#956;g/kg of THL encapsulated plasmid DNA [<xref rid="B525-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">525</xref>]. The primary problem in the manufacturing of THLs is product formulation to ensure a shelf life of 1&#8211;2 years, and this is possible with THL lyophilization. Recent work shows that THLs fully conjugated with MAb and encapsulating plasmid DNA can be lyophilized, stored, and re-hydrated providing the proper lyoprotectant is used [<xref rid="B707-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">707</xref>].

The lyophilized, re-hydrated HIRMAb-THLs encapsulating a 5 kb plasmid DNA was injected intravenously in Rhesus monkeys at injection doses of 12 and 58 &#956;g/kg of THL encapsulated plasmid DNA. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of plasma clearance of the plasmid DNA was determined by qPCR [<xref rid="B707-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">707</xref>], and these PK parameters were comparable to those reported previously for HIRMAb plasma clearance in the primate [<xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

The PNPs were mixed with an expression plasmid encoding TNF related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is cytotoxic in tumors. The PLA-PEG, PLA-PEG-maleimide, and plasmid DNA were mixed and PNPs produced with an emulsion/solvent evaporation. The primary and secondary emulsions were produced by sonication [<xref rid="B1080-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1080</xref>]. There is concern about the integrity of the DNA using such a procedure, since sonication can nick super-coiled plasmid DNA [<xref rid="B1081-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1081</xref>,<xref rid="B1082-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1082</xref>], which would reduce or eliminate gene expression. The Trojan horse used in these THLs was cationized bovine serum albumin (cBSA) and the thiolated cBSA was conjugated to the PEG extended maleimide [<xref rid="B1080-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1080</xref>]. The Trojan horse PNPs were tested in vivo with a rat C6 intra-cranial glioma implanted in the striatum of BALB/c mice. Mice were treated at 7 days following implantation of the rat glioma cells, and were treated every 2&#8211;3 days for 2 weeks with a large dose, 100 &#956;g/kg, of PNP encapsulated plasmid DNA. This treatment extended the median survival from 20 days to 42 days [<xref rid="B1080-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1080</xref>]. In another study, OX26 TfRMAb THLs encapsulated a LacZ expression plasmid under the influence of either a cytomegalovirus or GFAP promoter, were injected intravenously in rats, and THL-mediated transgene expression in brain was confirmed [<xref rid="B1083-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1083</xref>]. THLs were prepared by double conjugation with the OX26 TfRMAb, for delivery of liposomes across the rat BBB, and with chlorotoxin (CTX), a 4 kDa peptide from scorpion venom, which binds glioma cells [<xref rid="B1084-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1084</xref>]. The plasmid DNA, pC27, encodes a 27 kDa carboxyl terminal peptide of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which suppresses glioma growth. For production of THLs, the lipids, which included a PEG-maleimide, and plasmid DNA were initially sonicated prior to liposome formation by extrusion. The thiolated OX26 and thiolated CTX were then conjugated at the maleimide group on the THLs. Since sonication can damage super-coiled DNA [<xref rid="B1081-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1081</xref>,<xref rid="B1082-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1082</xref>], it is not advisable to sonicate after addition of DNA to the preparation. When DNA is exposed to sonication, the retention of the super-coiled conformation of the plasmid DNA should be confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, which typically elutes as multiple bands [<xref rid="B707-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">707</xref>]. The therapeutic effects of the double conjugated THLs encapsulating the pC27 plasmid DNA were tested with a C6 intra-cranial glioma model in rats. The THLs conjugated only with the OX26 TfRMAb extended median survival of the tumor-bearing rats from 13 days to 29 days, and THLs double conjugated with the OX26 TfRMAb and CTX extended median survival of the rats to 46 days [<xref rid="B1084-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1084</xref>]. In another approach, THLs were conjugated with an antibody against the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R), and encapsulated a plasmid DNA encoding p11, a 10&#8211;12 kDa protein implicated in depression [<xref rid="B1085-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1085</xref>]. The results of these studies are difficult to interpret, since no information on the IGF2R MAb is provided. There are two types of IGF2R, and only one of these is expressed at the BBB. The IGF1R, which has high affinity for both IGF1 and IGF2, is expressed at the BBB, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.3</xref>.

Glutathione (GSH) has been conjugated to pegylated liposomes to trigger transport across the BBB by a putative GSH transporter at the brain endothelium (672).

The findings led to the conclusion that while receptor-mediated endocytosis of the TfRMAb-THLs was an active process at the brain capillary, the exocytosis of the THL from the capillary endothelium into brain ECS was limited, as compared to a much higher rate of exocytosis into the brain ECS at post-capillary venules [<xref rid="B1087-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1087</xref>]. The differential transport of THLs across the endothelium of the capillary vs. the post-capillary venule was said to be due to the lack of a peri-vascular space (PVS) at the capillary, and the presence of a PVS at the post-capillary venule [<xref rid="B1087-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1087</xref>]. The hypothesis of an absent capillary PVS is derived from the assumption that the brain capillary is &gt;90% invested by astrocyte foot processes. Electron microscopy of rat brain removed following aldehyde perfusion fixation shows an essentially complete ensheathment of the abluminal surface of the brain capillary by astrocyte foot processes [<xref rid="B1088-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1088</xref>]. Owing to this complete investment of the capillary by astrocyte foot processes, it is assumed there is a fusion of the capillary basement membrane and the separate basement membrane lining the glial limitans or astrocyte foot processes, thus eliminating any PVS at the brain capillary [<xref rid="B1089-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1089</xref>]. Conversely, at the post-capillary venule, it is said there is a separation of the capillary basement membrane and the glial limitans basement membrane, which creates a PVS at the post-capillary venule [<xref rid="B1089-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1089</xref>]. The problem with this theory of complete investment of the capillary by the astrocyte endfeet, thus obliterating a PVS at the capillary, is that the theory is based on an artifact derived from electron microscopy of chemically fixed brain. A different picture of the brain PVS and astrocyte endfeet emerges with cryo-fixation of brain, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f018" ref-type="fig">Figure 18</xref> and discussed below.</p><p>Electron microscopy of chemically fixed brain performed in the 1950s found a very small ECS in brain of only 3%, which did not comport with physiologic measurements of a brain ECS of ~25% of brain, as reviewed by Van Harreveld and colleagues in 1965 [<xref rid="B1090-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1090</xref>].

Free Drug in Plasma In Vivo and Role of Plasma Protein Binding</title><p>The major drug binding plasma proteins are albumin and &#945;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein (AAG), also called orosomucoid. AAG is a 42 kDa heavily glycosylated plasma protein and the 3D structure of human AAG has been determined [<xref rid="B1101-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1101</xref>]. AAG binds many drugs, and together with albumin, plays a major role in plasma protein binding of drugs [<xref rid="B1101-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1101</xref>]. AAG is an acute-phase reactant, and the plasma AAG concentration can vary over 7-fold depending on the clinical condition [<xref rid="B1102-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1102</xref>]. The concentration of AAG in plasma, about 0.1 g/dl, is 50-fold lower than the plasma albumin concentration [<xref rid="B1102-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1102</xref>]. However, the affinity of AAG for many drugs can be 100-fold higher than the affinity of the drug for albumin binding. Therefore, many CNS drugs are bound by both albumin and by AAG in plasma.</p><p>The number of drugs that are highly bound by plasma proteins, e.g., &gt;95% bound, is increasing. Before 2003, only about 30% of FDA-approved small molecules were classified as highly bound, but this number has increased to 45% of all drugs by 2019 [<xref rid="B1103-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1103</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to develop a model of how plasma protein binding impacts the brain uptake of small molecule CNS drugs. The free drug hypothesis posits that the fraction of drug in plasma that is bioavailable for transport across the BBB, i.e., pool L<sub>F</sub> in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref> and Equation (3), is the same fraction that is free in plasma in vitro, as determined by a variety of methods, one of which is equilibrium dialysis [<xref rid="B1104-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1104</xref>]. The free drug hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that the dissociation constant, KD, governing the binding of drug to the plasma protein that is measured in vitro, or KD<sup>in vitro</sup>, is identical to the KD of drug binding to the plasma protein at the brain endothelial interface in vivo, or KD<sup>in vivo</sup>. If the guiding principle is, &#8220;to measure is to know&#8221; [<xref rid="B1105-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1105</xref>], then this assumption of the free hormone hypothesis should be subjected to direct empiric testing in vivo. That is, the KD of the drug&#8211;plasma protein binding should be measured in vivo. If the drug&#8211;plasma protein KD<sup>in vivo</sup> is &gt;&gt; than the KD<sup>in vitro</sup>, then enhanced ligand dissociation from the plasma protein occurs in vivo within the brain capillary compartment, relative to the dissociation rates observed in vitro. Conversely, if the KD<sup>in vivo</sup> = KD<sup>in vitro</sup>, then the precepts of the free drug hypothesis are upheld with in vivo testing of the hypothesis.</p><p>Enhanced drug dissociation from plasma proteins such as albumin or AAG would be caused by conformational changes about the drug binding site on the plasma protein that takes place in vivo at the brain endothelial surface.

However, the concentration of total albumin or total AAG in the carotid artery injection solution is &gt;10-fold greater than the drug concentration.

The enhanced dissociation of drug or hormone from albumin and/or globulin binding sites in vivo within the brain capillary compartment increases the free drug in the brain capillary plasma compartment, L<sub>F</sub>, relative to the free drug measured in vitro, L<sub>F</sub>&#176; (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref>B). The fact that the KD<sup>in vivo</sup> is often many-fold higher than the KD<sup>in vitro</sup>, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, means the use of in vitro measurements of free drug in plasma, e.g., with equilibrium dialysis, may not provide an accurate representation of the drug&#8211;plasma protein binding interactions that take place in vivo at the brain endothelial surface.

However, many CNS drugs are lipophilic amines, which are sequestered within the acidic intracellular lysosomal compartment, which can have a pH of 4.5&#8211;5.5. This acidity will trap a drug with a high pKa, where pKa is the pH at which 50% of the drug is ionized.

The affinity of the CMT system is defined by the relationship between the absolute Km and the substrate concentration (S) in plasma.

If the plasma S &lt;&lt; Km, then the CMT system is low affinity, and Km<sup>app</sup> = Km, which indicates there are no competition effects in vivo. The transport of LNAAs across the BBB via LAT1 is the classic high affinity system, as the plasma concentrations of LNAAs approximate the absolute Km values for the individual LNAAs [<xref rid="B355-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">355</xref>]. The high affinity (low Km) of the BBB LAT1 system, and the approximation of LAT1 Km values by the concentrations of the individual LNAAs in plasma, is the physical basis of the selective vulnerability of the CNS to hyperaminoacidemias [<xref rid="B356-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">356</xref>]. The hyperphenylalaninemia of phenylketonuria (PKU) saturates the BBB LAT1 system with phenylalanine, and this saturation inhibits the brain uptake of other LNAAs, which are needed in brain to sustain cerebral protein synthesis. Conversely, LNAA transport in peripheral tissues is mediated by low affinity transporters with high Km values, and peripheral tissues are not exposed to LNAA starvation in the case of a hyperaminoacidemia such as PKU.

In the case of AMT or RMT of large molecules, it is important to separate endocytosis at the endothelium from transcytosis through the endothelial barrier, and this was performed with the capillary depletion method [<xref rid="B506-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">506</xref>]. At the end of the perfusion, the brain is homogenized in cold 13% 60 kDa dextran, followed by centrifugation at 4 &#176;C for 15 min at 5400&#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> in a swinging bucket rotor, and the post-vascular supernatant is carefully separated from the vascular pellet. Radioactivity is measured in each of the three fractions: total homogenate, post-vascular supernatant, and vascular pellet.

Therefore, test molecules that distributed to the post-vascular supernatant had undergone transcytosis through the BBB during the perfusion period.

Owing to this high affinity binding of acetylated LDL to the scavenger receptor, and also to the performance of the capillary depletion method at 4 &#176;C at all steps, the acetylated LDL stays retained in the vascular compartment despite the homogenization of brain. Since the description of the capillary depletion method in 1990 [<xref rid="B506-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">506</xref>], the method has been described in &gt;300 publications in PubMed. In several of these studies, the capillary depletion method has not been used as originated, because the method has been applied to ligands with low affinity binding to the putative receptor at the BBB. Such low affinity ligands have rapid dissociation rates, and will most likely dissociate from the brain vasculature and appear in the supernatant during the homogenization process. This ligand dissociation from the BBB receptor during the homogenization will produce an artifact of ligand distribution to the post-vascular supernatant, and this artifact will be ascribed to BBB transcytosis. The capillary depletion method was developed only for ligands that bind to the target receptor on the BBB with high affinity, such that there is no dissociation from the capillary receptor during the homogenization process.</p></sec><sec id="sec11dot4dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.4.4.

If the brain shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f021" ref-type="fig">Figure 21</xref> was homogenized and HRP enzyme activity was measured, one might conclude that HRP crosses the BBB, when, in fact, the HRP does not cross the BBB, but is confined to the plasma volume of brain.</p><p>It is necessary to determine <italic toggle="yes">both</italic> the VD<sup>test</sup> of the test molecule and the brain plasma volume (VD<sup>pv</sup>), which is explicitly included in Equation (7), as an experimental variable in the measurement of drug uptake by brain. The brain plasma volume is determined with either albumin or a non-specific IgG, neither of which cross the BBB. If the brain uptake of the test molecule is low, and VD<sup>test</sup> approximates VD<sup>pv</sup>, then (VD<sup>test</sup> &#8722; VD<sup>pv</sup>) = 0, and there is no BBB transport of the test molecule, as described in Equation (7). When there is no difference between VD<sup>test</sup> and VD<sup>pv</sup>, then the BBB PS<sup>influx</sup> = 0. In this setting, the test molecule is solely retained in brain within the plasma volume, as illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f021" ref-type="fig">Figure 21</xref>. The measurement of drug distribution in the brain plasma volume is particularly germane to the determination of the brain uptake of biologics following IV administration. As discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.4</xref> for therapeutic antibodies for brain, antibodies have been injected intravenously and antibody was detected in homogenates of brain. If the injection dose of the antibody was increased, then a higher amount of antibody was detected in brain homogenate, because the antibody in plasma is increased at the higher injection dose. However, if no correction for brain plasma volume is made, then the higher antibody concentration in brain homogenate at the higher injection dose will be erroneously interpreted as evidence that the therapeutic antibody crossed the BBB [<xref rid="B786-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">786</xref>].</p><p><bold>Artifacts caused by metabolism.</bold> The second confounding variable in the measurement of the PS<sup>influx</sup> using an IV injection technique is metabolism of the radiolabeled test molecule following uptake by peripheral tissues. The metabolic degradation of the [<sup>125</sup>I]-labeled test molecule leads to the release into the plasma of low molecular [<sup>125</sup>I]-metabolites that can cross the BBB. This brain uptake of metabolites produces radioactivity in brain that is not representative of the brain uptake of the test molecule. Instead, the brain uptake of the radioactivity is an artifact of metabolism of the test molecule. Such artifacts are exemplified in the case of the brain uptake of radioactivity following the IV injection of [<sup>125</sup>I]-EGF or [<sup>125</sup>I]-BDNF. The standard method of radio-iodination of a biologic is an oxidative reaction with 125-iodine and either chloramine T or Iodogen. This reaction places the <sup>125</sup>I radiolabel on the aromatic ring of tyrosine residues on the protein or peptide. Following uptake and metabolism of the [<sup>125</sup>I]-peptide by peripheral tissues, there is a gradual increase in the plasma concentration of TCA-soluble radiolabeled metabolites, such as [<sup>125</sup>I]-tyrosine [<xref rid="B1138-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1138</xref>]. The [<sup>125</sup>I]-tyrosine then enters the brain via CMT on BBB LAT1 to give an artifactual picture of brain uptake of the original radio-iodinated biologic, such as the [<sup>125</sup>I]-EGF (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>A,B).</p><p>Conversely, when the EGF is conjugated with DTPA and chelated with 111-indium, the amount of radioactivity that enters the brain is decreased &gt;10-fold (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>B). The [<sup>111</sup>In]-EGF is taken up and metabolized by peripheral tissues to the same extent as the [<sup>125</sup>I]-EGF, but the <sup>111</sup>In radioactivity is sequestered in the intracellular compartment of peripheral tissues and is not released to plasma [<xref rid="B1138-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1138</xref>]. In another example of brain uptake artifact caused by peripheral metabolism of chloramine T/Iodogen labeled peptides, TCA-soluble metabolites appear in plasma soon after the IV injection of [<sup>125</sup>I]-BDNF radio-iodinated with chloramine T, and this produces a high brain uptake of radioactivity (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>C). However, the peripheral degradation of [<sup>125</sup>I]-BDNF is progressively blocked by pegylation with either PEG<sup>2000</sup> or PEG<sup>5000</sup>, as demonstrated by comparison of the plasma AUC for [<sup>125</sup>I]-BDNF, [<sup>125</sup>I]-PEG<sup>2000</sup>-BDNF, and [<sup>125</sup>I]-PEG<sup>5000</sup>-BDNF shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>C. The pegylation of BDNF reduced the amount of TCA-soluble radiolabeled metabolites in plasma and reduced the brain uptake of radioactivity to the extent that the radioactivity was confined solely to the brain plasma volume following injection of [<sup>125</sup>I]-PEG<sup>5000</sup>-BDNF (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>C). The data in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f022" ref-type="fig">Figure 22</xref>B shows that the preferred form of radio-labeling of a biologic is chelation of 111-indium. Alternatively, biologics can be radio-iodinated with the [<sup>125</sup>I]-Bolton&#8211;Hunter reagent, which conjugates the radiolabeled reagent to surface lysine residues in a non-oxidative reaction. Lysine conjugated with the [<sup>125</sup>I]-Bolton&#8211;Hunter reagent that is released to plasma does not cross the BBB [<xref rid="B717-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">717</xref>].</p><p><bold>Plasma AUC.</bold> The third caveat in the quantitation of PS<sup>influx</sup> with IV injection methods is the need to determine the plasma AUC, pAUC, which is explicitly included in equation (7) as an experimental variable. The measurement of pAUC can be performed with standard pharmacokinetic methods when the experimental study period is long, e.g., &gt;30 min between IV injection and harvesting of brain, which is typically the case for biologics. If brain uptake is measured during short experimental time periods between IV injection and organ harvesting, which is the case for small molecules, then the plasma AUC can be measured with an external organ method. In this approach, a femoral artery is catheterized and blood is withdrawn with a syringe pump during the experimental period [<xref rid="B1140-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1140</xref>]. The plasma AUC (nmol&#183;min/mL) is the drug concentration in the syringe (nmol/mL) multiplied by the experimental time period (minutes).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec11dot5-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.5. Measurement of PS<sup>efflux</sup></title><p>The PS<sup>efflux</sup> is the product of K<sub>4&#183;</sub>VT, where K<sub>4</sub> is the rate constant of drug efflux from brain to blood across the BBB, as illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref> and Equation (2), and VT is the brain water space, 700 &#956;L/g [<xref rid="B1096-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1096</xref>]. The measurement of PS<sup>efflux</sup> is more challenging than the estimation of PS<sup>influx</sup>, because a number of variables contribute to the rate of efflux of test molecules across the BBB from brain to blood. These variables include brain metabolism of the test molecule, brain binding of the test molecule, or active uptake of the test molecule by brain cells. Both the Brain Uptake Index (BUI) and Brain Efflux Index (BEI) methods can be used to measure the rate constant (K<sub>4</sub>, <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref>) of test molecule efflux across the BBB.</p><sec id="sec11dot5dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.5.1.

To use the BUI method to measure efflux, the time between carotid arterial injection and decapitation is prolonged from the usual 0.25 min to 1, 2, and 4 min. The brain is pulsed with solute within 5 s of the arterial injection, and efflux from brain to blood may then be monitored over the time period up to 4 min. Beyond 4 min, there is a loss of linearity of the efflux from brain owing to recirculation [<xref rid="B1141-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1141</xref>]. Any metabolism of the test molecule during the 4 min will prevent reliable estimates of efflux, so studies are generally restricted to solutes not metabolized within 4 min of administration. Both the influx and the efflux of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 3-O-methyl D-glucose (3OMG), were measured with the BUI technique [<xref rid="B340-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>].

The kinetic analysis of 3OMG efflux from brain was based on the earlier theoretical analyses of solute efflux from skeletal muscle [<xref rid="B1143-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1143</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec11dot5dot2-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.5.2. Brain Efflux Index Method</title><p>The Brain Efflux Index (BEI) method has advantages over the BUI method for the study of solute efflux from brain to blood. First, efflux of solute that has a low rate of influx from blood to brain can be measured with the BEI method. The study of efflux with the BUI method requires a significant influx of the test solute into brain from blood so that efflux from brain can be measured. In the BEI method, the radiolabeled test solute is injected directly into brain under stereotaxic guidance [<xref rid="B450-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">450</xref>]. The second advantage of the BEI method is that the effects of cross-competition between substrates or drugs and the radiolabeled test solute can be measured, as reviewed in <xref rid="sec6dot3dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 6.3.1</xref>. Solute or drug efflux from brain is typically measured over time periods of 20&#8211;60 min with the BEI method. Under these conditions, it is important to confirm there is no metabolism of the test solute during the experimental period. If the test molecule was metabolized in brain, then efflux of the radiolabeled metabolite would produce an artifact, and lead to erroneous conclusions about solute efflux from brain. The classic example of artifacts of solute efflux caused by brain metabolism is the case of the Abeta amyloid peptide, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot1dot5-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.1.5</xref>. In the original study [<xref rid="B1144-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1144</xref>], [<sup>125</sup>I]-A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40/42</sup> was injected into brain, and efflux of radioactivity from brain to blood was observed, and ascribed to LRP1-mediated efflux of the A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> peptide from brain to blood. This model had important implications for the understanding of the formation of A&#946; amyloid plaques in AD, and the extent to which receptor-mediated efflux of A&#946; peptides from brain to blood had on this process. However, the efflux of radioactivity from brain was shown to be an artifact caused by rapid degradation of [<sup>125</sup>I]-A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40/42</sup> in brain following intra-cerebral injection of the amyloid peptide [<xref rid="B607-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">607</xref>]. The suppression of degradation of [<sup>125</sup>I]-A&#946;<sup>1&#8211;40</sup> in brain eliminates the efflux of radioactivity [<xref rid="B607-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">607</xref>], which indicates the A&#946; amyloid peptide of AD does not efflux from brain across the BBB.</p><p>In addition to metabolism, interpretation of BEI data is also confounded by brain tissue binding/sequestration of the ligand. The rate constant of efflux (K<sub>eff</sub>) of estrone, a highly lipid-soluble sex steroid that freely crosses the BBB [<xref rid="B322-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>], is only 0.069 min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> as measured with the BEI method [<xref rid="B457-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">457</xref>].

The K<sub>eff</sub> measured with the BEI method is much less than the K<sub>4</sub> of estrone efflux from brain to blood across the BBB, owing to sequestration by brain tissue binding proteins of sex steroids such as estrone. A mathematical model, similar to that developed for analysis of efflux across the BBB and brain tissue binding in vivo, for either steroid hormones [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>] or drugs [<xref rid="B1145-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1145</xref>], must be developed to discern how both efflux across the BBB and brain tissue binding/sequestration influences the K<sub>eff</sub> determined with the BEI method.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec11dot6-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.6.

The differential equations and analytic solutions of the mathematical model used to derive from BUI data the K<sub>5</sub> and K<sub>6</sub> parameters of propranolol binding in brain in vivo have been reported previously [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>,<xref rid="B1145-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1145</xref>]. The increase in the BUI with time after carotid arterial injection shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f023" ref-type="fig">Figure 23</xref> is due to (a) binding/sequestration of [<sup>3</sup>H]-propranolol by brain, and (b) the rapid efflux from brain of the freely diffusible [<sup>14</sup>C]-butanol reference, which is not sequestered by brain. Similar to propranolol, sex steroid hormones are also avidly sequestered by brain [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>]. Unlike the sex steroid hormones, the corticosteroid, corticosterone, is not sequestered in brain in vivo [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>]. The selective sequestration of sex steroids, but not corticosteroids, by brain in vivo explains the high brain VD, i.e., high BB ratios, of the sex steroids relative to a much lower BB ratio for the corticosteroids [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>]. Developmental regulation of brain sequestration of sex steroid hormones is observed, as no brain tissue binding is found in newborn rabbits [<xref rid="B458-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">458</xref>]. The selectivity of the brain binding of sex steroid hormones, but not corticosteroids, and the developmental regulation of this process for steroid hormones, suggests that specific binding proteins are responsible for the sequestration in brain of hormones and drugs. However, mechanisms other than tissue binding may account for a high BB or BP ratio, particularly for lipophilic amine drugs such as propranolol or lidocaine, which may exist in protonated forms. The effect of plasma pH on BBB transport of propranolol or lidocaine in vivo was investigated with the BUI method [<xref rid="B1145-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1145</xref>]. Influx of either drug across the BBB in vivo was inhibited 40&#8211;50% when the pH of the injection solution was lowered from 7.5 to 5.5. The lower transport of the protonated form of the drug was attributed to preferential transport of the unprotonated drug across the BBB in vivo. Similarly, CNS drugs with a high pKa may be protonated in the acidic compartment of the lysosome, which would contribute to the sequestration of the drug by brain, as demonstrated with the brain slice preparation [<xref rid="B1131-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1131</xref>] discussed in <xref rid="sec11dot3dot3-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 11.3.3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec11dot7-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.7.

However, in vivo/in vitro BBB permeability comparisons showed the in vitro BBB model was leaky and over-estimated BBB permeability for small molecules that crossed the BBB by free diffusion, and under-estimated BBB permeability for small molecules that crossed the BBB by CMT [<xref rid="B1174-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1174</xref>]. No specific CMT transport of L-DOPA across the in vitro BBB could be measured [<xref rid="B1174-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1174</xref>], which was due to the marked down-regulation of LAT1 gene expression when brain endothelial cells are grown in cell culture. Detection of the LAT1 transcript by Northern blot using 2 &#956;g polyA + RNA purified from either isolated brain capillaries or cultured brain endothelial cells required development of the film autoradiogram for 2 h vs. 7 days, respectively [<xref rid="B358-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">358</xref>,<xref rid="B1175-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1175</xref>], which indicates LAT1 gene expression is down-regulated ~100-fold when brain endothelial cells are grown in culture. A similar level of down-regulation of GLUT1 gene expression was observed when brain endothelial cells were grown in cell culture [<xref rid="B1156-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1156</xref>]. Early studies showed down-regulation of a BBB-specific enzyme, &#947;GTP, in cell culture, and the partial up-regulation of &#947;GTP expression by co-culture of endothelial cells with astrocytes [<xref rid="B1176-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1176</xref>]. In 1990, the transwell model was developed, where primary cultures of bovine brain endothelial cells were grown on one side of a transwell, and primary cultures of newborn rat brain astrocytes were grown on the other side of Millicell-CM filter with a pore size of 0.4 microns [<xref rid="B1177-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1177</xref>]. The transwell model lacks the shear stress caused by capillary blood flow. The shear stress on brain endothelial cells in vivo is 5&#8211;20 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B1178-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1178</xref>]. This flow-related shear stress was produced with an in vitro BBB model by co-culture of bovine aortic endothelial cells and rat C6 glioma cells in a hollow fiber cartridge; fluid flow through the cartridge at 4 mL/min produced a shear stress of 4 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B1179-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1179</xref>]. This dynamic in vitro BBB model was a precursor to a microfluidic &#8216;BBB on a chip&#8217; models where a silicone chip was fabricated to allow for fluid flow through an outer endothelial chamber with astrocytes cultured in an inner chamber [<xref rid="B1180-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1180</xref>]. The BBB-on-a-chip model was first described in 2005, although this model had no fluid flow component [<xref rid="B1181-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1181</xref>]. It is not clear that in vitro BBB models require continuous flow of culture medium. The hypothesis that fluid flow induces BBB properties in brain endothelial cells is at odds with the lack of barrier properties in endothelia of non-brain organs, which are also exposed to flow induced shear stress [<xref rid="B569-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">569</xref>].

Retinoic acid increases tight junctions via the Wnt signaling pathway [<xref rid="B1184-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1184</xref>], which plays a special role in the differentiation of brain endothelium [<xref rid="B1185-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1185</xref>].

However, the central issue is the extent to which even modern in vitro BBB models replicate the properties of the BBB in vivo.

The cause of the down-regulation of BBB specific gene expression in cell culture is not known, but may be related to the breakdown of the neuro-vascular unit in cell culture.

Given this close proximity of endothelial cells, astrocyte foot processes, and pericytes, which share the same basement membrane with the endothelium, it may be that current co-culture models do not replicate the proximity between these cells that exist in vivo.</p><p><bold>Cellular proximity with the in vitro BBB model.</bold> Early work showed that the induction of BBB properties in cultured endothelium was observed only in mixed cultures, not co-cultures of endothelium and astrocytes [<xref rid="B1195-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1195</xref>].

Similarly, if the channel size is only 0.4 microns in a BBB-on-a-chip model, there is no spread of astrocyte processes into the endothelial chamber [<xref rid="B1181-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1181</xref>]. The larger pore size of 3 microns enabled astrocyte cellular processes to extend through the pore to come in contact with the endothelium [<xref rid="B1196-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1196</xref>].

However, these models have not been fully validated with in vivo/in vitro comparisons of solute and drug permeability via either lipid-mediated free diffusion, carrier-mediated transport, or receptor-mediated transport. Therefore, in vitro models should not be used as a primary method of determining drug transport across the BBB. In vitro models need to be validated and confirmed with in vivo measurements of BBB permeability. It may be that the real value of in vitro BBB models is not for the screening of drug transport across the BBB, but rather as a model that elucidates the mechanisms responsible for the induction of tissue-specific gene expression at the brain capillary endothelium, and the neuro-vascular unit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec11dot8-pharmaceutics-14-01283"><title>11.8. BBB Transport Methods from Perspective of Pharmaceutical Industry</title><p>The methods reviewed above for the determination of the PS product of drug transport across the BBB in vivo, in either the blood-to-brain or brain-to-blood direction, are not widely employed within the pharmaceutical industry. Instead, industry seeks a unified parameter of drug distribution into brain, such as the CSF concentration, for biologics, or the log BB for small molecules. The &#8216;BB&#8217; parameter, which is the ratio of total drug in brain divided by the total drug in blood (or plasma), has given way to the K<sub>p,uu</sub> [<xref rid="B1200-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1200</xref>], which is the ratio of <italic toggle="yes">free</italic> drug in brain divided by the <italic toggle="yes">free</italic> drug in blood (or plasma), as defined in Equation (3). Underlying the use of the K<sub>p,uu</sub> is the likely supposition that the concentration of drug in brain that drives receptor occupancy is the free drug in brain, not the tissue-bound drug in brain. The problem with the interpretation of data on the K<sub>p,uu</sub> parameter relates to how the &#8216;free drug in plasma&#8217;, and the &#8216;free drug in brain&#8217;, are experimentally determined. The &#8216;free drug&#8217; methods advocated by industry allow for the measurement of the free drug in plasma and brain with in vitro methods, such as equilibrium dialysis of an aliquot of plasma in parallel with an aliquot of brain homogenate [<xref rid="B1200-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1200</xref>].</p><p><bold>Free drug in plasma.</bold> The measurement of free drug in plasma in vitro with equilibrium dialysis assumes the KD governing the binding of the drug to the plasma protein in vitro in a test tube is the same as the KD of binding of the drug to the plasma protein in vivo at the glycocalyx surface of the brain capillary endothelium. If this assumption is never subjected to direct empiric testing in vivo, then there is no adherence to the principle of &#8220;to measure is to know&#8221; [<xref rid="B1105-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">1105</xref>].

In this case, the measurement of free drug in vitro with equilibrium dialysis significantly underestimates the fraction of drug in plasma that is bioavailable for transport into brain. The lack of a reliable measure of the bioavailable drug in plasma, or L<sub>F</sub>, impacts on estimates of the free drug in brain in vivo, or L<sub>M</sub>, as the latter is directly related to the former, as shown by Equation (3). The measurement of free drug in plasma in vitro with a method such as equilibrium dialysis is a useful screen of the extent to which a given drug is plasma protein bound. However, if the bioavailable drug in brain in vivo is not measured, and in vitro free drug is extrapolated to the in vivo condition, then only confirmation bias is supporting the free drug hypothesis.</p><p><bold>Free drug in brain.</bold> The measurement of free drug in brain in vitro with equilibrium dialysis of a homogenate of brain is useful in predicting the brain volume of distribution, or total drug BB ratio. However, the use of in vitro equilibrium dialysis of brain homogenate does not yield reliable estimates of the free drug in brain in vivo, because this in vitro homogenate approach measures free drug in brain in the absence of the continuous flow in vivo of bioavailable drug in plasma. The in vivo bioavailable drug in plasma, the L<sub>F</sub> parameter in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f019" ref-type="fig">Figure 19</xref>, acts as a forcing function controlling the free drug in brain (L<sub>M</sub>), along with PS<sup>influx</sup> and PS<sup>efflux</sup>, as described in Equation (3).

The absence of drug transport across the BBB is the singular reason that CNS drug development is so difficult. Yet, CNS drug developers practice their craft by adhering to two conflicting beliefs: (a) drugs for CNS disease can be developed, and (b) CNS drug development can take place in the absence of any consideration of the blood&#8211;brain barrier.

Recombinant TPP1 (cerliponase alfa) was approved for treatment of the brain in CLN2 disease, an inherited lysosomal storage disorder, and the enzyme was infused into one lateral ventricle bimonthly via an Ommaya reservoir [<xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The control group in the pivotal clinical trial was historical controls, perhaps from a natural reluctance to subject young patients to a chronically implanted Ommaya reservoir for the purpose of placebo infusion. However, as emphasized over 40 years ago by Aird [<xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], the proper control group for an ICV drug trial is IV administration of the study drug. This is because drug injected into the CSF is rapidly exported to blood as noted by Fishman and Christy over 50 years ago [<xref rid="B83-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Therefore, the study drug may exert therapeutic effects owing to drug action in peripheral organs, which are falsely attributed to a drug effect on the CNS, as discussed in <xref rid="sec2dot1dot4-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1.4</xref>.</p><p>In all of the clinical trials outlined in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f025" ref-type="fig">Figure 25</xref>, and discussed thus far, the CNS drug development program either was silent on the issue of BBB delivery, or employed a BBB avoidance strategy. The first drug to be re-engineered with a BBB drug delivery technology and receive market approval following a phase 3 clinical trial is the IgG-iduronate 2-sulfatase fusion protein, pabinafusp alfa (IZCARGO<sup>&#174;&#174;</sup>) [<xref rid="B720-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="bibr">720</xref>], which received MHLW approval in Japan in 2021 for treatment of the brain with MPSII (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-01283-f025" ref-type="fig">Figure 25</xref>). The IgG domain of this fusion protein is a TfRMAb, which enables RMT of the IgG-lysosomal enzyme fusion protein across the BBB in vivo, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis into brain cells, as discussed in <xref rid="sec8dot3dot1-pharmaceutics-14-01283" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3.1</xref>. This model of re-engineering biologics with BBB Trojan horse antibodies for RMT across the BBB can be replicated for all classes of biologics, including enzymes, neurotrophins, decoy receptors, and therapeutic antibodies. However, the CNS drug developer must first engineer a BBB drug delivery technology.</p><p>The re-engineering of the biologic for BBB delivery must take place in the earliest phases of preclinical drug development, and well before entry into clinical trials for brain disease. Should the CNS drug developer choose to go forward with a drug for brain that is not a lipid-soluble small molecule, and without BBB drug delivery technology, then the clinical trial failures of the past 25 years will only be replicated. Such a decision would be reminiscent of the choice of Fitzgerald&#8217;s Gatsby, &#8220;so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past&#8221;.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Institutional Review Board Statement</title><p>Not applicable.</p></notes><notes><title>Informed Consent Statement</title><p>Not applicable.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>Data sharing not applicable.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>W.M.P. is an inventor of patents on the delivery of biologics to brain.</p></notes><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA, amino acid;

(<bold>C</bold>) The brain/plasma ratio of radioactivity is equal to the brain volume of distribution (VD), and this is plotted against the plasma AUC for 3 forms of radio-iodinated BDNF: [<sup>125</sup>I]-BDNF, [<sup>125</sup>I]-PEG<sup>2000</sup>-BDNF, and [<sup>125</sup>I]-PEG<sup>5000</sup>-BDNF. The progressive pegylation of BDNF with PEG<sup>2000</sup> and then PEG<sup>5000</sup> blocks the peripheral metabolism of BDNF, as reflected in the increasing plasma AUC. As the BDNF metabolism is progressively inhibited, the brain VD of BDNF decreases. The Vo, 13 &#177; 1 &#956;L/g, shown by the horizontal bar is the brain plasma volume measured with [<sup>14</sup>C]-rat albumin. The brain VD of BDNF following pegylation with PEG<sup>5000</sup> completely suppresses peripheral metabolism of the BDNF and the brain VD = Vo, which shows that BDNF does not cross the BBB.
