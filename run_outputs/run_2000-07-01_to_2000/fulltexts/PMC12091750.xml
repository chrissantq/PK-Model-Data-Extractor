The current Japanese guidelines (2019 edition) for managing and treating MRSA infections mention alternative anti-MRSA agents, including sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) and rifampicin (RFP). Both ST and RFP are oral drugs and are expected to be effective alternatives to anti-MRSA drugs in clinical cases where anti-MRSA drugs are not indicated. Although guidelines for treating MRSA infections describe the efficacy of ST-RFP combination therapy and although it is used in clinical practice, only a limited number of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated its efficacy in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of ST-RFP against MRSA in some <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models, including a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. The MRSA strains obtained were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility tests. A checkerboard assay for drug combination synergy of ST-RFP was performed. Furthermore, a chemostat model was used to validate the combination therapy of ST-RFP as an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. Viable cell counts and antibiotic concentrations were measured. The checkerboard assay showed that the ST-RFP combination had an additive effect on all strains (the lowest fractional inhibitory concentration index ranged from 0.63 to 1.00). The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> chemostat model demonstrated the usefulness of the combination of ST-RFP against MRSA, especially in ST-resistant strains. Regrowth of MRSA was observed in RFP monotherapy but not in the ST-RFP combination therapy. This study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the ST-RFP combination against ST-resistant MRSA, providing important foundational data that may support future clinical investigations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Kitasato University School of Allied Health Sciences </institution></funding-source><award-id>2021-1046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1859-2342</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from the Kitasato University School of Allied Health Sciences (Grant-in-Aid for Research Project, No. 2021-1046) to M.N.

In Japan, six anti-MRSA agents have been approved for MRSA-associated infections, namely vancomycin (VCM), teicoplanin (TEIC), arbekacin (ABK), linezolid (LZD), daptomycin (DAP), and tedizolid (TZD) [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In case of difficulty or treatment failure when using any anti-MRSA agent as monotherapy, combination therapy is often considered. Some clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of combination therapies, including VCM plus &#946;-lactams or DAP plus &#946;-lactams [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Practical guidelines for the management and treatment of infections caused by MRSA (2019 Edition) [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] mention alternative anti-MRSA agents containing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), rifampicin (RFP), minocycline (MINO), and clindamycin (CLDM). RFP monotherapy usually leads to the development of antibiotic resistance; therefore, combination therapy is recommended when using RFP. The Japanese guidelines for the treatment of MRSA infections mention the use of combination therapy with ST and RFP to prevent antibiotic resistance. In addition, European guidelines for pediatric osteoarticular infections also describe ST plus RFP treatment for <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the 2011 guidelines for the treatment of MRSA infections issued by the IDSA in the United States, ST&#8201;+&#8201;RFP is listed as an oral treatment option for osteoarticular infections [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, in the 2021 MRSA treatment guidelines in the United Kingdom, the combination of RFP with ST was once recommended for osteoarticular infections involving biofilms; however, the guidelines only state that there is no clear evidence for this [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, some reports have described the efficacy of ST plus RFP combination therapy. Unlike VCM and DAP, which are administered intravenously, ST and RFP are administered orally. Oral treatment with ST plus RFP has been administered to asymptomatic carriers of MRSA [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. David et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Daniela et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that ST plus RFP combination therapy is, to some extent, effective in clearing MRSA in patients with cystic fibrosis. Anna-Karin et al. reported that the combination of ST and RFP was more effective in eliminating pharyngeal MRSA carriage than topical treatment with mupirocin alone [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There is no consensus on the efficacy of ST and RFP combination therapy for the treatment of invasive MRSA infections, such as infective endocarditis or bacteremia. There are a few reports of MRSA infective endocarditis with lung abscesses treated with VCM plus ST and RFP [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The adjunctive rifampicin for <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteremia (ARREST) study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, assessed the efficacy of adjunctive RFP [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The ARREST study revealed no added advantages of adjunctive RFP; however, various anti-MRSA agents were included in the study backbone antibiotic therapies apart from ST. Hence, the efficacy of ST plus RFP combination therapy alone against MRSA bacteremia remains unclear. Therefore, basic studies on ST plus RFP combinations, such as checkerboard assays or <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> pharmacodynamic models, are valuable for supporting the optimum clinical use of this therapy.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> pharmacodynamic models can simulate <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> human pharmacokinetic profiles and more accurately assess the efficacy of antibiotics, including the emergence of drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

However, only a few reports have focused on basic laboratory research on this treatment modality, and its effectiveness remains controversial [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This study investigated the combined effects of ST and RFP on MRSA strains, including ST-R strains. The checkerboard assay revealed the additive effect of ST and RFP against all strains, and the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> pharmacodynamic model showed the effectiveness of the ST plus RFP combination therapy, particularly against ST-R and ST-LS MRSA.</p><p>Regarding the <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains used in the checkerboard assay, the MICs of ST and RFP in combination were lower than those of monotherapies against all strains. In particular, ST-R strains could not be inhibited by ST alone, whereas the combination of ST and RFP inhibited the growth of ST-R strains. Therefore, we inferred that the ST plus RFP combination therapy might be effective against ST-R MRSA strains. Although a previous study reported that LVX&#8201;+&#8201;RFP was superior to ST&#8201;+&#8201;RFP <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this study evaluated the effect of ST&#8201;+&#8201;RFP on biofilms, which is different from our study. The additive effect of ST and RFP shown in this study is a new finding regarding the combination therapy with ST and RFP <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p><p>A report by the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) revealed the frequency of resistance to anti-MRSA agents, and 0.6% of the MRSA strains were ST-R strains in 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The pharmacodynamic model in this study showed the usefulness of the combination therapy of ST plus RFP against MRSA, especially the ST-R strains. The Japanese guidelines for treating MRSA infections state that the most effective setpoints of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic profiles are unclear for ST or RFP [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The parameters of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles in this study were the usual dosages of oral ST and RFP in healthy individuals. Therefore, this <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> study suggests that ST-R MRSA strains may respond to the ST plus RFP combination at standard concentrations, indicating its potential utility for future clinical evaluation.</p><p>In this study, RFP monotherapy was effective in the early stages; however, bacterial regrowth occurred after 12&#8201;h of treatment. Typically, monotherapy with RFP is not recommended because it induces drug resistance. In this study, we confirmed that the MIC value of RFP clearly increased in the strains after monotherapy with RFP. The addition of ST to RFP inhibited the regrowth of all strains. A previous report showed that the combination of RFP and TMP effectively prevented the development of RFP resistance in a murine <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> infection model [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, a review of clinical studies reported that oral RFP is an effective agent for preventing RFP resistance when combined with ST or MINO [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> pharmacodynamic model used in this study showed a preventive effect against RFP resistance, which is consistent with the results of previous reports. For the KAM636 and KAM1160 strains, ST monotherapy was somewhat effective, indicating that ST had a lower MIC against the KAM636 and KAM1160 strains than against the KAM444 strain (<xref rid="pone.0323935.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Combination therapy with ST and RFP is becoming increasingly imperative for MRSA infections. Antibiotic exposure induces persistent intracellular <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> infection, contributing to therapeutic failure [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, ST plus RFP combination therapy was more effective at exterminating intracellular MRSA than VCM monotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In Japan, LZD and TZD are the only anti-MRSA agents used in oral medicine. Even when there is no indication of MRSA infection, ST and RFP are considered alternative anti-MRSA agents. An early switch from intravenous to oral antimicrobials has various benefits, including reducing the risk of catheter-related infections and the cost of antimicrobial therapy without compromising clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Some reports regarding clinical trials of ST plus RFP versus LZD alone for treating MRSA infection showed that ST-RFP combination therapy is not inferior to LZD monotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, ST plus RFP combination therapy is more cost-effective than LZD in treating MRSA infections [<xref rid="pone.0323935.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>This study had some limitations. The results of the experiments in this study were evaluated for only up to 24&#8201;h, and only two reference and three clinically isolated strains were assessed in this study. Therefore, the time taken for the ST-RFP combination therapy to inhibit the development of resistant strains is unclear. More strains and longer chemostat model experiments are required. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic model in this study represents the antibiotic concentration curve for blood, not the tissues. Thus, the results could be extrapolated to sepsis or bacteremia but not to other infectious diseases. The advantage of ST-RFP combination therapy was observed in ST-R and ST-LS MRSA isolates but not in the reference MRSA strain. Moreover, RFP-R and ST-RFP double-resistant isolates were not evaluated in this study. Therefore, cases that need ST-RFP combination therapy may not be so common. However, we would like to emphasize that this study was based solely on <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments and was not intended to directly suggest changes to the current clinical treatment strategies. Nonetheless, our findings suggest potential clinical applicability in specific scenarios, such as when the causative organism cannot be isolated or its MIC to ST is unknown, and oral therapy is preferred. In such cases, ST-RFP combination therapy may serve as a viable treatment option, although further clinical validation is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of ST plus RFP combination against MRSA using a checkerboard assay analysis and an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> pharmacodynamic model.

</p><p>Additional Editor Comments :</p><p>Dear Authors,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript for consideration. We have now received comments from three reviewers, and based on their feedback, we invite you to submit a major revision of your work.</p><p>The reviewers found your study on the efficacy of a combination of SXT and RIF against MRSA to be interesting and potentially valuable. However, they have raised several important points that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication.</p><p>Major Points for Revision:</p><p>1. Sample Size and Strain Selection: Expand your study to include a larger sample size, encompassing both clinical and reference strains. This will strengthen the validity of your findings.</p><p>2. Literature Review: Re-evaluate your claim regarding the lack of in vitro studies for the TMP/SMX+rifampin combination in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. A reviewer has pointed out at least one relevant study (El Haj et al., 2018) that you should acknowledge and discuss.</p><p>3. Guidelines: Broaden your discussion of guidelines to include international perspectives, not just those from Japan. This will increase the relevance of your work for a global audience.</p><p>4. Strain Characterization: Clarify the discrepancies in MIC values for your clinical strains, particularly regarding the strain with an intermediate MIC to TMP/SMX. Discuss the implications of these differences on your results and conclusions.</p><p>5. Resistance Development: Address whether you checked for the development of rifampin resistance in your experiments, particularly for the KAM444 strain that regained growth.</p><p>6. Clinical Relevance: Provide a more nuanced discussion of the clinical applicability of your findings, particularly regarding the use of this combination therapy for TMP/SMX-resistant strains and in cases of sepsis or bacteremia</p><p>Minor Points:</p><p>1. Improve the quality of Figure 1, which was reported as blurry.</p><p>2. Address the specific language and formatting suggestions made by the reviewers, including:</p><p>a. Removing the word 'therapy' where inappropriate</p><p>b. Correcting alignment issues in Table 2</p><p>c. Reconsidering certain assertive statements</p><p>d. Using passive forms where appropriate</p><p>e. Properly referencing laboratory products</p><p>Additional Suggestions:</p><p>1. Explain why only two replicates were conducted instead of three.</p><p>2. Consider removing or revising the sentence about a previous report (lines 260-261) as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p><p>3. Add the web address mentioned on line 267 to your reference list.</p><p>Please provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers' comments along with your revised manuscript.

I have few recommendations about the manuscript:</p><p>Line 44 and 312: Remove the word &#8216;therapy&#8217; because this is not a clinical study.</p><p>Line 47: Write &#8216;against&#8217; instead of &#8216;therapy of&#8217;.</p><p>Table 2: Some alignment problems exist in some columns of Table 2.

In the cited report, although rifampicin and minocycline considerably decreased both WT and SCVs, both bacterial counts recovered to an initial number 48 hours later.</p><p>Line 267: A number can be given for the web adress and this reference can be added to references list.</p><p>Line 273-274: This sentence is a bit assertive. This was an in vitro study and the number of strains tested in this study were low. You can use a more approprite sentence or you should support this sentence with information obtained from clinical studies.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The article by Masaki Nakamura et al. presents the findings of an in vitro study investigating the efficacy of a combination of SXT and RIF against MRSA.</p><p>The article presents some intriguing findings, yet it is imperative to substantiate these outcomes with a more extensive sample size, encompassing both clinical and reference strains.</p><p>In the event of a resubmission, other factors will have to be taken into consideration.</p><p>It is preferable to utilise passive forms.</p><p>Please clarify why only two replicates were conducted, rather than three.</p><p>The sources of the laboratory products in question are not adequately referenced.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;I carefully read the interesting manuscript describing the in vitro activity of TMP/SMX and rifampin combination for MRSA in 4 bacterial strains. There are limited therapeutic options for MRSA and sometimes even susceptible strains may persist antibiotic therapy. Therefore, combination therapy is often used. The methods are sound and overall, the manuscript is well written. There are, however, some issues to address.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The authors claim there is no in vitro studies for the TMP/SMX+rifampin combination in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. That is not accurate. El Haj et al showed enhanced anti-biofilm capacity but raised concerns that rifampin resistance emerges. Combination of linezolid and rifampin protected against resistance (Cristina El Haj, Oscar Murillo, Alba Ribera, Nuria Lloberas, Joan G&#243;mez-Junyent, Fe Tubau, Pere Fontova, Carme Cabellos, Javier Ariza, Evaluation of linezolid or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in combination with rifampicin as alternative oral treatments based on an in vitro pharmacodynamic model of staphylococcal biofilm, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Volume 51, Issue 6, 2018, Pages 854-861, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.01.014" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.01.014</ext-link>).</p><p>2. The authors refer to guidelines from Japan. It would be helpful for the broader readership to refer to other local and international guidelines. These are a few examples:</p><p>Catherine Liu, Arnold Bayer, Sara E. Cosgrove, Robert S. Daum, Scott K. Fridkin, Rachel J. Gorwitz, Sheldon L. Kaplan, Adolf W. Karchmer, Donald P. Levine, Barbara E.

The authors investigated two reference ATCC strains susceptible to both TMP/SMX and rifampin and two clinical strains resistance to TMP/SMX and susceptible to rifampin. These two clinical strains, however, differed in their MICs to TMP/SMX which were 3 and &gt;32. The EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints for TMP/SMX are &gt;4 for resistance and 2&gt; for susceptible. Thus, one of the clinical strains tested was actually non-susceptible with intermediate MIC and the other resistant. Using the checkerboard method this intermediate strain was resistant with MIC &gt;8 and reduced to 2 when rifampin was added. Can the authors comment son these differences?</p><p>4. The lowest fractional inhibitory concentration index for combination therapy was 0.5-1 indicating an additive value and chemostat-based kill curves showed increased efficacy of combination therapy in the resistant strains. This was not evident for the susceptible reference strains. Still, the fully resistant strain (KAM444) regained growth (but at a slower rate). Did the authors check for development of resistance for rifampin in this experiment?</p><p>5. As the authors note, TMP/SMX resistant strains are rare and TMP/SMX alone is often used as empiric therapy when MRSA is suspected. As a clinician, I wouldn&#8217;t know why I should use TMP/SMX in combination when the isolate is actually resistant to TMP/SMX. I would definitely not think of using this combination for sepsis or bacteremia as the authors suggest.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. Figure 1 is blurry</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>We sincerely thank the Editor and reviewers for their thorough evaluation of our manuscript and constructive feedback. We have revised the manuscript accordingly. Below we provide a point-by-point response to each comment. The reviewer&#8217;s comments are quoted, and our responses follow each comment.</p><p>Response to Editor</p><p>Major Point 1: Sample Size and Strain Selection</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Expand your study to include a larger sample size, encompassing both clinical and reference strains. This will strengthen the validity of your findings.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We agree with the importance of a broader sample. In the revised manuscript, we have added one additional ST-low-susceptible MRSA clinical isolate (KAM1160) to address the small sample size. We have explicitly noted in the Discussion section that the limited strain selection is a study limitation, and we emphasize the need to examine more strains in future studies.</p><p>Major Point 2: Literature Review</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Re-evaluate your claim regarding the lack of in vitro studies for the TMP/SMX + rifampin combination in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. A reviewer has pointed out at least one relevant study (El Haj et al., 2018) that you should acknowledge and discuss.&#8221;</p><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We have revised the manuscript to acknowledge the prior in vitro study by El Haj et al. (2018) that examined the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) + rifampin combination in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) biofilm model. In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we now cite this study and compare our methods and findings with those of El Haj et al.</p><p>Major Point 3: Guidelines</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Broaden your discussion of guidelines to include international perspectives, not just those from Japan. This will increase the relevance of your work for a global audience.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have expanded our manuscript to include international guidelines as suggested. In addition to the Japanese guidelines (2019) that were originally cited, the Introduction and Discussion of the revised manuscript now reference key international guidelines on MRSA treatment. Specifically, we have added the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of MRSA infections, which mention oral combination therapy with ST plus RFP for certain indications (e.g., bone and joint infections). We also cite the 2021 UK MRSA treatment guidelines, which note that while RFP combinations were once considered (especially for biofilm-related infections), there is no clear evidence supporting their efficacy in that context. Furthermore, as noted by the Editor, we have included the European Pediatric Bone and Joint Infection Guidelines which recommend ST plus RFP in specific scenarios. By incorporating these sources, we have ensured that our discussion is internationally relevant and provides a more comprehensive perspective beyond the Japanese context.</p><p>Major Point 4: Strain Characterization (MIC Discrepancies)</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Clarify the discrepancies in MIC values for your clinical strains, particularly regarding the strain with an intermediate MIC to TMP/SMX. Discuss the implications of these differences on your results and conclusions.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We investigated the noted discrepancies in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values by performing additional experiments for clarification. We reconfirmed the MIC of ST for each clinical isolate using both the standard microdilution method and the E-test, alongside the quality control strain (ATCC 29213) to ensure accuracy of the methods.</p><p>For strain KAM636, which originally appeared to have an intermediate MIC of ST, the E-test revealed slight bacterial growth within the inhibition zone, corresponding to an MIC of 16 &#181;g/mL. This finding explains the previous discrepancy, as 16 &#181;g/mL indicates a resistant level (above the susceptibility breakpoint). We have corrected the reported MIC of KAM636 in the revised manuscript to 16 &#181;g/mL and clarified that this strain is ST-resistant.</p><p>For the newly added clinical isolate KAM1160 (ST-low-susceptible strain), the E-test yielded an MIC of 3 &#181;g/mL. According to the E-test manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, when an MIC falls between two standard dilution values, it should be rounded up to the higher two-fold concentration. Therefore, 3 &#181;g/mL is interpreted as 4 &#181;g/mL in broth microdilution equivalence, which falls into the resistant category (non-susceptible). In the revised manuscript, we now describe KAM1160 as a &#8220;ST low-susceptible (ST-LS) strain,&#8221; reflecting its borderline resistance.</p><p>We have updated the Results and Discussion sections to explain these MIC differences and their implications. Importantly, both clinical strains tested are now clearly identified as not fully susceptible to ST (one intermediate/low-susceptible and one resistant), and we discuss how the combination therapy efficacy was observed particularly in these non-susceptible strains. These clarifications ensure that our conclusions appropriately consider the variability in MIC results.</p><p>Major Point 5: Resistance Development</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Address whether you checked for the development of rifampin resistance in your experiments, particularly for the KAM444 strain that regained growth.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have addressed this important point by analyzing whether rifampin resistance emerged during our chemostat model experiments. For each clinical isolate, we measured the MICs of ST and RFP for bacteria surviving after the 24-hour chemostat experiment. We found that in all cases the MIC of RFP increased substantially after exposure to rifampin alone, indicating that RFP resistance was indeed induced during the experiment (RFP monotherapy led to resistant subpopulations). We have added these findings to the Results and have expanded the Discussion to note that the development of RFP resistance is a significant concern when RFP is used alone, which further supports the rationale for combination therapy in our study.</p><p>Major Point 6: Clinical Relevance</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Provide a more nuanced discussion of the clinical applicability of your findings, particularly regarding the use of this combination therapy for TMP/SMX-resistant strains and in cases of sepsis or bacteremia.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We appreciate this suggestion and have revised the Discussion to more carefully frame the clinical relevance of our findings. First, we emphasize that our study is based solely on in vitro experiments, and thus we do not intend to directly recommend changes to current clinical treatment practices at this stage.</p><p>Second, we have added a nuanced perspective on potential clinical applicability. Specifically, we discuss that the ST plus RFP combination might be considered as a future therapeutic option in certain limited scenarios &#8211; for example, in situations where an MRSA infection is suspected but the organism&#8217;s ST susceptibility is unknown (and obtaining rapid MIC results is not feasible), and an effective oral regimen is needed (such as for step-down therapy or when IV treatment is not possible). In summary, the revised discussion highlights the potential value of our findings as a basis for future research; however, further data accumulation will be necessary before these findings can be applied clinically.</p><p>Minor Point 1: Figure Quality</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Improve the quality of Figure 1, which was reported as blurry.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We apologize for the suboptimal quality of Figure 1 in the initial submission. To resolve this issue, we have replaced Figure 1 with a high-resolution version in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Minor Point 2: Language and Formatting</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Address the specific language and formatting suggestions made by the reviewers, including: (a) Removing the word &#8216;therapy&#8217; where inappropriate, (b) Correcting alignment issues in Table 2, (c) Reconsidering certain assertive statements, (d) Using passive forms where appropriate, (e) Properly referencing laboratory products.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have made all the recommended language and formatting corrections in the revised manuscript:</p><p>&#8226; a. Use of &#8220;therapy&#8221;: We removed the word &#8220;therapy&#8221; in contexts where it was inappropriate for an in vitro study (specifically, we deleted &#8220;therapy&#8221; on original manuscript lines 44 and 312, where its use implied clinical treatment).</p><p>&#8226; b. Table 2 alignment: We corrected the alignment problems in Table 2. All columns and entries in Table 2 are now properly aligned and formatted consistently.</p><p>&#8226; c. Assertive statements: We revised an overly assertive sentence in the Discussion (original lines 273&#8211;274). The wording has been toned down to a more cautious statement, reflecting the fact that our conclusions are based on in vitro results with a limited number of strains.</p><p>&#8226; d. Passive voice: We have adjusted the manuscript text to use passive voice where appropriate to improve the formal tone.</p><p>&#8226; e. Referencing laboratory products: We have added proper references or source information for all laboratory products and reagents mentioned in the Methods.</p><p>We believe these changes have improved the clarity and readability of the manuscript in line with the reviewers&#8217; suggestions.</p><p>Additional Suggestion 1: Number of Replicates</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Explain why only two replicates were conducted instead of three.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s comment regarding experimental replicates. All experiments initially demonstrated high reproducibility with two replicates, supporting the reliability of our data. To enhance robustness, the revised manuscript includes a third replicate for the MIC assay and checkerboard assay, which confirmed consistency. For the chemostat model, due to the demanding nature of the 24-hour protocol, two replicates were conducted, both yielding highly similar results. These details are clearly described in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additional Suggestion 2: Removal of a Sentence</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Consider removing or revising the sentence about a previous report (lines 260-261) as suggested by Reviewer 1.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have removed the sentence in the Discussion referring to a &#8220;previous report&#8221; (along with the associated reference 19) as suggested.</p><p>Additional Suggestion 3: Referencing Web Address</p><p>Comment (Editor): &#8220;Add the web address mentioned on line 267 to your reference list.&#8221;</p><p>Response: In accordance with this suggestion (and Reviewer 1&#8217;s comment), we have added the previously unreferenced web address (from line 267) as a formal citation in the reference list (Ref. 23).</p><p>Response to Reviewer #1</p><p>Reviewer #1: &#8220;The study is generally well-planned and the manuscript is generally well-written. I have few recommendations about the manuscript.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We thank Reviewer #1 for the positive feedback on our study design and writing. We appreciate the specific recommendations and have addressed each point in the revised manuscript, as detailed below:</p><p>Comment 1 (Lines 44 and 312): &#8220;Remove the word &#8216;therapy&#8217; because this is not a clinical study.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have removed the word &#8220;therapy&#8221; from the relevant sentences in the manuscript (original lines 44 and 312), as suggested. We agree that since our work is an in vitro study and not a clinical trial, using the term &#8220;therapy&#8221; in those contexts was inappropriate.</p><p>Comment 2 (Line 47): &#8220;Write &#8216;against&#8217; instead of &#8216;therapy of&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have revised the phrasing at line 47 in the manuscript. The phrase &#8220;the therapy of&#8221; has been replaced with &#8220;against&#8221; so that the sentence now correctly reads with &#8220;against&#8221; (e.g., &#8220;activity against MRSA&#8221;) rather than implying &#8220;therapy.&#8221;</p><p>Comment 3 (Table 2): &#8220;Some alignment problems exist in some columns of Table 2. These should be corrected.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have corrected the alignment issues in Table 2 of the manuscript. All columns in Table 2 are now properly aligned.</p><p>Comment 4 (Lines 260-261): &#8220;I recommend the authors remove the sentence &#8216;In a previous report, RFP&#8230;&#8217; and reference 19. In the cited report, although rifampicin and minocycline considerably decreased both WT and SCVs, both bacterial counts recovered to the initial number 48 hours later.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We agree with this recommendation. We have removed the sentence in question (about the previous report on rifampicin and minocycline) as well as the corresponding reference 19 from the Discussion. As the reviewer noted, that cited study&#8217;s findings (rifampicin + minocycline reducing MRSA counts only temporarily) did not directly support our discussion, and omitting it has made our narrative more concise and clear.</p><p>Comment 5 (Line 267): &#8220;A number can be given for the web address and this reference can be added to the references list.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have added a numbered citation for the web address mentioned in line 267 of the original manuscript. Specifically, the web resource is now included as an entry in the reference list, and we cite it in the text by its reference number.</p><p>Comment 6 (Lines 273-274): &#8220;This sentence is a bit assertive. This was an in vitro study and the number of strains tested in this study was low. You can use a more appropriate sentence or you should support this sentence with information obtained from clinical studies.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We appreciate this comment and have revised the sentence in lines 273&#8211;274 to tone down the assertiveness. In the original manuscript, that sentence overstated the implications of our findings. We have rewritten it to be more cautious and context-appropriate, given that our evidence comes from an in vitro study with a small sample of strains.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #2</p><p>Reviewer #2: [General comment] &#8220;The article presents some intriguing findings, yet it is imperative to substantiate these outcomes with a more extensive sample size, encompassing both clinical and reference strains.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We thank Reviewer #2 for the overall positive view of our findings and the important suggestions. We have implemented changes to address the concerns raised. Below are our point-by-point responses to each comment:</p><p>Comment 1: Sample size of strains</p><p>&#8220;The article presents some intriguing findings, yet it is imperative to substantiate these outcomes with a more extensive sample size, encompassing both clinical and reference strains.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We completely agree that a larger sample size would strengthen the study. In response, we have added an additional MRSA clinical isolate to our experiments. Specifically, we included one more ST-low-susceptible MRSA clinical strain (KAM1160) and repeated the key experiments for combination efficacy with this strain. We have incorporated these new results into the revised manuscript. We have also explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion that the total number of strains tested is still small, and we have listed the limited sample size as a limitation of our study.</p><p>Comment 2: &#8220;In the event of a resubmission, other factors will have to be taken into consideration.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We understand the reviewer&#8217;s remark and agree that there are additional factors which could be important to explore in subsequent studies (for example, different strain backgrounds, resistance mechanisms, or in vivo conditions). For the current revision, we focused on the specific major points raised by all reviewers.</p><p>Comment 3: &#8220;It is preferable to utilize passive forms.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have reviewed the manuscript for tone and voice, and we have revised many sentences to use the passive voice where appropriate.</p><p>Comment 4: &#8220;Please clarify why only two replicates were conducted, rather than three.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We have clarified this point in the revised Methods and Results. Most experiments initially showed high reproducibility with two replicates. To ensure robustness, a third replicate was added for the MIC and checkerboard assays, confirming consistent results. For the chemostat experiments, only two replicates were conducted due to the complexity and labor-intensive nature of the 24-hour protocol. Both runs showed nearly identical outcomes, supporting the reliability of the data.</p><p>Comment 5: &#8220;The sources of the laboratory products in question are not adequately referenced.&#8221;</p><p>Response: We have updated the manuscript to include proper source information</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323935.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">250416_Responses_to_Reviewer.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0323935.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0323935.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323935.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Omri</surname><given-names initials="A">Abdelwahab</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Abdelwahab Omri</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Abdelwahab Omri</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj004" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40392929"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
