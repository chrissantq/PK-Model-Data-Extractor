Among them, the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been the most investigated. These works aim to evaluate the efficacy of the new fluorescent tracer LightSpot-FL-1 for quantifying P-gp in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a acute leukemia cell lines, as well as in blood samples from healthy donors and leukemic patients. First, The P-gp quantity in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells measured by LightSpot-FL-1, was 7052&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2789 FU and 27,666&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6706 FU, respectively. Then, cells exposure to 10&#160;&#181;M daunorubicin (DNR) for 3&#160;h reduced P-gp expression by 54% in CCRF-CEM cells and by 62% in KG-1a cells. Moreover, this decrease preceded a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability detected after 24&#160;h of exposure to 10&#160;&#181;M DNR, with 46.6% and 72.2% viable cells for CCRF-CEM and KG-1a, respectively. These findings suggest that P-gp downregulation could serve as a potential biomarker of treatment efficacy. Additionally, LightSpot-FL-1 analysis of six acute myeloid leukemia patient blood samples allowed the identification of 14 distinct blast subpopulations, revealing substantial inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity in P-gp expression. Thus, these findings underscore the potential of LightSpot-FL-1 as a valuable tool for re-evaluating the clinical relevance of P-gp in tumor resistance diagnosis.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-03370-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multi-drug resistance</kwd><kwd>P-gp</kwd><kwd>LightSpot-FL-1 fluorescent probe</kwd><kwd>Daunorubicin</kwd><kwd>Acute leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Plan de relance, DRV_PIP_2021-115_UCA_ANR_ANR21-PRRD-0009-01_RESIST</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Comit&#233; du Puy-de-D&#244;me de la Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters, which belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, contribute to anticancer treatment failure by acting as efflux pumps for a large variety of xenobiotics with varied structures and physiochemical properties. To date, three MDR proteins present a clinical interest i.e., the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), deeply investigated for its role in tumor resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and the Multi-Drug Resistance-associated Protein 7 (MRP7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. P-gp plays a major role in the multidrug-resistant phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, this ubiquitous MDR protein is naturally expressed in a wide variety of living organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, including cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. At the cellular level, P-gp is expressed at the cell membrane, preventing extended intracellular accumulation of xenobiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, P-gp is present on the membranes of intracellular organelles such as vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, contributing to intracellular drug compartmentalization and further, to the development of cell resistance.</p><p id="Par3">Despite the great interest in using P-gp as a therapeutic target, reliable and effective methodologies for its quantification in clinical practice are missing. In this context, our research group has developed LightSpot-FL-1, a P-gp-targeted fluorescent conjugate. This small molecule enables the specific detection and quantification of P-gp in cells or cellular masses such as spheroids. The P-gp labeling efficiency of LightSpot-FL-1 has already been demonstrated in DU4475 breast cancer cells in suspension, as well as in monolayer and spheroid cell cultures from the SUM1315 triple-negative breast cancer cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These advancements make LightSpot-FL-1 an interesting tool, with great potential for evaluating the clinical relevance of P-gp in tumor resistance diagnosis.</p><p id="Par4">Indeed, despite the advancement of new standards and targeted therapies, some cancers, especially Acute Leukemias (AL), remain highly refractory to treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. AL are malignant disorders characterized by the clonal expansion of immature and undifferentiated hematopoietic cells called blasts, resulting in their accumulation in the bone marrow. In this malignant transformation process, blast cells progressively replace healthy cells in this compartment and finally lead to depletion of differentiated cells in the blood. AL are classified based on the origin of the clonal cell, distinguishing between lymphoid and myeloid lineages. For several decades, the initial therapeutic approach as involved the concurrent administration of an anthracycline such as daunorubicin (DNR) during the first three days of treatment, and an antimetabolite, cytarabine (Ara-C) for seven days. This therapy is commonly referred to as the &#8220;7&#8201;+&#8201;3 regimen&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Despite the implementation of this therapeutic approach, the overall survival rate at five years post-treatment averages between 40 and 60%, with a significant decline to 15&#8211;20% in patients aged over 60<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These poor survivals reflect the importance of the resistance mechanisms employed by cancer cells in these hematological tumors. MDR proteins in particular are thought to play a critical role in establishing this resistance. Therefore, the direct detection and quantification of P-gp expression level in leukemia cancer cells at diagnosis could help identifying intrinsic drug resistance and provide opportunities for treatment optimization.</p><p id="Par5">Consequently, numerous clinical studies attempted to correlate the P-gp expression level in AL patients to their survival and relapse rates. Many of these studies led to the conclusion that this association lacked clinical relevance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Other research focused on the most immature blast subpopulation CD34+ cells, identified as leukemic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Results suggested that CD34+ blast cells exhibit higher P-gp expression compared to more mature cancer cells and could potentially influence patients outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes and the absence of standardized, clinically adaptable methods for quantifying the P-gp expression in the different blast cell subpopulations.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, we investigate the P-gp quantification using the new P-gp-targeted fluorescent tracer LightSpot-FL-1, and explore its applicability for clinical diagnostics. For this, acute leukemia cell line models (CCRF-CEM and KG-1a) as well as white blood cells (WBCs) from healthy controls and blast cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were used. This article is the first to investigate the use of this fluorescent tracer on patient samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>LightSpot-FL-1 penetration kinetics and P-gp targeting in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cell lines by flow cytometry analysis</title><p id="Par7">To validate P-gp labeling with LightSpot-FL-1, the penetration and stability of the fluorescent tracer were analyzed over time in the acute leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and KG-1a (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>LightSpot-FL-1 penetration kinetics and P-gp targeting in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cell lines.

A clear decrease in LightSpot-FL-1 fluorescent signal was detected in both cell lines at 60&#160;min with 7209&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2789 FU for CCRF-CEM cells and 27,666&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6706 FU for KG-1a cells.

The quantification of P-gp at diagnosis and/or at the time of relapse is of particular interest for cancers that are highly refractory to treatment. Despite the development of novel therapies, including immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies, the standard regimen of DNR combined with Ara-C remains the first-line treatment for acute leukemia. However, this regimen is associated with suboptimal outcomes, particularly in elderly patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The phenomenon of Multi-Drug Resistance is complex and can arise from various mechanisms. The overexpression of the P-glycoprotein is one of the currently explored options, with a trend suggesting the involvement of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in P-gp-mediated resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, the majority of studies on this subject arrive at different conclusions and no study investigated the expression levels of P-gp across a range of more mature blast subpopulations. This lack of consensus may be attributed to several factors, including the absence of a standardized, cost-effective and easily implementable methodology for efficient detection and quantification of P-gp in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par22">In this context, our research has focused on the application of the P-gp-targeted fluorescent tracer LightSpot-FL-1 on two acute leukemia cell line models <italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., CCRF-CEM and KG-1a, as well as on white blood cell populations from healthy donors and blast cells from patients diagnosed with AML. This represents the first reported application of LightSpot-FL1 on clinical samples.</p><p id="Par23">We first checked the ability of LightSpot-FL-1 to specifically bind P-gp in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells by flow cytometry analyses. The lipophilic property of the tracer permits a rapid cellular penetration within the first minutes of exposure. A part of LightSpot-FL-1 was persistently retained in cells up to 2&#160;h after washing. This part corresponds to 13% and 33% of the signal measured before the washing step for CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells, respectively. These results show that LightSpot-FL-1 specifically binds P-gp over time and reveal a differential P-gp expression between the two cell line models, suggesting that KG-1a cells express approximately 4 times more P-gp than CCRF-CEM cells.</p><p id="Par24">Subsequently, the uptake of DNR, known for being a P-gp substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, was investigated in the presence and absence of verapamil, a competitive P-gp inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The presence of verapamil had no impact on the intracellular accumulation of DNR in low P-gp expressing CCRF-CEM cells. In contrast, in the KG-1a cells, which exhibit a higher P-gp expression, DNR accumulation increased by 52% in the presence of verapamil. Thus, the level of P-gp expression in cells influence the intracellular accumulation of anticancer agents. Therefore, we subsequently investigated the effect of exposure to increasing concentrations of DNR on both P-gp expression and cell viability over time.</p><p id="Par25">The relationship between P-gp expression levels, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.e., cellular drug resistance and treatment efficacy through cell viability analysis was investigated. Interestingly, a decrease in P-gp levels was detected in both cell lines after high DNR concentration exposure that systematically precede a decrease in cell viability. Indeed, the treatment with 10&#160;&#181;M DNR for 3&#160;h resulted in 55% and 62% decrease in P-gp levels for CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells, respectively. After 24&#160;h of 10&#160;&#181;M DNR exposure, the P-gp expression rate decreased dramatically by 87% and 80% for CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells, respectively. Regarding the cell viability, after 24&#160;h of 10&#160;&#181;M DNR exposure this parameter dropped to 47% and 72% in CCRF-CEM and KG-1a cells, respectively. These results suggest that a drop in P-gp expression level following anticancer therapy may serve as an early indicator of treatment efficacy.</p><p id="Par26">After validating the efficacy of LightSpot-FL-1 on in vitro cellular models of AL, we extended our study to assess the effectiveness of P-gp labeling in primary cells from healthy donors and patients with AML. Subsequently, LightSpot-FL-1 P-gp labeling and immunostaining were compared in monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes from three healthy donors. The P-gp expression level was much higher in monocytes than in neutrophils and lymphocytes, regardless of the methodology. Indeed, the P-gp expression in monocytes measured with LightSpot-FL-1 was 5.79 and 2.04 times higher on average than in neutrophils and lymphocytes, respectively. Regarding immunostaining, the P-gp expression in monocytes was found 14.85 and 12.29 times higher on average than in neutrophils and lymphocytes, respectively. Despite similar quantification profiles, differences can be detected between the two techniques. This highlights the ability of the LightSpot-FL-1 tracer to target both P-gp expressed at the cell membrane and intracellular P-gp, unlike immunostaining which only targets an external epitope. This is a clear advantage of the LightSpot technology, as intracellular P-gp was shown to be a significant factor in overall drug resistance, particularly in AL models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Inter-individual variability in the WBCs P-gp expression of the three healthy donors was also detected. This natural variability results from the combined influence of genetic and environmental factors on the expression of MDR proteins, particularly P-gp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the total quantification of cell membrane and intracellular P-gp by LightSpot-FL-1 underscores its advantages in predicting global cell resistance, thereby demonstrating its applicability and relevance for clinical P-gp investigation.</p><p id="Par27">Finally, LightSpot-FL-1 was used in combination with a panel of clinically relevant membrane antibodies to quantify P-gp in blast subpopulations from six patients diagnosed with AML. The collected data revealed that significant variations can be detected by using LightSpot-FL-1, both in the average P-gp expression levels in blast cells among patients and within fourteen distinct blast subpopulations of a given patient. These encouraging preliminary results pave the way to investigating inter and intra-individual P-gp expression variabilities with LightSpot-FL1 on a broader sample. If confirmed, such variabilities could partially explain the inconsistencies observed in studies attempting to predict tumor resistance based on the average P-gp expression level of blast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

According to the ethical regulations of our institution and French law (Article L.1211-2 al.2 du Code de la sant&#233; publique), such research does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Additionally, as per our institutional policy, all patients systematically sign a non-opposition statement, allowing the use of their biological samples for research purposes. Indeed, all patients included in the study were informed via the CHU Clermont-Fd welcome booklet that the remaining biological samples taken during their diagnosis and follow-up could be used for research unless they objected; no patient expressed their objection. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation-alternatives><element-citation id="ec-CR1" publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Bosch</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Croop</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance and cancer</article-title><source>Biochim.
