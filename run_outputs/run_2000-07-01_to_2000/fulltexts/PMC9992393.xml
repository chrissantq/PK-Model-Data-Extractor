The whey acidic protein four-disulfide core domain gene <italic toggle="yes">WFDC12</italic> is highly expressed in skin tissue and up-regulated in the skin lesions of AD patients, but its role and relevant mechanism in AD pathogenesis have not been studied yet. In this study, we found that the expression of WFDC12 was closely related to clinical symptoms of AD and the severity of AD-like lesions induced by DNFB in transgenic mice. WFDC12-overexpressing in the epidermis might promote the migration of skin-presenting cells to lymph nodes and increase Th cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the number and ratio of immune cells and mRNA levels of cytokines were significantly upregulated in transgenic mice. In addition, we found that <italic toggle="yes">ALOX12/15</italic> gene expression was upregulated in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, and the corresponding metabolite accumulation was increased. The activity of epidermal serine hydrolase decreased and the accumulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) increased in the epidermis of transgenic mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that WFDC12 may contribute to the exacerbation of AD-like symptoms in DNFB-induced mouse model by enhancing arachidonic acid metabolism and PAF accumulation and that WFDC12 may be a potential therapeutic target for human atopic dermatitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>Immunogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31271483</award-id><award-id>31872739</award-id><award-id>81472650</award-id><award-id>81573050</award-id><award-id>81673061</award-id><award-id>30300313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100012551</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Provincial Department of Science and Technology | Applied Basic Research Program of Sichuan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2008SZ0093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Science and Technology Major Project Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province Sichuan Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease characterized by impaired skin barrier, immune disorders, and dysbiosis of skin flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 20% of children and 10% of adults in developed countries are affected by AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is clinically manifested as chronic lesions such as recurrent erythema eczema, dry skin, and severe itching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The prevalence of changes in mood and sleeping disorders in AD patients is higher than that in the normal population, and normal life is hideously disturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients&#8217; epidermal barrier is usually blocked by genetic or other incentives, resulting in augmenting the percutaneous filtration rate and the barrier permeability, increasing the invasiveness of the penetrable antigens such as microbes and allergens from the external environment to the inside body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], enhancing the absorption and presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as epidermal Langerhans-cells (LCs) and dermic reside dendritic cells (rDCs) and the migration of APCs to the lymph nodes. Antigen presentation activates T cells and activates effector T cells migrate to the skin and participate in the regulation of local immune responses. Skin inflammation is the core mechanism of AD. In childhood or the acute phase of AD, the Th2-mediated immune response is the main mechanism in the human body. During this period, the release of the alarmins caused by the destruction of the epidermal barrier activates APCs, which migrate to lymph nodes and activate CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells to become Th2 cells and migrate to the skin lesions. The activated Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-13, which promote the production of antigen-specific IgE through signal transduction in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the lesions of patients, keratinocytes release alarmins such as IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) to send pro-inflammatory and itchy signals. With the development of AD and the occurrence of chronic inflammation, Th1/Th17 cells become active and dominated via secreting a variety of cytokines to activate other immune cells and cooperate with inflammatory factors. Skin resident immune cells and T cells that migrate to lymph nodes produce large amounts of cytokines that recruit and activate other immune cells to regulate inflammation. With the progression of inflammation in the skin, mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils are involved in regulating the skin&#8217;s immune microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The pathogenesis of AD contains many complex factors such as genetics, environment, and psychology, and the existing drug therapy has limited effects and certain side effects. Therefore, it is urgent to further study the mechanism and correlated functional molecules of AD to lay a foundation for the development of new drug targets and clinical treatment.</p><p id="Par3">Arachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 20 carbon atoms and 4 double bounds, is mainly esterified to phospholipids at the second carbon (sn-2) of the phospholipid glycerol backbone of the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. When keratinocytes respond to skin irritation and injury, AA is released from phospholipid by the action of phospholipases, and AA metabolism is then activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Increasing evidence highlights that AA metabolism and relevant enzymatic pathways are widely involved in many inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], such as asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], etc. However, the role of AA metabolism and relevant metabolic enzymes in the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive.</p><p id="Par4">There are so many proteases and endogenous protease inhibitor molecules in human beings&#8217; skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They catalyze different substrates to form a complex hydrolysis network and play a role as key signal molecules in the cellular pathway and then participate in various physiological functions such as epidermal differentiation and desquamation, lipid synthesis, and cytokine secretion. The dysregulation of biochemical reactions caused by proteases is a key factor in the occurrence and development of various human skin diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Endogenous protease inhibitor molecules also play a vital role in maintaining normal skin physiological functions and resisting the attack of skin diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The whey acidic protein 4-disulfide core domain 12 (WFDC12) is a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family, which has a core disulfide domain and has pleiotropic effects on protease inhibition, antibacterial and antiviral activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, the member of this family WFDC14, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), and WFDC5 are highly expressed in the skin and participate in the regulation of skin homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Meanwhile, SLPI has a higher plasma content in AD patients and promotes the migration of eosinophils to the lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Both SLPI and WFDC14 have been shown to play an irreplaceable role in the development of psoriasis. These studies indicate that the members of this family have great academic and practical values in the clinical development and application in skin inflammatory diseases. As a molecule highly expressed in human skin specifically, WFDC12 is highly expressed in non-skin lesions and skin lesions in psoriasis and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but its characteristic role and underlying mechanisms in skin homeostasis and skin diseases remain mysterious.</p><p id="Par5">Our findings revealed the unique role and potential mechanism of WFDC12 and AA metabolism pathway in the occurrence and development of AD, providing an experimental basis and theoretical basis for the clarification of AD pathogenesis and the search for new clinical drug targets and treatment methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The expression of WFDC12 positively correlated with AD clinical feature</title><p id="Par6">To explore the association between WFDC12 and AD, we first analyzed the mRNA levels of WFDC12 in different human tissues through the <italic toggle="yes">GTEx</italic> database. The results showed that the expression level of WFDC12 was the highest in the skin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), indicating that WFDC12 might play an important role in the occurrence and development of skin-related diseases. Then, we examined WFDC12 protein expression level and distribution in the healthy human skin tissue and the skin lesions of AD patients by using immunohistochemical staining. WFDC12 was mainly located in the epidermis of the skin and was mainly expressed in the highly differentiated stratum corneous (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Compared with normal skin tissue, WFDC12 expression was significantly increased in the skin tissue of AD patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) treatment was performed on the dorsal skin of wild-type mice (WT) to construct the AD mouse model and the mRNA level of WFDC12 in the lesions was detected. The results showed that WFDC12 was significantly increased in the skin lesion of the modeled mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the level of WFDC12 in the <italic toggle="yes">GDS2820</italic> with normal mouse skin and DNFB-induced AD-like skin tissue. And we found that the mRNA level of WFDC12 in the skin lesion area of the modeled mice was higher (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), which was consistent with the results obtained in our experiments.

In the inflammatory state, those cytokines such as IL-17A and TNF-&#945; in epidermal keratinocytes promote the transcription and expression of transcription factor AP-1 and enhance its binding to the AP-1 binding site in the upstream region of WFDC12, leading to the up-regulation of WFDC12 expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the high expression of WFDC12 in AD lesions.

Therefore, we surmised that there might be a corresponding alternative mechanism for the protease and protease inhibitor interaction network to maintain skin homeostasis and ensure the normal function of the skin barrier.

T cells migrating to the epidermis produce many cytokines, while keratinocytes, DC cells, and macrophages inherent in the skin also secrete chemokines and cytokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL19, which further recruit monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils and other immune cells to infiltrate the inflammatory site. In K14-WFDC12 mice, the infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils was increased in the skin, and the expressions of inflammatory factors such as IL-4, IL-33, CXCL9, and TSLP were significantly up-regulated. The foregoing data show that skin-specific overexpression of WFDC12 may facilitate the migration of APCs with the ability to migrate to lymph nodes and enhance the differentiation of T cells, taking part in the regulation of the skin immune microenvironment.</p><p id="Par24">Transcriptome sequencing is an important research method to study pathological mechanisms. In this paper, we took mouse back skin tissue for transcriptome sequencing. Consistent with the above experimental results, the Th1/Th2 differentiation-related signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway were activated in the mice after modeling. Meanwhile, the PPAR signaling pathway related to lipid metabolism was also activated in the skin after DNFB induction, indicating that lipid metabolism may play an indispensable role in the DNFB-induced AD model. What&#8217;s more, these DEGs were mainly concentrated in pathways of cytokines, ECM, and lipid metabolism after WFDC12-overexpressing. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis of lesions and non-lesions in AD patients revealed that AA metabolism was abnormal in the lesions of AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, AA binds to cell membranes to form supporting complex membrane phospholipids. AA was hydrolyzed off the membrane with the help of phospholipases when cells received external stimulators and AA metabolism is activated. There are three main pathways of AA metabolism: epoxidase pathway (COXs pathway), lipoxygenases pathway (LOXs pathway), and cytochromes pathway (CYPs pathway). AA metabolism pathways contain a wide variety of enzymes, and their metabolites play important physiological regulatory functions in inflammation, fever, blood pressure, reproductive system, respiratory system, etc. Therefore, the AA metabolic pathway in this KEGG enrichment result attracted our attention. We then conducted a validation test. In DNFB-induced K14-WFDC12 transgenic mice, the expression of lipoxygenases ALOX12 and ALOX15 in the AA metabolic pathway was upregulated significantly. Some studies have shown that 12/15-LOX and their derivatives function in epithelial inflammatory diseases and epithelial injury repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. ALOX15-deficient mice showed a deficiency of ALOX15-derived lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), as well as defects in corneal re-epithelialization and neutrophil recruitment. But in our study, ALOX12/15 silencing in mouse PAM212 keratinocytes did not affect the ability of proliferation and migration (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). In studies of lipid composition in keratinocyte-derived human epidermal equivalents from AD patients, 12/15-LOX-derived products 12/15-HETE were found to be the major metabolite of the lipoxygenase pathway in AD pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our study, the expression of ALOX15/12 was up-regulated in the skin of K14-WFDC12 mice, and the content of major metabolite 12/15-HETE was also clearly increased. 12/15-HETE has been shown to be an active mediator of lipids exerting proinflammatory effects. In conclusion, we hypothesized that WFDC12 may regulate the process of the skin immune microenvironment by up-regulating the metabolic pathway of AA lipoxygenase.</p><p id="Par25">WFDC12 is a member of the serine protease suppressor family, and the recombinant WFDC12 protein has inhibitory effects on kallikrein 7 (KLK7) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. KLK7 is specifically highly expressed in the epidermis and is mainly associated with the process of cuticle desquamate and some studies have shown that the absence of WFDC12 has no effect on AD-like inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. HNE acts a proinflammatory role in most inflammatory diseases, so existing reports on WFDC12 substrate do not well explain our findings. Based on the above study, we hypothesized that WFDC12 has other functional substrates to activate the lipoxygenase ALOX12/15 pathway of AA to function in a pro-inflammatory role in the more complex physiological environment in vivo and then tested it. CYP4F14 and PAF-AH were found to regulate AA metabolism. The former regulates the downstream pathway of AA metabolism and metabolizes and inactivates the proinflammatory mediator LTB4 which is the product of AA metabolism by lipoxygenase 5 (ALOX5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. PAF-AH is the only enzyme that can regulate the hydrolysis of PAF. Once PAF-AH is disabled or inhibited, PAF accumulates in the body. PAF is a proinflammatory lipid mediator and functions in many inflammatory diseases by binding to the receptor PAF-R. In the skin, PAF regulates the expression of cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1&#946; in keratinocytes by binding to PAF-R in the keratinocyte epidermis. Based on the above, we demonstrate a potential molecular mechanism by which WFDC12 promotes DNFB-induced AD inflammation by regulating AA metabolic pathways and related enzyme activities (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). When the skin is exposed to external irritation, membrane phospholipids are broken down into LYSO-PAF (precursor of PAF) and free AA under the action of phospholipase A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. On the one hand, LYSO-PAF is metabolized into PAF and enters the cell via a receptor (PAF-R). WFDC12 inactivates PAF-AH to make the accumulation of PAF in cells rapidly and to stimulate the augment of chemokines and cytokines, thus causing enhanced inflammatory response. On the other hand, free AA increased and AA metabolism in cells was strengthened. In the LOXs pathway, AA can be metabolized by ALOX5 to LTB4 (a potent chemotactic lipid mediator that can be inactivated by CYP 4F14) or directly metabolized by ALOX12/15 to 12/15-HETE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. WFDC12 inhibits the activity of CYP 4F14, which can lead to the increase of LTB4 and enhance the secretion of various factors. Meanwhile, CYP 4F14 was inactivated in the AA CYPs pathway, which enhanced the metabolism of the ALOX12/15 pathway, resulting in the increase of 12/15-HETE and further aggravation of AD symptoms. Taken together, WFDC12 may activate the ALOX12/15 pathway in AA metabolism by affecting the activity of epidermal PAF-AH and CYP 4F14, thus promoting the accumulation of relevant inflammatory lipid mediators and participating in the regulation of AD pathogenesis and progression.</p><p id="Par26">It is worth mentioning that we did not construct WFDC12-knockout mice and perform corresponding verification and explore whether WFDC12 function loss has a protective effect on DNFB induction, which may be an important aspect of our future experiments. In addition, in our current experimental designs, direct interactions between WFDC12 and 3 potential interacting substrates CYP 4F14, PAF-AHIBI (encoding PAF-AHI&#946; subunit), and PAF-AH2 (single subunit polypeptide) were not explored. This will be the focus of our subsequent work to identify the molecules that play an exact or major role in the overall mechanism.</p><p id="Par27">In summary, our study found that the specific high expression of WFDC12 in epidermal keratinocytes plays an irreplaceable role in promoting the development of AD by regulating AA metabolism. Meanwhile, we combined these research means in cell biology, transcriptomics, and protease activity studies to investigate the related mechanism of WFDC12 in regulating the pathogenesis of AD, which provides new insights and theoretical basis for the elucidation of the pathogenesis, new diagnosis, and treatment methods and the search for potent drug targets of AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par28">The K14-WFDC12 transgenic mice were commissioned to construct by <italic toggle="yes">Saiye Biotechnology Co., Ltd</italic>.
