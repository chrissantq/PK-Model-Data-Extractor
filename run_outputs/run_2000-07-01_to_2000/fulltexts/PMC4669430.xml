Moreover, management of hypertension requires long-term treatment that may result in poor patient compliance with conventional dosage forms due to greater frequency of drug administration. Although there is availability of a plethora of therapeutically effective antihypertensive molecules, inadequate patient welfare is observed; this arguably presents an opportunity to deliver antihypertensive agents through a different route. Ever since the transdermal drug delivery came into existence, it has offered great advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. Attempts were made to develop the transdermal therapeutic system for various antihypertensive agents, including &#946;-blockers, an important antihypertensive class. &#946;-blockers are potent, highly effective in the management of hypertension and other heart ailments by blocking the effects of normal amounts of adrenaline in the heart and blood vessels. The shortcomings associated with &#946;-blockers such as more frequent dose administration, extensive first pass metabolism and variable bioavailability, make them an ideal candidate for transdermal therapeutic systems. The present article gives a brief view of different &#946;-blockers formulated as transdermal therapeutic system in detail to enhance the bioavailability as well as to improve patient compliance. Constant improvement in this field holds promise for the long-term success in technologically advanced transdermal dosage forms being commercialized sooner rather than later.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antihypertensive agent</kwd><kwd>&#946;-Blockers</kwd><kwd>Transdermal delivery</kwd><kwd>Transdermal therapeutic system</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The potential of using intact skin as the route of drug administration has been known for several years. The inspiration for using skin for the delivery of drug is obtained from ancient times. In recent times, development of transdermal delivery system started in 1970s, and in 1979, the first transdermal patch of scopolamine was approved by USFDA for the treatment of motion sickness and later on a nitroglycerine patch was marketed for the management of angina pectoris (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2010</xref>). The transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) prevents many of the problems associated with oral and intravenous routes. Major advantages provided by TTS include improved bioavailability, more uniform plasma levels, longer duration of action resulting in less dosing frequency, reduced side effects, and improved therapy due to the maintenance of plasma levels (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b9000" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2014</xref>). Advances in modern technologies are resulting in a larger number of drugs being delivered transdermally including conventional hydrophobic small molecule drugs, hydrophilic drugs and macromolecules. There is no potential limit for the therapeutic area for the development of transdermal systems. A number of TTS for different drugs are now in the market including those for nicotine, clonidine, testosterone, oxybutinin, fentanyl, lidocaine and estradiol. The general acceptability of transdermal products by patients is very high, which is also evident from the increasing market for transdermal products. The transdermal market is estimated to represent today, worldwide, ca. $9.5 billion (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Hypertension is usually defined by the presence of a chronic elevation of systemic arterial pressure above a certain threshold value. This is a progressive cardiovascular syndrome arising from complex and interrelated etiologies. Progression is strongly associated with functional and structural cardiac and vascular abnormalities that damage the heart, kidneys, brain, vasculature, and other organs and lead to premature morbidity and death (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Giles et al., 2009</xref>). Global burden of disease study reported that there were 5.2 million deaths from cardiovascular diseases in economically developed countries and 9.1 million deaths from the same causes in developing countries (<xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Jain and Joshi, 2007</xref>). Worldwide prevalence estimates for hypertension may be as much as 1 billion individuals and approximately 7.1 million deaths per year may be attributable to hypertension (<xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">Kearney et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Chockalingam et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Alderman, 2007</xref>). Therefore cost effective approaches to optimally control blood pressure are very much needed (<xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">Selvam et al., 2010</xref>). There are many categories of antihypertensive agents, which lower blood pressure by different means; among the antihypertensive, most important and most widely used are the thiazide diuretics, &#946;-blockers, the ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, &#946;-blockers were listed as preferred first-line antihypertensive drugs along with diuretics in national hypertension guidelines. Subsequent updates of the guidelines favored diuretics as initial therapy and classified all other categories of antihypertensive medications to be alternatives to diuretics (<xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Moser, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Che et al., 2009</xref>). Although &#946;-blockers remain alternative first-line drugs in the latest guidelines (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>), they are the preferred antihypertensive agents for patients with cardiac disease. It is well established that &#946;-blockers are effective in treating patients with all grades of hypertension and because these drugs are potentiated by thiazide diuretics, it is general policy to use this combination in most patients with hypertension. Although the &#946;-blockers have many individual side effects, when compared to many other antihypertensive drugs, they are remarkably free of a number of troublesome side effects that have bedeviled the treatment of hypertension for many years. The drowsiness, lethargy, and nasal congestion so common with methyldopa, the interference with sexual function and postural hypotension frequently encountered with the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs, and the serious withdrawal phenomena found with clonidine are not frequent manifestations of &#946;-blocker therapy (<xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">O&#8217;Brien, 1978</xref>).</p><p>The shortcomings associated with conventional oral delivery of &#946;-blockers can be potentially minimized by novel drug delivery systems including transdermal dosage forms. However, so far none of the &#946;-blocker drugs have been marketed as transdermal delivery systems. Nevertheless, there have been noteworthy research endeavors worldwide at the laboratory level to investigate the skin permeation and to develop transdermal formulations of &#946;-blockers including: Propranolol (PP), Atenolol (AT), Metoprolol (MP), Bupranolol (BPL), Labetalol hydrochloride (LHCL), Carvedilol (CVD), Timolol maleate (TM) and Bisoprolol (BSP). Several studies have been investigated to develop transdermal systems of anti hypertensive drugs. Recently, Ahad et al., reviewed details of transdermal research specifically on calcium channel blockers for the management of hypertension (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2013a</xref>), while <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">G&#252;ng&#246;r and Ozsoy, 2012</xref> and Selvam et al. have done a brief overview on the different antihypertensive drugs delivered via skin in the literature (<xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">Selvam et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">G&#252;ng&#246;r and Ozsoy, 2012</xref>). Antecedently, Aqil et al. reviewed details of the studies focused on the transdermal delivery of &#946;-blockers (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>This review shows an outline of the transdermal research in the area of &#946;-blockers reported in various pharmaceutical journals. The advances and innovations in the transdermal delivery of &#946;-blockers for the management of hypertension are discussed in the text and a summary is presented in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Nonselective &#946;-blockers (&#946;1 and &#946;2)</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Propranolol</title><p>PP is a nonselective &#946;-adrenergic blocking agent. It inhibits response to adrenergic stimuli by competitively blocking &#946;-adrenergic receptors within the myocardium and within bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. It has been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and many other cardiovascular disorders. PP is subject to an extensive and highly variable hepatic first-pass metabolism following oral administration, with a reported systemic bioavailability of between 23% (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Dey et al., 2007</xref>). The peak plasma concentrations occur about 1&#8211;2&#160;h after an oral dose (80&#160;mg), but vary greatly between individuals. The biological half-life of propranolol is longer than would be anticipated from its plasma half-life of about 3&#8211;6&#160;h. It has a logarithm partition coefficient (log<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>) of 3.03 and short elimination half-life of about 3&#160;h (<xref rid="b0560" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and singh, 1999</xref>), which makes it a suitable candidate to be delivered transdermally at a controlled rate (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2011</xref>). The enhancement of hydrochloride salt of PP (PP&#8211;HCl) penetration by chemical and physical enhancers across the skin in vitro has been studied (<xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 1991</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2011</xref>, studied the effectiveness and mechanism(s) of percutaneous absorption of PP&#8211;HCl across rat and human cadaver skin using seven novel terpenes with reference to marker terpene 1,8-cineole (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2011</xref>). Terpenes are considered as safe absorption promoters and they have been categorized as generally safe by FDA (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Akhtar et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, they have ability to enhance the cutaneous permeation of lipophilic as well as hydrophilic actives (<xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2007b</xref>). Ahad et al., claimed that amongst the terpenes, 1,4-cineole was found to be most effective enhancer for diffusion of PP&#8211;HCl through rat skin (ER&#160;=&#160;3.07) and human cadaver skin (ER&#160;=&#160;2.42) as compared to control. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of skin treated with aforesaid terpenes indicated that permeation occurred due to the disruption of lipid bilayers. No apparent skin irritation (erythema, edema) was observed on treatment of skin with terpenes, the irritation was higher with the &#946;-citronellene and rose oxide. It was concluded that 1,4-cineole can be successfully used as potential permeation enhancer for PP&#8211;HCl (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Kunta et al., 1997</xref> investigated the effect of menthol, limonene, linalool and carvacrol on the percutaneous absorption of PP&#8211;HCl across hairless mouse skin. Authors concluded that alcohol terpenes are very effective in enhancing the transdermal transport of PP&#8211;HCl. In the case of linalool, the flux values increase 6 to 7-fold at 5&#8211;10% terpene concentration, whereas <sc>l</sc>-menthol provides a significant enhancement in percutaneous absorption at a concentration as low as 1%.</p><p>In another report, Zhao and Singh, investigated the mechanism(s) of percutaneous absorption enhancement of PP&#8211;HCl across porcine epidermis by terpenes (e.g. menthone and limonene) in combination with ethanol. Five percent menthone or limonene in combination with ethanol (menthone/ethanol or limonene/ethanol) significantly enhanced the flux of PP&#8211;HCl across porcine epidermis in comparison to ethanol (control). The partitioning of PP&#8211;HCl to the stratum corneum (SC) from the SC/enhancer system was also significantly greater than the SC/control system. It was observed that the above terpenes showed a decrease in the peak heights and areas for both asymmetric and symmetric C&#8212;H stretching absorbance in comparison with the untreated SC, indicating the SC lipids extraction. Thus, an enhancement in the flux of PP&#8211;HCl by menthone/ethanol and limonene/ethanol is due to SC lipid extraction, macroscopic barrier perturbation, and improvement in the partitioning of the drug to the SC (<xref rid="b0560" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and singh, 1999</xref>). Similar mechanism of action was also reported for the terpenes such as (+)-borneol, (+)-camphor, and &#945;-bisabolol (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2011</xref>). It was described in the study that each of (+)-borneol, (+)-camphor, and &#945;-bisabolol significantly increased the transdermal flux of PP&#8211;HCl through rat skin in comparison to the control. The enhancement mechanism of the terpenes is involved with disruption of the lipid bilayer and increases the PP&#8211;HCl partitioning coefficient to the SC (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In 2005, Amnuaikit et al., developed film formulations of PP&#8211;HCl containing menthol, cineole and propylene glycol as enhancers for transdermal use. In vitro skin permeation study presented that cineole was found to be the most promising terpene among the investigated enhancers which provided high skin permeation rates (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Amnuaikit et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is reported in the literature that a variety of chemical permeation enhancers have been shown to increase percutaneous absorption of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (<xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Barry, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et al., 2010</xref>). In this regard, a comparative study (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 1992</xref>) was done for the percutaneous enhancement of a hydrophilic (PP&#8211;HCl) and a lipophilic drug (diazepam or indomethacin) by various enhancers such as 1-nonanone, 1-nonalol and 1-decanol. It was found that 1-nonalol and 1-decanol significantly enhance the PP&#8211;HCl flux, whereas the indomethacin or diazepam flux is enhanced by 1-nonanone only. A rise in PP&#8211;HCl flux by terpenes is reported to be comparable to that observed with 1-nonalol (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 1992</xref>). The prodrug approach has also been employed to enhance the transdermal delivery of PP (<xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Namdeo and Jain, 2002</xref>). An increase in PP&#8211;HCl flux as high as 20- and 25-fold can be achieved from two PP prodrugs namely hydrochloride salts of PP stearate and PP palmitate respectively. Transdermal administration of these prodrugs improves the bioavailability of PP&#8211;HCl up to 7&#8211;8 times over the oral treatment.</p><p>Skin microdialysis is another technique which permits to measure the kinetics of drug appearance in the dermis under the site of application of drugs in vivo and in humans (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Groth, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, skin microdialysis technique was employed to characterize and quantify the dermatopharmacokinetics of iontophoretically delivered PP&#8211;HCl in the dermis of healthy human volunteers. Microdialysis probes were inserted in the subject&#8217;s forearm skin and an iontophoresis device was installed above them. Constant current was applied for two periods of 1&#160;h each separated by a 1&#160;h interval. Dialysate samples were collected every 6&#160;min for 4.4&#160;h and analyzed. It was observed that the skin microdialysis technique was well tolerated and this study demonstrates that intradermal microdialysis is suitable to examine the dermato pharmacokinetics of iontophoretically delivered drugs in the dermis of human subjects. Elimination was well characterized. Quantification of the absorption process by AUC showed a high inter- and intra-subject variability suggesting that more studies are needed to understand whether such variability is due to variation in microdialysis recovery, in iontophoretic delivery, or in dermis clearance (<xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">Stagni et al., 2000</xref>). In another study, the antihypertensive activity and pharmacokinetic performance of PP&#8211;HCl in rabbits following transdermal administration was compared with that of oral administration. In contrast to oral delivery, a sustained therapeutic activity was observed over a period of 24&#160;h after transdermal administration and 5 to 6-fold increase in relative bioavailability of PP&#8211;HCl was observed after transdermal administration in comparison to oral administration. This may be due to the avoidance of first pass effect of PP&#8211;HCl and the sustained therapeutic activity was due to the controlled release of drug into systemic circulation following transdermal administration (<xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2003</xref>). In 2000, Verma and Iyer also reported slow and controlled release of PP&#8211;HCl from polymeric matrix type transdermal films prepared with different grades and ratios of Eudragit (E) (<xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Iyer, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In another study, polymeric films containing PP&#8211;HCl were formulated using different ratios of ethyl cellulose (EC), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) by mercury substrate method. It was observed that the release rate of PP&#8211;HCl increased linearly with increasing drug concentration and PVP fraction in the film, but was found to be independent of film thickness. The increase in release rate may be due to leaching of hydrophilic fraction of the film former, which resulted in the formation of pores. It was also observed that the release of PP&#8211;HCl from the films followed the diffusion-controlled model at low drug concentration. A burst effect was observed initially, however, at high drug loading level, which may be due to rapid dissolution of the surface drug followed by the diffusion of the drug through the polymer network in the film. The transdermal flux values were also added with increase of initial drug concentration in the film, and also with the PVP content. It was suggested that prepared film should be selected for the development of TTS using a suitable adhesive layer and backing membrane for potential therapeutic applications (<xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2000</xref>). In another report, release of PP&#8211;HCl from hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) matrices without adhesive coating was found to be fast. Release from these matrices became more regular (reduction of the burst effect) and slow when they are coated with a 12&#160;mm thick Ucecryl layer. Release from different polyisobutylene matrices was found too slow to be suitable as TTS for PP&#8211;HCl. Amongst the investigated polymers the best release modulation was obtained from Ucecryl matrices (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Guyot and Fawaz, 2000</xref>). In another investigation, formulations with the highest proportion of PVP shows faster release of PP&#8211;HCl over a day&#8217;s span whereas increasing the proportion of EC produces a prolonged regimen of sustained drug delivery through the transdermal route for a period of more than a day. It was demonstrated that the fabricated matrix films have the potential to prolong the release of PP&#8211;HCl (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Dey et al., 2007</xref>). The PP&#8211;HCl release was regulated by the use of cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde in transdermal membrane prepared by chitosan a natural polymer. Chitosan gel was used as the drug reservoir. The ability of these devices to deliver the drug while supported on rabbit pinna skin was tested by conducting in vitro studies in modified Franz diffusion cells. The drug release profiles showed that the PP&#8211;HCl delivery is completely controlled by the devices. The rate of PP&#8211;HCl release was found to be dependent on the type of membrane used. It has been proved that natural polymer chitosan can be used successfully for the fabrication of transdermal devices. The drug release can be easily tailored by changing the permeability of the membrane by chemical modifications, like cross-linking or by changing the area of the devices. With the usage of natural polymers such as chitosan for the fabrication of TTS, most of the device-associated adverse skin reactions can be minimized (<xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">Thacharodi and Rao, 1995</xref>). Rate of PP&#8211;HCl release from the pH-controlled, water-activated reservoir devices was also controlled over a 700-fold range by using suitable buffers in the device core (<xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">Sutinen et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">Sutinen et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">Sutinen et al., 2000a</xref>).</p><p>In another investigation, reservoir-type transdermal enantioselective-controlled delivery system for racemic PP&#8211;HCl using a molecularly imprinted polymer composite membrane was examined.

The reservoir patch for enantiomer-controlled delivery of PP&#8211;HCl was therefore fabricated by incorporating the chitosan gel formulation containing racemic PP&#8211;HCl into the molecularly imprinted polymer composite membrane laminated backing. These patch devices were shown to exhibit the significant stereoselectivity uptake of PP&#8211;HCl.

Elastic liposomes differ from conventional niosomes and liposomes by their characteristic fluid membrane with high elasticity (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2013b</xref>). The elasticity of these vesicles is attributed to the simultaneous presence of different stabilizing (phospholipids) and destabilizing (surfactant) molecules and their tendency to redistribute in bilayers. Such highly deformable vesicles can thus be used to bring drugs across biological permeability barriers such as the skin. Elastic liposomes were prepared by <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2007</xref> for enhanced PP&#8211;HCl transdermal delivery. Elastic liposomes loaded with PP&#8211;HCl were prepared by conventional rotary evaporation method. It was observed that the elastic liposome of PP&#8211;HCl provides better transdermal flux, higher entrapment efficiency, ability as a self-penetration enhancer and effectiveness of transdermal delivery as compared to traditional liposomes (<xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>). The lower penetration ability that is associated with the use of vesicular carriers such as liposomes and niosomes can be overcome by entrapment of the drugs in the elastic liposomes.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Timolol</title><p>TM is a hydrophilic potent &#946;-adrenoceptor blocking agent that is used to treat hypertension, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction.

The key to achieve long-acting effects for transdermal patches is to control the drug skin-permeating rate in a moderate range, that is, neither too high and leading to a relatively high blood concentration nor too low to obtain the therapeutic effect. To date, the most common strategies of controlling flux include the use of release controlling membranes and suitable adhesive matrixes. In this aspect, recently a novel simple method of controlling BSP flux by ion-pair was initiated. Different ion-pair complexes including BSP-maleate, BSP-tartarate, BSP-besilate, and BSP-fumarate were prepared and their fluxes through rabbit abdominal skin were determined separately in vitro. It was observed that compared to free BSP, all BSP ion-pair complexes displayed lower and controllable flux.

While in another study, azone was used to enhance transdermal flux of BSP (used as fumarate salt) and about 98.3% BSP release was observed across the transdermal patch prepared using PVP, PVA (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Dinakar et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The combination therapy of nitrate and selective &#946;-adrenoceptor antagonist has shown benefits for the treatment of hypertension and heart disease than either drug alone. In this aspect, the blood pressure lowering effect and pharmacokinetics of a novel transdermal patch incorporating isosorbide dinitrate with BSP were investigated (<xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). The in vitro transdermal penetration of both isosorbide dinitrate and BSP from the patches showed a zero-order process. After transdermal administration at single dose or multiple doses, the synergistic blood pressure lowering effect was confirmed in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effect of each patch lasts for 3&#160;days, and increased with the total dose of two drugs, showing a dose dependant manner. After transdermal administration in rabbits, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> of both drugs was significantly reduced while the areas under the plasma concentration&#8211;time curve, and mean residence times were evidently increased and extended, respectively. As a patient-friendly, convenient, and multi-day dosing therapeutic system, the transdermal patches incorporating isosorbide dinitrate and BSP could be promising for the prevention and treatment of hypertension (<xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>4</label><title>Mixed &#946;-blockers (has additional &#945;-blocking activity)</title><sec id="s0055"><label>4.1</label><title>Carvedilol</title><p>CVD is a non-selective &#946;-blocker. It blocks &#946;-1 and &#946;-2 adrenergic receptors as well as the &#945;-1 adrenergic receptors. It is the most widely prescribed drug in the long term treatment of hypertension. It is clinically indicated not only in the management of hypertension, but for myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure too. CVD is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, despite being well-absorbed, its oral bioavailability in human is about 20%, due to a significant degree of first-pass metabolism. CVD has a low molecular weight (406.5), a favorable log<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> (4.115), with a short plasma half-life of 6&#160;h (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0535" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Long term therapy of hypertension by CVD oral administration may result in poor patient compliance because of low oral bioavailability in humans, leading to increased frequency of administration (<xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Morgan, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Hokama et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CVD was found to be a good drug candidate for developing a transdermal system because of its physicochemical profile.</p><p><xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">Ubaidulla et al., 2007</xref> developed a matrix-type&#160;TTS containing CVD with different ratios of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymeric combinations such as (a) EC and PVP, and (b) E-RL100 and E-RS100 by the solvent evaporation technique. The bioavailability studies in rats indicated that the CVD transdermal&#160;patches provided steady-state plasma concentrations with minimal fluctuations and improved bioavailability in comparison with oral&#160;administration. The antihypertensive activity of the patches in comparison with that of oral CVD revealed that the patches significantly controlled the hypertension in methyl prednisolone acetate-induced hypertensive rats (<xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">Ubaidulla et al., 2007</xref>). Monolithic matrix-type TTS for CVD were prepared using a film casting technique involving different ratios and combination of HPMC, HPC, E-RS100 and E-RL100 as matrix-forming polymers. All formulations carried 8% v/w of d-limonene as a penetration enhancer and 20% v/w of dibutyl phthalate as a plasticizer. Formulation F5 (4:1 ratio of HPMC, E-RL100) showed both maximum drug release (12.31&#160;mg) and permeation (2987.67&#160;&#956;g/cm<sup>2</sup>) in 24&#160;h, which differed significantly among all the formulations. Formulation F5 showed maximum flux (32.80&#160;&#956;g/h/cm<sup>2</sup>), which meets the flux requirements, and differed significantly among all the formulations. A shelf life of 2&#160;years was predicted for the prepared TTS. The authors claimed that, monolithic matrix-type CVD-TTS could be prepared having both the required flux and suitable mechanical properties by using aforesaid polymer (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Gannu et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><p>Recently, matrix-type transdermal patch of CVD was developed using different ratios of polymer combinations by solvent evaporation technique. It was observed that the molded patch followed Higuchi kinetics release pattern and the mechanism of release was found to be diffusion mediated. The pharmacokinetic studies of optimized transdermal CVD patches on rats revealed improved bioavailability of 72% in comparison to oral administration with steady-state plasma concentration. In addition optimized patch shows transdermal flux of 30.08&#160;&#956;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/h which was more as compared to plain CVD, further pharmacodynamic activity of the optimized transdermal CVD patch showed significant controlled hypertension as compared to the control group (<xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Kshirsagar et al., 2012</xref>). In another study, the patches containing glycyrrhizin&#8211;chitosan mixture was also found to be able to control hypertension in experimental hypertensive rats (<xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">Sapra et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, the influence of glycyrrhizin and chitosan on the permeation of CVD via rat epidermis was evaluated. The permeation of CVD across excised rat epidermis was found significantly higher when glycyrrhizin, chitosan, or glycyrrhizin&#8211;chitosan mixture was used as a donor vehicle as compared to propylene glycol:ethanol (7:3) mixture. In addition, developed patches containing glycyrrhizin&#8211;chitosan mixture showed sustained release of CVD, which was able to control the hypertension in experimental hypertensive rats. Rat epidermis microconstituents determination exhibit maximum extraction of cholesterol, sphingosine, and triglycerides after treatment with glycyrrhizin&#8211;chitosan mixture. Further, increase in intercellular space, disordered lipid structure and corneocyte detachment as observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggests great potential of glycyrrhizin for use as a transdermal permeation enhancer (<xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">Sapra et al., 2008</xref>), while extraction of lipids from SC as well as loosening of hydrogen bonds between ceramides as the mechanism of enhancement of CVD by black cumin oil was reported elsewhere (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Amin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In another report, a significant improvement in the bioavailability of CVD was observed with the transdermal patches over oral tablets. In this study, the bioavailability of two drugs viz. CVD and hydrochlorothiazide from a TTS with conventional immediate release oral tablets in healthy volunteers was observed. The developed TTS produced therapeutically effective plasma concentrations of the CVD and hydrochlorothiazide up to a range of 60&#8211;72&#160;h. In conclusion, the developed TTS conforms to the aim of at least 2&#160;day management of stage II hypertension with the application of a single transdermal patch and hence improving patient compliance (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal and Aggarwal, 2010</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Sapra et al., 2009a</xref>, investigated the effect of soybean extract and chitosan in facilitating the permeation of CVD across the rat epidermis. The antihypertensive activity of the patches in comparison to that after oral administration of CVD was studied in deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertensive rats. The in vitro permeation of CVD across rat epidermis increased and was maximum with a combination of soybean extract and chitosan. Furthermore, the application of patches containing soybean extract and chitosan mixture resulted in sustained release of CVD, which was able to control the blood pressure in hypertensive rats through 24&#160;h (<xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Sapra et al., 2009a</xref>). In another report, the effect of <italic toggle="yes">Asparagus racemosus</italic> extract and chitosan in facilitating the permeation of CVD across rat epidermis was also observed by <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Sapra et al., 2009b</xref>.

Transdermal permeation of CVD through the rat skin was determined using the Keshary&#8211;Chien diffusion cell. Authors claimed that there was a significant increase in the steady state flux and permeability coefficient in nanoemulsion formulations as compared to the control. The highest value of these permeability parameters was obtained in optimized formulation B3 (CVD (0.5% w/w), OA (6% w/w): isopropyl myristate (1:1), Tween 80 (22.5% w/w), Transcutol-P (22.5% w/w) and distilled water. It was suggested that the prepared formulation was found to be devoid of any skin irritation potential.</p><p>Consequently, in 2010, Rizwan et al. prepared nanoemulsion or enhanced transdermal delivery of CVD. It was observed that prepared nanoemulsions showed a high skin permeation rate (92.251&#8211;161.53&#160;&#956;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/h), good enhancement ratio (ER) of 3.5&#8211;6.2 and high permeability coefficient in comparison to control. The optimised nanoemulsion formulation consisted of 0.25% w/w CVD, 12.5% w/w Miglyol 810&#174;, 50% w/w Acconon CC6&#174;/CO-20&#174; (1:1) and water. The above formulation had the smallest mean globule size of 9.28&#160;nm. The authors claimed that superior transdermal flux of CVD may be due to nano range size of oil globules that lead to intimate contact with the skin layer. It was suggested that the developed nanoemulsion system is a promising vehicle for the transdermal delivery of CVD (<xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Rizwan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In another report, the effect of vehicles (labrasol, transcutol, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, ethanol, OA, and isopropyl myristate) and selected penetration enhancers such as limonene, carvone, camphor, menthol, transcutol, and labrasol at 5% w/v concentrations was investigated on the in vitro permeation of CVD from saturated solutions across porcine skin. Phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 40% v/v polyethylene glycol 400 was served as the control. It was observed that the transdermal flux of CVD from transcutol, labrasol, polyethylene glycol 400, ethanol, and OA was 10.5, 8.6, 4.2, 2.9, and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than that of the control. The flux obtained using transcutol was significantly higher than the flux obtained using the other vehicles. Solutions containing camphor (5% w/v) showed maximum permeation in 24&#160;h with a flux of 3.19&#160;&#956;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/h, which was significantly different than the flux obtained using other permeation enhancers. The flux of CVD from the solutions containing 5% w/v camphor, limonene, transcutol, carvone, labrasol, and menthol were 9.7, 7.6, 7.6, 6.3, 4.7, and 2.3 times higher, respectively, than the control. The authors claimed that transcutol, labrasol, and polyethylene glycol 400 may be used as potential vehicles and camphor, limonene, and transcutol at a 5% w/v level as penetration enhancers can be used for enhanced transdermal delivery of CVD (<xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Gannu et al., 2008b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>4.2</label><title>Labetalol</title><p>LHCL is a nonselective blocker of adrenergic receptors. It binds competitively with both &#945;- and &#946;-receptors. It is slightly soluble in water and is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. LHCL is rapidly absorbed following an oral dose but undergoes extensive first pass metabolism, resulting in only 25% oral bioavailability (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">MacCarthy and Bloomfield, 1983</xref>). The drug is eliminated rapidly, so repeated daily administration is required to maintain effective plasma levels. The half-life of LHCL is approximately 4&#8211;6&#160;h. It has a low molecular weight (364.9) and favorable log<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> (1.89), with no reported skin irritation history. All these factors suggest that LHCL is an ideal drug candidate for the development of a TTS (<xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">Zafar et al., 2010</xref>). However, fewer reports were found in the literature on the transdermal delivery of this drug. In 2005, Aqil et al., used E-RL100, E-RS100 and PVP K-30 as the film-forming polymers for the preparation of matrix-type TTS of LHCL along with polyethylene glycol-400 as the plasticizer and DMSO as the penetration enhancer (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2005</xref>). The authors claimed a high release &gt;90% of LHCL from the TTS, which is therapeutically effective in experimental hypertensive rats. In another report, <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">Zafar et al., 2010</xref> investigated the effect of different penetration enhancers namely turpentine oil, dimethyl formamide, menthol, DMSO, pine oil, and 2-pyrollidone for LHCL transdermal delivery. Amongst the investigated enhancers, DMSO (10% v/v) was found to be the most effective enhancer for LHCL. It was observed that on increasing the concentration of drug and enhancer in the donor cell the permeability coefficient of LHCL was also accentuated. It was concluded that LHCL could be delivered via the dermal route with the use of 10% DMSO as the penetration enhancer (<xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">Zafar et al., 2010</xref>). The effect of basil oil, a volatile oil containing alcoholic terpenes, as a potential penetration enhancer for improved skin permeation of LHCL with reference to camphor, geraniol, thymol, and clove oil was also studied (<xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2008</xref>). In vitro permeation of LHCL in vehicle per se and in the presence of 5% w/v enhancer was investigated by performing in vitro rat abdominal skin permeation studies using a side-by-side glass diffusion cell. Among all enhancers, basil oil produced the maximum enhancement (ER&#160;=&#160;46.52) over neat vehicle. Activation energies for LHCL permeation in water, vehicle per se and in the presence of 5% w/v basil oil were found to be 23.16, 18.71, and 10.98&#160;kcal/mol, respectively. Lowering of activation energy in the presence of basil oil suggests the creation of new polar pathways in the skin for enhanced permeation of LHCL. It was concluded that basil oil was found to be a promising transdermal permeation enhancer for improved LHCL transdermal drug delivery. In another report, a matrix type TTS containing combinations of E-EPO/E-RL100 and Plasdone S630 as polymers was investigated for enhanced transdermal delivery of LHCL (<xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Mittal et al., 2009</xref>). The optimized formulation was also assessed for its pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, skin irritation potential, and stability studies. The authors claimed 92.43% and 76.24% drug release and permeation respectively in 48&#160;h from the optimized patch formulation. The developed optimized patch showed sustained action and was seemingly free of skin irritation potential as suggested by the skin Draize score test. It was reported that the above transdermal system holds promise for improved bioavailability and better management of hypertension on a long term basis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hypertension is an important predictor of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents and death. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension is rapidly increasing in developing countries. There are many categories of antihypertensives, amongst which &#946;-blockers are a very important class. Most &#946;-blockers exhibit low bio availability due to hepatic first-pass metabolism following oral administration. They are required to be taken more than once a day due to their short half-lives. For this reason, their administration more than once a day with the conventional oral dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, results in poor patient compliance. Also, fluctuations in the plasma drug concentrations are observed over the dosing intervals. There is a need to improve drug delivery devices for &#946;-blockers because of the quantum of their utilization and short comings associated with their conventional dosage forms. Transdermal drug delivery systems are one of the most rapidly advancing areas of novel drug delivery, which are designed to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of drug across a patient&#8217;s skin. In addition, transdermal delivery provides many advantages like avoidance of the first-pass effect, sustained therapeutic action and improved patient compliance (<xref rid="b9000" ref-type="bibr">Ahad et al., 2014</xref>). As we can see from this review article, a brief overview of the different &#946;-blockers revealed that, delivering through the transdermal route improves bioavailability as well as improves patient compliance by many fold. Further work is needed to allow the &#946;-blockers for transdermal systems and refine it in order to attain suitable clinical levels in patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Agrawal</surname><given-names>S.S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Aggarwal</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Randomised, cross-over, comparative bioavailability trial of matrix type transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) of carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide combination in healthy human volunteers: a pilot study</article-title><source>Contemp.
