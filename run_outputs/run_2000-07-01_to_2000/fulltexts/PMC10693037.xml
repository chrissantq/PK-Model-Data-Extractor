Because of the unprecedented nature of a potential treatment and the high-risk and low incidence of occurrence, translation to the human condition is a complex task. Consequently, the obstetric procedure, the act of transferring the infant from the pregnant woman to the APAW system, has not yet been established for human patients. The use of simulation-based user-centered development allows for a safe environment in which protocols and devices can be conceptualized and tested.

To support growth and development, newborns are placed in warmed incubators with respiratory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fetal and neonatal scientific community continues to research a range of treatments for extreme preterm birth to ensure better outcomes for these infants. Recently, Artificial Placenta (AP) and Artificial Womb (AW), or (APAW) technology are being studied as an alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. APAW is an extra-uterine life support system that simulates the liquid environment of the native womb while also supplying oxygen to the perinate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multiple animal experiments have successfully maintained fetal lambs for up to 28 days on artificial placenta support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], bringing the technology closer to clinical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The innovative cardiovascular intervention, oxygenators, umbilical cord cannulation, and liquid environment design to prevent sepsis were the focus of these studies. For a patient, the first step of such a treatment would entail the infant&#8217;s birth and the subsequent transfer from the native womb into the artificial womb. In previous animal studies, this entailed a cesarean section (CS) which typically was performed under general anesthesia, thereby consequently suppressing the breathing reflex. Lung aeration may trigger the fetal to neonatal cardiovascular transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and would make the use of APAW unsuitable as the aim is to supply oxygen-rich blood via the umbilical cord, not the lungs, to maintain a fetal physiological state. An investigation into the obstetric procedure has not been described thus far. Such an unprecedented CS and vaginal birth (VB) procedure demands new protocols, new collaborations, adaptability to the new socio-technical environment, and perhaps even new disciplines to join the operating room. In this study, we employ a simulation-based development method to form an understanding of the considerations related to various obstetric practices. Through this methodology, we gain and integrate perspectives from different stakeholders in the early design phase of suitable obstetric protocols for a simulated transfer by CS and VB.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Simulation</title><p id="Par13">Animal models have helped advance scientific fields including obstetrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and premature birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Much of our knowledge regarding APAW technology stems from studies conducted on animals, contributing predominantly and being essential to the advancement of this field. Pre-clinical studies have been used to evaluate APAW systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but further investigation into certain topics is appropriate before moving to human translation with a fully developed system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Animal research and laboratory data may not match clinical outcomes. This translation adds new challenges and requirements that need to be identified and addressed. These include the careful consideration of ethical issues for human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The unpredictable nature of premature births, the critical high-risk therapeutic uncertainties, the emotional load on patients&#8217; families and clinical staff, and low patient recruitment for a first-in-human study, make regular clinical studies difficult to achieve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">To approximate the human patient and allow for improvement of the procedure, protocol, and system before performing human trials, one can choose from a range of methods including using human tissue, synthetic tissue, human cadavers, inanimate models, interactive human patient simulators and virtual/augmented reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A promising alternative to successfully develop life-support technologies, distill user insights, and improve quality of care can be found in the creation of a high-fidelity medical simulation.

To form an understanding of the requirements of a transfer procedure for human patients and assess clinical acceptance, APAW research should collaborate with various stakeholders. These include parents, medical experts (such as nurses, obstetricians, perinatologists, fetal surgeons, and neonatologists), medical engineers, and potentially new specialists essential for performing this treatment. Frequent stakeholder involvement may improve safety (including human error reduction), effectiveness, and user satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

General anesthesia is typically avoided in standard cesarean sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and is used only during emergencies or medical necessity (e.g., umbilical cord prolapse, low platelets) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. During human fetal surgeries, such as ex-utero intrapartum treatment, general anesthesia is also used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Despite this, 6 of 7 participants in phase IV (P36&#8211;P41) favored general anesthesia over spinal anesthesia, citing benefits such as fetal respiration suppression, uterine relaxation, and reduced time pressure to perform the transfer. A drawback was mentioned (P42)&#8212;the potential negative impact on maternal mental well-being, affecting the conscious delivery experience and parent-infant bonding. &#8220;I think especially from a psychological point of view and the bonding process and the totally different approach, that it is good that the mother and the partner are there consciously experiencing that. Therefore, I think from this point of view general anesthesia has no place. Not so much because of a medical reason, but for psychological reasons I would not recommend general anesthesia.&#8221;</p><p id="Par32">Fetal hemodynamic instability emerged as another concern due to suboptimal autoregulation, particularly in premature fetuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Anesthetics and opiates can trigger significant fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Additionally, general anesthesia entails maternal risks such as intubation and ventilation complications, aspiration pneumonia, and higher blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Despite its use in APAW animal experiments, the duration and extent of fetal respiration suppression under general anesthesia for human transfers remain uncertain, according to participants (P39, P41). While epidural analgesia is not standard for vaginal premature deliveries, interviewees (P21, P22) highlighted its potential utility in alleviating device-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Considering all data and expert insights, a proposed approach (P36) suggests starting with general anesthesia for initial clinical transfers, potentially transitioning to spinal anesthesia as experience grows. To prevent ductus arteriosus closure, participants (P9&#8211;P16) recommended prostaglandin administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Uterine relaxants</title><p id="Par34">During the cannulation of the umbilical vessels, the blood supply from the native placenta to the fetus should be preserved as steady as possible. Therefore, preventing immediate placental detachment is critical. Reduced uterine contractions also aid in easier wound retractor insertion and fetal transfer into the bag. Expert interviews explored uterine relaxation solutions. While placental detachment was not expected in a short timeframe, optimizing all aspects during transfer was deemed important by one participant (P36). The mentioned medications for uterine relaxation included sevoflurane, nitroglycerin, pethidine, and ritodrine (P17, P18, P36, P37). Although uterine relaxation medication might be used, postpartum hemorrhage was not regarded as a large risk, and therefore interviewees (P36&#8211;P42) generally discouraged maternal arterial line use, except for rare conditions such as coagulation disorders (P37, P39, P40).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Maternal blood loss</title><p id="Par35">General anesthesia and/or uterine relaxants may lead to increased blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. To mitigate maternal blood loss, post-procedure uterine contraction is essential. Medications such as oxytocin, methylergometrine, sulprostone, and other prostaglandins can aid (P36&#8211;P38). Participant input (P38) also noted non-pharmacological interventions such as uterine massage, B-lynch, and uterine balloon tamponade as considerations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Rupture of the membranes</title><p id="Par36">Preterm births stem from various causes; fetal membranes may rupture prematurely PPROM prior to surgery, exposing the fetus to infection risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Exploring whether a brief absence of amniotic fluid alone could trigger fetal-neonatal physiological transition requires further investigation. Thus, eligible patient criteria might need refinement. In vaginal delivery transfers, membrane rupture can be induced shortly prior to the procedure via an amniotomy hook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. An option is rupturing membranes just before device insertion, sealing around the cervix. When cervical dilation reaches approximately 6 cm or the fetal head diameter permits cervix passage (P9, P12), the liquid environment in which the infant is brought must be ready and near/attached to the mother.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Fetal environmental exposure</title><p id="Par37">While it is intended that during the transfer the fetus stays fully immersed in liquid, there is a chance of the fetal body not being completely or continuously submerged in AAF. Instances include umbilical cord cannulation and brief head exposure during uterine incision to transferbag attachment. Experts noted that these brief exposures, lasting seconds, are generally acceptable. However, attention must be given to premature infants&#8217; rapid cooling (seconds to half a minute) triggering respiration and heightened infection risk upon skin contact with the exterior (P39&#8211;P42) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The fragility of the skin heightens the risk of skin tears (P42) and infections (P38&#8211;P40) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>AAF flow into the uterus</title><p id="Par38">During interviews and simulations, concerns were raised about AAF flowing from the pre-filled transferbag into the uterus, especially during cesarean sections, a concern confirmed by a liquid-based simulation. However, interviewees (P36&#8211;P42) generally view AAF entering the uterus as not problematic as it is a sterile fluid, and the uterus will not be filled under pressure. Mimicking the native amniotic fluid composition of water and electrolytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], complications such as transurethral resection syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] are not anticipated. After disconnecting the transferbag, AAF can be suctioned from the uterus, with uterine contractions aiding remaining fluid expulsion (P36, P37). One participant (P37) mentioned &#8220;I do not think the uterus will be three times its size because of this transfer. When you have delivered the baby and disconnected the transferbag, you [&#8230;] only have to make sure to suction the amniotic fluid. After the procedure it will flow away [through the cervix]. Therefore, I do not think it will be a big problem&#8221;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Maternal positioning</title><p id="Par39">Theoretically, a standard CS maternal position involves a 15&#176; left lateral tilt to avoid vena cava and aortic compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], averting hypotension. However, a 15&#176; tilt is seldom achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] (P40). The CS transfer procedure demands optimal maternal positioning for a near-horizontal pathway from the uterus to the transferbag. When the bag is upright and filled with AAF, fluid directly flows into the uterus. Proposals of a 30&#176; left lateral tilt met reservations due to maternal instability and surgical access challenges, although some deemed it feasible under general anesthesia and proper practice (P41). Another suggestion proposed (P40) was to perform a temporary side turn at the moment that everything for the transfer of the perinate into the transferbag would be in place, i.e., just for a couple of minutes. Liquid-based simulations (phase V) verified that left lateral tilt and subsequent side tilting enabled a horizontal transferbag position, preventing excessive AAF influx to the uterus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Monitoring fetal vital functions</title><p id="Par40">In a standard CS, the incision-to-delivery time is roughly 5 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Fetal vital functions are usually not monitored during this phase. Considering the longer duration and increased risks of the transfer procedure, fetal vital monitoring might be appropriate. Perinatologists interviewed (P36&#8211;P38) did not consider monitoring of vital functions necessary during the transfer. However, it was mentioned to be interesting from a scientific point of view, to be able to predict the prognostics more accurately. Anesthesiologists (P40, P41) stressed monitoring fetal heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Nevertheless, priority was given to a smooth, swift transfer due to the potential invasiveness and time consumption of monitoring methods.</p><p id="Par41">Neonatologists (P39, P42) expressed interest in heart rate information during the transfer, while blood pressure and saturation were considered optional. Heart rate could serve as a threshold for initiating a rescue procedure in cases of prolonged bradycardia. Monitoring fetal heart rate aids decisions on continuing, pausing, or halting the transfer.</p><p id="Par42">Participants suggested various monitoring methods: umbilical cord ultrasound Doppler (P39, P41), continuous abdominal ultrasound during CS (P37), abdominal ultrasound through the transferbag (P40, P42), and continuous cardiotocography during vaginal birth transfer (P6, P9&#8211;P16). Non-invasive cerebral hemodynamics via TD-NIRS was noted as promising for monitoring when the infant is in the transferbag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Hygiene</title><p id="Par43">Prior APAW studies were hampered by sepsis development, partly due to fluid contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For standard CS delivery, a sterile environment is crucial: operating under filtered air ventilation, with protective measures such as gloves and cover-ups. Interviewees believed this setup would preserve hygiene during transfers. While neonatologists typically are not in sterile outfits, their increased role, particularly in cannulation, suggests placing one sterile surgical attire post-transfer to minimize contamination (P39, P42). For vaginal delivery, extra hygiene measures are needed due to AAF contact with the vaginal microbiome. While not all studies support it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], intrapartum intravaginal lavage could reduce infant infection risk from maternal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Some participants cautioned against vaginal lavage due to premature infant skin sensitivity (P21, P22), preferring non-iodine solutions (P21, P22). A physical barrier between the birth canal and perinate, coated with sterile agents, was also suggested (P17). During transfer, maternal amniotic fluid mixing with AAF might necessitate circulating AAF flow in the transferbag. Current APAW systems refresh AAF continuously to reduce microbial accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Participants recommended administration of antibiotics to further lower infection risk (P9, P12, P16, P39, P42).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Cannulation and establishment of circulation</title><p id="Par44">Umbilical cord length averages about 40 centimeters at 24 weeks of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Hence, if umbilical cord cannulation is performed, it must be done near the mother due to cord length constraints. Simulations (phases III and V) highlighted the need for the infant to stay close to the incision site post-delivery. Preserving adequate native cord length has been shown to be beneficial for improved cannula stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The duration of the cannulation was also mentioned (P42): &#8220;Safety requirements must be added [to the protocol]; how long can it take? If the cannulation lasts longer than X seconds, you must decide to convert to standard care&#8221;. In addition to performing the cannulation after the infant has been transferred into a transferbag, there is also the possibility of cannulation while the infant is still intrauterine (resembling the ex-utero intrapartum treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Distribution of tasks and positioning of clinicians</title><p id="Par45">Simulations (phases III and V) informed efficient task allocation and participant positioning around the operating table. Initial simulations involved two participants on each side (phase III). Simulations revealed tacit knowledge and guided discussions on dexterity, optimal sight, workload division, and transferbag handling, resulting in iterative refinements. During the simulations, it appeared the most optimal to have four persons involved in the transfer: a perinatologist and surgical assistant on either side of the operating table. The surgical assistants supported the perinatologists on corresponding sides. The perinatologist on the left side made the incisions (due to the left lateral tilt), and delivered the perinate in the transferbag, while the perinatologist on the right side inserted the retractors from the transfer tool. At the time of delivery, the staff on the right turned the mother on her side. Post-procedure, the right and left sides were split up into two teams. With the left side being responsible for the perinate and communicating with neonatologists, aid in the umbilical cord cannulation, and the right side oversaw maternal after care, delivered the placenta, and sutured the incisions (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The first checkpoint is thought to be of importance because of the additional, novel, equipment which might need more explanation and attention (P37). Additionally, the second checkpoint is at a crucial stage, &#8220;At the moment the child is in the transferbag, you have to look really carefully; is the situation of the child still good?&#8221; (P39).

These phases would include (1) preparation, (2) transfer, and (3) cannulation and placement in the APAW system. Within the current study, only the preparation, transfer phases, and the involvement of the first team were simulated. The first team monitors the mother and fetus. The second team handles cord cannulation and perinate stabilization. The third team places the perinate in the APAW system.</p><p id="Par50">The estimated personnel for a full CS transfer procedure are eleven medical staff members with specific expertise (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As this would be logistically and economically challenging, further research is required to understand the feasibility and determine whether this is an ideal setup in practice. Similarly, for a transfer procedure after vaginal birth, the same teams are needed, yet the number of team members may be reduced to eight staff members: two perinatologists, an obstetrics nurse, an anesthesiologist with an assistant, a neonatologist with an assistant, and a technical physician.</p><p id="Par51">We propose to enable two transfer procedures depending on the delivery type: vaginal (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and CS (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Although vaginal birth is the dominant procedure for the delivery of premature infants delivery globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], several considerations led us to develop a protocol for two delivery modes. A CS delivery cannot always be replaced by a vaginal delivery and vice versa. Excluding vaginal delivery in advance limits the application and could force many women to have a CS that otherwise would not have occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, in current practice, CS can be chosen for various reasons, including electives, making it unjustified to enable only vaginal delivery. Further research must show whether a vaginal delivery is indeed compatible, given that the fetal-to-neonatal transition could already be initiated at labor onset by exposure to (hormonal and mechanical) factors associated with parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The discontinuation of transfer to an APAW system necessitates a switch to conventional neonatal care (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) due to human/technological errors or medical necessity.

Simulation-based development requires mediation skills to address stakeholder priorities, particularly during initial technology phases. Isolated single-actor simulations focus on specialty-specific elements while multi-actor sessions with composite teams facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, testing of cross-discipline tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and promote consensus building. Minimizing interruptions to clinical practice and adjusting time investment as needed is crucial. Participant expertise levels evolve through iterations. Co-creation sessions with medical residents can give enough feedback to start concept development, whereas for specific aspects senior clinical professionals are needed to provide targeted input. With this simulation-based development framework, both technical and communication (teamwork) domains were addressed and may better equip a medical team with both soft and hard skills.<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Simulation-based procedure development cycle, with intermittent literature study, interview, and simulation cycles.

We hypothesized that the use of medical simulation will elicit realistic user insights regarding a transfer procedure and improve the development of a protocol and guidelines for obstetric tools. Clinicians actively participated in the design process to create a step-by-step procedure that matches their workflow and is suited to the needs from a clinician&#8217;s perspective. This initial protocol is a foundation, and future research stages should involve patient representatives in expert interviews and simulations to incorporate their insights.</p><p id="Par56">Simulation-based development of novel technologies has long been conducted in the field of spaceflight, as early as during NASA&#8217;s Apollo project with simulation facilities, to test functionality, reliability, and usability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Within healthcare, studies have shown the effective use of simulation-based user-centered design for the development of hospital planning to improve patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and in the development of medical devices for pediatric intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While these examples demonstrate the success of participatory simulation, these applications have not yet included the development of unprecedented extra-corporeal life support technologies. Our work shows that participatory design is an insightful approach to the development of APAW, where user engagement can lead to a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, opportunities, and risks. The method allows stakeholders to engage with complex systems in a safe and controlled environment. Participants may take on different roles and interact with one another to understand how the system works, identify potential problems or opportunities, and develop solutions.</p><p id="Par57">By immersing researchers and clinicians in the operating theater environment, we aimed to gather realistic user insights, hence reducing the need for future protocol modifications when applying a protocol in practice. By gaining direct input from user perspectives, this study identified twelve themes as needing intervention from the existing obstetrics protocol for extremely preterm birth. These include the management of anesthesia, uterine relaxation, maternal blood loss, fetal environmental exposure, maternal positioning, AAF flow into the uterus, monitoring of fetal vital functions, hygiene, mode of transfer, cannulation, rupture of membranes, and the rescue procedure. During the simulations, participants were better able to imagine potential risks, suggest additional protocol requirements, and envision tangible improvement points compared to sessions held in an out-of-context interview setting.</p><p id="Par58">A key insight is to prevent unnecessary administration of medication and the uncertain duration of the suppression by designing the transfer procedure in such a way as to physically prevent air exposure to the human infant. Direct delivery into a transferbag filled with AAF, creating a tunnel, achieves this.</p><p id="Par59">This study also refined the required team composition from preparation to placing the infant in the APAW system. Logistical coordination can be challenging because of the hectic schedules of the many medical professionals that need to be engaged to form a comprehensive overview of the user&#8217;s needs. Portable simulation setups minimize disruption to clinical practice, reduce time investment, avoid unnecessary occupation of operating theatres, and engage multiple clinicians at once. Using simulation is also cost and time-effective while preparing and conducting validation studies. Sessions can be performed on a single simulator several times; it does not need to be planned months ahead, nor does it require all medical experts to be present at the same time. Effective task division could be analyzed through research on mental workload, such as through the NASA task load index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] or its surgical equivalent SURG TLX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Participants can be videotaped from multiple angles, which allows for post-simulation analysis of human factors such as effective task division.</p><p id="Par60">Placing an infant into an extra-corporeal life-support system is a high-risk procedure. Before a first patient could be treated, procedure development requires the understanding of both high and low risks and incidence scenarios. Due to ethical, clinical, practical, and economic considerations, animal studies and/or conventional clinical trials for APAW development are far from straightforward. A simulated environment has many degrees of freedom and may provide an additional research platform. This allows the ability to practice with complex scenarios, such as (simulated) technical failures of the equipment, certain patient pathologies, or other complex clinical situations.</p><p id="Par61">Most of the attention in APAW development and debate has been drawn to the long-term implications, while short-term ethical concerns, such as animal well-being, should not be overlooked. In addition, findings from animal studies do not guarantee consistent findings in human investigations. Longitudinal human clinical trials would still be necessary upon clinical implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, simulation-based development could minimize the number of animal studies needed, bridge the gap between animals and human trials, and thus contribute to a reduced risk for the first human participants.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Rehearsing future care</title><p id="Par62">Although the development of APAW technology is still in its infancy, the developed simulation technology for a potential treatment is not limited to procedure and system development and can already be used for medical training. During medical simulation training a broad range of medical scenarios can be initiated and assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Simulation could allow for practicing and fine-tuning task handling. Another advantage of the use of simulators is the possibility of measuring the learning curve and performance of the user through longitudinal data acquisition during the different design iterations. This could be done by quantifying the proficiency of a certain task as a function of time-to-completion, and the parameter values of vital organs can be monitored to visualize the reaction-time of a certain task to presented symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Physical fetal manikins with embedded digital twin technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] can, in this context, be used to train clinical decision-making. Furthermore, team dynamics can be rehearsed for alignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par63">Translating the medical environment to a simulation involves substituting patients, protocols, tools, and pathologies with manikins, simulation protocols, simulation tools, and scenarios. This translation step will inevitably lead to a decrease in fidelity since an exact artificial replica with all possible functions of the human body cannot be replicated. Maintaining a suspension of disbelief during a simulation session is therefore important to allow participants to focus on the learning objectives rather than being distracted by the limitations of the simulation equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Verification of the realism of the simulation is challenging, as data acquisition during pregnancy is generally limited by non-invasive measurements to protect the mother and fetus. To mitigate this challenge, thorough literature research, continuous feedback (on simulation realism) from clinicians, and the collection of clinical information and data is crucial. Data-driven manikins can also enhance fidelity for early-phase APAW development.</p><p id="Par64">Future simulation research should allow cannulating the umbilical vessels, which was not part of the current study. APAW studies have described the cannulation in different settings, both whilst the animal is still in-utero or ex-utero. Although the simulation sessions of this study only enacted ex-utero cannulation, this should be extended to include in-utero cannulation as well. The majority of animal studies demonstrating successful and rapid cannulation of the umbilical vessels to the extracorporeal circuit have been conducted on sheep, whose umbilical anatomy differs from that of humans (four vessels instead of three), with piglet models being more similar to humans. Simulation technology can be complementary to this research. Through the advancement of the fidelity of the umbilical cord phantoms, such as improving its biomechanical properties, more knowledge can be yielded on cannula design, procedures, and skills.</p><p id="Par65">The simulation protocol created in this study is a dynamic starting point for validation and training.</p><p id="Par66">It serves as a discussion piece and will guide further development of the transfer procedure. Clinical testing is required to ascertain the effectiveness of the procedures in maintaining fetal physiology and preventing fetal-to-neonatal transition, particularly in reducing tactile, thermal, hormonal, and environmental stimuli triggering breathing initiation.</p><p id="Par67">The researchers took the primary roles as simulation designers and used semi-structured interviews and simulation guidelines to foster open discussion and exploration of novel approaches and insights. Due to the semi-structured set-up, bias may have occurred while moderating to engage further in certain topics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Future outlook</title><p id="Par68">The integration of physical manikins with digital twins, incorporating computational models of fetal physiology, could offer a larger array of scenarios (e.g., pathologies) and thereby improve potential for treatment development and training. This could further enrich the simulation-based development method with data-based evaluation of usability, effectiveness, safety, hygiene, and comfort; identifying hazards and human errors, establishing task division among professionals, and ultimately improving the design and treatment protocol. By using real-time feedback from the hybrid manikins regarding participants&#8217; actions and performance, the skill of immediately anticipating new situations can be trained. This method can also be applied to other technical developments in medicine.</p><p id="Par69">Whereas this study engaged primarily with stakeholders from clinical practice, future studies should also include the involvement of patient organizations during the simulations. Through a value-sensitive design approach, the technology and procedure can be better aligned with human patient values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par70">Transferring an infant from the mother&#8217;s womb to a liquid-based perinatal life support system is an unprecedented task and a, very likely, high-risk procedure for which no protocol exists. Most current APAW research is being reviewed in an animal laboratory setting, which might not reflect human patient care. Medical simulation could be used to approximate the human condition and provide a safe and controlled environment to form a shared understanding of procedure requirements. This study demonstrates a simulation-based user-centered development method for designers to co-create with clinicians in early-phase medical treatment development. The presented research focused on protocol development for a transfer procedure to an APAW system and provided a framework that could serve as a basis for procedure development in general. These simulation protocols may also form a basis for the development of medical devices. In summary, this approach fostered collaborative discussions on a variety of themes, including management of anesthesia, hygiene, maternal and fetal safety, teamwork, and effectiveness of the transfer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
