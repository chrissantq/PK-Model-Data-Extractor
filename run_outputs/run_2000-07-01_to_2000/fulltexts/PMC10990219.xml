A key approach to environmental mitigation has been the use of high volume ventilation of enclosed spaces (i.e. adequate flow of fresh, uncontaminated air), which has been shown to decrease the risk of infection from a variety of respiratory pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and this effect has been widely presumed to include SARS-CoV-2. Schools were an immediate focus in many areas with respect to mitigation measures for SARS-CoV-2, including potentially costly recommendations for improving ventilation. However, very little data are available assessing the actual impact of ventilation on in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>The SARS-CoV-2 <italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic>-coronavirus is spread primarily via airborne droplets and aerosols, which can remain circulating for up to three hours [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ventilation is defined as the process of supplying clean air to the indoor air of a dwelling by natural (e.g., open windows if the outdoor air is sufficiently clean) or mechanical means (e.g. heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; HVAC) often involving recirculating the air after cleaning with a filter [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Increasing ventilation is one means of reducing exposure to airborne viral pathogens, and increasing ventilation rates and upgrading inline HVAC particle filters (e.g. from MERV-8 to MERV-13) were widely recommended for public venues including businesses, transportation, and schools [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For schools specifically, improving ventilation as a risk reduction strategy was the subject of many recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, very little robust data are available assessing the actual impact of improved ventilation on in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2. One study found 74% lower aggregate rates of COVID-19 in schools with mechanical versus natural ventilation [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While there have been reports of outbreaks within schools [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a number of epidemiological studies have concluded that students and school staff had relatively low risk of SARS-CoV-2 in-school transmission [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and schools were unlikely to be a major factor in the pandemic spread [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite the larger number of epidemiological studies in public schools, we are not aware of similar studies in schools for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who face greater risks [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and impacts from, infection. The majority of students with IDD are served by IDD-specialized schools that provide educational services, comprehensive clinical services, speech and psychological interventions, nutritional needs, and physical care. Staff-to-student ratios are much higher than in typical K-12 schools, with more frequent, sustained and close physical contact between staff and students [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Students with an IDD are at higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], severe infection, and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The IDD spectrum covers many conditions (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, genetic disorders), which are associated with immune abnormalities that increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 and poor vaccine responses [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Many students with an IDD have difficulty with conventional infection prevention measures such as masking and social distancing. This also puts staff in IDD settings at higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic but infected students. Conversely, the impact on IDD students, and their caregivers, of school closures, isolation and quarantine is heightened [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. IDD students receive many specialized services (e.g. physical and speech therapy) in school that are not readily available at home. Thus, it is essential to identify interventions that are implementable in the unique environment of IDD-specialized schools that retain students in school while mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased ventilation has been proposed as one such measure.</p><p>Time series measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been used as a frequent surrogate for ventilation adequacy in schools [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As CO<sub>2</sub> is exhaled during respiration, it accumulates in indoor spaces depending on the air exchange rates. The dynamic balance between CO<sub>2</sub> production and ventilation with air having a lower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration determines the time-varying CO<sub>2</sub> concentration within a room. Accordingly, time series measurements of room CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations can be used to derive a surrogate marker for ventilation adequacy, typically measured as air changes per hour (ACH) [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. International guidelines recommend a minimum of 4 ACH for school classrooms, and 8&#8211;15 ACH for auditoriums, athletic facilities, cafeterias and other high-density or high-activity enclosed spaces [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mismatched ventilation can result in elevated indoor CO<sub>2</sub> levels that can affect learning and cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], areas of key focus in schools for students with an IDD. Unfortunately, many school buildings have outdated HVAC systems, resulting in low or very low ACH [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) program &#8220;Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations (RADx-UP)&#8221; was designed to study ways to support vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. A major goal of the program was to study strategies to keep vulnerable populations of students in school while mitigating the risk of exposure and in-school spread of SARS-CoV-2 among students and staff. Primarily designed to study the utility of screening for infection with frequent molecular testing, our RADx-UP project work has also focused on the effect of a variety of measures on mitigating exposure and infection in an IDD-specialized school setting. Here we report the results of an extensive study of ventilation across 3 buildings and 100 rooms in an IDD school for children and young adults (ages 3&#8211;21 years) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Human subjects protection</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Rochester Medical Center Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB STUDY00005294).

Monitors were placed on the ceiling near the air return vents in the center of the room to ensure mixing and avoid dead spaces within each room. In a small number of rooms, where ceiling placement was not possible, monitors were placed on side walls near air return vents. The indicator screens of the devices were covered so that classroom occupants would not alter ventilation (e.g. open windows or doors) outside of their usual pattern. Sensors were set to record ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, and humidity levels every 2 minutes continuously for 24&#8211;72 hours. Data were downloaded to an iPad (Apple Inc., Cupertino CA) using the Aranet manufacturer&#8217;s software as a .CSV file. Each record in a .CSV file identified the sensor and time of each measurement. A separate .CSV file identified the school room and sampling start and stop times. Individual .CSV files were then processed with a custom R program that added the unique room ID number to each record based on the sampling start and stop times and the unique sensor ID. Duplicate records were removed. The final data set contained 150,286 individual measurements (<xref rid="pone.0291840.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).

However, the HVAC systems had slightly different temperature set-points at night, which may have led to different ventilation rates, underestimating daytime ACH [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, the HVAC systems were set primarily to maintain temperature, and thus higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may have been due to lower air circulation when the heat generated by room occupancy decreased the need for higher rates of heated air circulation [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Ventilation rates can also vary in both naturally- and mechanically-ventilated buildings, depending the indoor-outdoor temperature difference, wind speed, heating and cooling load, building envelope leakage, and other factors that may change over time [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our measurements were performed in the winter season (November) over 3 contiguous days, when heating was necessary due to outside temperatures, which is relevant to both HVAC use and the respiratory virus season in the northern hemisphere. These factors suggest that use of CO<sub>2</sub> level ranges normalized to occupancy, with the above caveats, may be a practical method to estimate ventilation adequacy in schools than CO<sub>2</sub> derived ACH measures.</p><p>Many have suggested that CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring could be used as a surrogate for adequate ventilation [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. While the primary goal of this work was to provide an estimate of the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infections and room ventilation in an IDD school, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on their own may decrease cognitive task performance [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], concentration [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], increase cough and rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and teacher&#8217;s reporting of health symptoms (e.g. fatigue, headache) [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Especially in schools for IDD students, improving ventilation, and achieving recommended CO<sub>2</sub> levels is likely to be important for school attendance [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], learning, and cognitive task performance [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> levels would provide real-time data in classrooms, and could be used to motivate interventions to improve ventilation and decrease CO<sub>2</sub> levels, from simple measures such as opening windows when possible to large-scale upgrades of school HVAC systems. Such measures should, however, be correlated with more rigorous measures of ventilation to account for numerous factors important for interpretation of the results [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Finally, it is important to note that we did not measure individual exposure over time to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, but rather concentrations in rooms. Individuals generally move between classrooms, therapy rooms, the outdoors, and other school areas, although less so during COVID.</p><p>This study also highlights the potential trade-offs in terms of improving in-line filtration and ventilation of particles and droplets to prevent infection and the potential expense required to upgrade HVAC systems in many schools [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Circulating air through a higher resistance particulate filter may not be possible for many older HVAC systems, requiring an expensive upgrade. In addition, filters may decrease ventilation rates, raising ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, particulate, and volatile organic compound concentrations. Increasing the percentage of outdoor air brought in creates a trade-off between improved ventilation and the need to heat, cool, and condition the humidity of the incoming fresh air, increasing energy costs [<xref rid="pone.0291840.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291840.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Similarly, for IDD schools, measures such as opening windows create another trade off between improved ventilation and student safety. Given the vintage of most public school buildings and HVAC systems, as well as the budgets available for upgrades and remediation measures, this issue may benefit from more public funding and policy discussions.</p><p>One goal of community engaged research partnerships is to have direct impact on improving outcomes highly valued by the community. The comprehensive sampling in 100 rooms across 3 buildings revealed a wide variation in ventilation rates, as well as number of hours exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> levels greater than 1,000 ppm. Only 8 rooms had levels of CO<sub>2</sub> &#8805; 2,000 ppm for more than 30&#8211;130 minutes over the course of a school day, and of those 7 of 8 rooms were in the same building. These findings were subsequently validated by an independent HVAC contractor engaged by the school. Of note, the rooms with ventilation served by HVAC systems with MERV-13 filters had lower rates of PCR test positives for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results have sparked discussion about upgrade of the ventilation systems. The school continues to seek state and federal funding in an on-going effort to ensure and exceed the ventilation standards recommended for schools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There was a statistically significant correlation between rooms with CO<sub>2</sub> levels &#8805;1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school.

</p><p>PONE-D-23-26827Ventilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Zand,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>==============================</p><p>ACADEMIC EDITOR:&#160;&#160;After taking into account the comments and feedback from all the reviewers, my overall decision is Minor Revisions.

</p><p>Response to Reviewers: PONE-D-23-26827: Ventilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) </p><p>N.B. Please note that all line references [e.g. L25-31] refer to lines in the marked up PDF, not the clean copy.</p><p>Reviewer #1: The research article indicates the study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 &#8805;1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Different ways of mitigating this issue is well explained. Statistical analysis and the figures are depicted appropriately. Further the experimentation as per the research is accomplished for the set purpose. the conclusion drawn is structured and provides some evidential inferences. Henceforth the research article is strongly accepted for publishing.</p><p>We thank reviewer #1 for their comments, which do not recommend any changes.</p><p>N.B. Reviewer #2 included over 100 separate bullet points, a number of which were comments and not requests for revisions. For clarity, we have consolidated all the points, and only included those below that requested changes in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This article (Ventilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD)) investigates SARS-CoV-2 transmission in an IDD school and its relationship with ventilation and CO2 levels. Findings reveal that less than 20% of staff and students had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, consistent with previous school studies. CO2 monitoring is highlighted as a potential tool to assess ventilation adequacy, with elevated CO2 levels impacting cognitive performance and health. The study emphasizes the need for improved ventilation and air filtration in schools and discusses the associated trade-offs, particularly for IDD-specialized schools. Public funding and policy discussions are suggested to address these challenges and enhance safety in educational settings. However, the authors could address the following suggestions for improving the quality of the article:</p><p>Literature Review: Could include more recent research on SARSCoV2 transmission in schools.</p><p>The literature on SARS-CoV-2 in schools is, as noted, extremely sparse. We have updated the references to include recent references [L12-14 and L30-34].</p><p>Specific Aims and Research Gap: Could benefit from explicitly stating the research aims. Needs a clearer statement of the research gap in the existing literature regarding ventilation and SARSCoV2 in IDD specialized schools. </p><p>We have revised the introduction to explicitly state the research aims [L12-14]. We have also added a statement that, to our knowledge, there is no literature regarding ventilation and SARS-CoV-2 in IDD Schools [L32-34] </p><p>NIH RADxUP Program: Might benefit from a brief description of the project's objectives within this context. We have revised the manuscript to frame the project&#8217;s objectives. [L76-81]</p><p>Room and Building Data: Information about HVAC systems and their significance would be helpful. Significance of HVAC systems, in general, was provided in the original manuscript in the introduction [L16-30]. Information linked to each HVAC system was provided in Supplemental File S1, linked to each room [L99]. We have revised the manuscript to provide some framing information about HVAC systems and their significance in ventilation [L207-208; L211-212]</p><p>SARSCoV2 Case Data: Defined the timeframe for data collection but could include the rationale. Respectfully, we did not have a choice regarding timeframe. SARSCoV2 case data collection began when NY State mandated reporting for schools and the , and we selected a 1 year period after this. Given the nature of the pandemic, we would not have been able to accurately &#8220;select&#8221; a timeframe prospectively for data collection.</p><p>CO2 Measurements: More information about the rationale for the specific measurement date might be beneficial. We have revised the manuscript to include an explanation for the selected measurement date range [L109-110].</p><p>Room Characteristics: Explanation of the significance of HVAC systems and MERV filters might enhance understanding. As noted above, we have added explanations of HVAC systems and MERV filters [L165-169].</p><p>CO2 Level Profiles: Could benefit from explaining the significance of these patterns. We are unclear which patterns the reviewer is referring to: the time-varying patterns of the measurements, the pattern of distribution within the buildings. The variation in patterns is already discussed, with notes regarding the significance (drowsiness, adherence to recommended standards). Thus, we have not modified this section.</p><p>Room CO2 Concentrations: Explanation of the chosen CO2 ranges and their relevance is suggested. Respectfully, the manuscript provides references to the CO2 ranges [L189; L191; L194]. The CO2 ranges are, as referenced, those recommended by national standards in the US by ASRHE and OSHA, as noted in the caption for Figure 3, and the references. Nonetheless, we have duplicated this information in the text [L187-189]</p><p>Peak CO2 Levels by Room Functional Type and Building: Context about rooms with wider CO2 level distributions might be valuable. We respectfully note that this is beyond the scope of the manuscript. CO2 levels are highly complex, and depend on room volume, room occupancy, activity level, ventilation (both active and passive), seasonality, and a large variety of factors we intentionally did not measure. The focus of the manuscript was to estimate ventilation with real-world data, not to intricately model all the factors that might have contributed to CO2 levels.</p><p>Temperature versus CO2 Relationship: Some interpretation or discussion regarding temperature fluctuations would enhance this section. We have added to the existing discussion regarding temperature fluctuations [L214-215; L218-220; L222-223].</p><p>Air Changes per Hour Estimates: Implications for ventilation could be discussed. Thank you for your comment. This is most appropriately addressed in the Discussion section, rather than in Results, which we have done.</p><p>Incidence of SARSCoV2Positive PCR Tests: Discussion of the practical implications is needed. Thank you for your comment. This is most appropriately addressed in the Discussion section, rather than in Results, which we have done.</p><p>Overall Interpretation: Should state the primary objective of the study more explicitly. We have restated the primary objective [L268-270], which was also stated in the introduction. </p><p>Interpretation of Findings: Needs to clarify the practical significance of not achieving an ACH &#8805; 4. The caveats related to using CO2 to estimate ACH need to be concise. We have addressed the recommendations of an ACH&gt;4. Respectfully, while we done some editing for conciseness [L288-304], the issue of using CO2 to estimate ACH is complex, with a robust literature. Our discussion provides a number of critical caveats that would be important for a school measuring CO2 levels to consider for accurate use of this method, and to not overstate the utility of CO2 level measurements.</p><p>CO2 Monitoring: Needs more explicit recommendations for using CO2 monitoring in schools. Suggests discussing the thresholds for CO2 levels. Could elaborate on the connection between students' ability to tolerate masking and CO2 levels. Explicit recommendations for monitoring CO2 levels in schools are controversial, as noted by ASHRE. We have revised the manuscript to discuss this [L316-329]. Respectfully, we are not clear what &#8220;connection between the students ability to tolerate masking and CO2 levels&#8221; is referring to. Regardless of masking, expired CO2 will be the same, as masks are permeable to CO2; Masking is a neutral intervention in terms of CO2 levels. Thus, we have not addressed this in the discussion. </p><p>Ventilation and Air Filtration: Could be more concise and structured. The part about energy costs and outdoor air could be more concise. Respectfully, all the issues briefly raised are critical considerations in terms of tradeoffs. In particular, there is only single sentence about outdoor air heating and energy costs, which is already concise [L336-338]. We have left this as is.</p><p>Community Engagement and Policy Implications: Might benefit from specific examples or proposals. Consider elaborating on how the research partnership influenced the school. Respectfully, specific examples at the end of the study would greatly expand the scope of the paper, without hard data. Rather than adding anecdotal examples, this will be the subject of an additional manuscript.</p><p>Conclusions: A summary of key findings and implications is suggested. We have added this.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Authors investigated the correlation of classroom ventilation and exposure to CO2 with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Study has deeply examined the strategies to keep the vulnerable populations of students in school while mitigating the risk of exposure and in-school spread of SARS-CoV-2 among students and staff.

We have revised the discussion section to cautiously suggest some points to policy makers. We are very mindful that as a single school study, in a very distinct population, it likely does not rise to the level that would warranted basing </p><p>Add some statistical bars (error bars or standard deviation) in the figures if possible. Respectfully, error bars were added when appropriate or relevant. Examples of CO2 concentration measurements over time are not averages, and thus error bars are not appropriate [Fig 1, 3, 6]. Similarly, figures that contain histograms counts would not have error bars [Fig 2A, 7A]. Points denoting mean minimum and maximum ACH have standard deviations of &lt;5% for all estimates, and error bars on each of 100 points would make the figures unreadable. Supplemental Figure 2 does show mean and standard deviation for each ACH estimate.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0291840.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PLoS Rev Full reorg.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0291840.s004.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0291840.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0291840.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names initials="Y">Yanping</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2024 Yanping Yuan</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2024</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Yanping Yuan</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="38568915"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>The response to reviewers is also submitted in a formatted document.</p><p>Response to Reviewers: PONE-D-23-26827: Ventilation during COVID-19 in a school for students</p><p>with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD)</p><p>Response to Reviewers 1 and 3: We thank the reviewers for having recommended accepting the manuscript with no further revisions. </p><p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p><p>1. The article lacks chapter numbers throughout. Respectfully, the article was prepared according the PLoS One Instructions for Authors style guide, which does not require chapter numbers. Indeed, the sample manuscript body in the Instructions to Authors (, and the available templates provided on the web site, do not include this formatting. We have thus not changed the manuscript so that we remain within the format required by PLoS.</p><p>2. The figures lack titles and numbering, and the data within them contains three-line indications without corresponding labels for each line. </p><p>The Figures are submitted per the instructions for authors: &#8220;Do not include author names, article title, or figure number/title/caption within figure files. That information will go into your figure caption in the manuscript&#8221;. Numbering is present in both the figure legends and in the upper right corner of the pages containing the figure itself in the reviewer&#8217;s copy. Thus, to remain within the format required by PLoS, we have not changed the figures to include numbers and titles.</p><p>3. Additionally, the graphs utilize multiple colors for different lines. Please differentiate the graph lines using distinct styles. </p><p>The reviewer did not specify which graph is referred to, and so we have responded for each graph:</p><p>Figure 1 &#8211; Each panel has more than one line uses a different style: A) there are two lines in the graph, one solid with coloring explained in the figure legend, and the other dashed B) there is one solid line (fitted curve), and multiple data points. We have not changed the figure.</p><p>Figure 2 &#8211; Neither panel A or B contain &#8220;different lines&#8221; &#8211; A) is a histogram and B) is a scatter plot without a line. As the comment does not appear to apply to this figure, we have not changed it.</p><p>Figure 3 &#8211; Each panel with more than one line uses a different style: A) there are two lines in the graph, one solid with coloring explained in the figure legend, and the other dashed B) There are no lines, each is a scatter plot. We have not changed the figure.</p><p>Figure 4 &#8211; This is a stack graph, with no data lines. As the comment does not appear to apply to this figure, we have not changed it.</p><p>Figure 5 &#8211; There are three &#8220;lines&#8221; denoting the bands corresponding to CO2 level boundaries, clearly explained in the legend. All are dashed, and a corresponding color-coded bar on the y-axis serves as a second guide for the reader to the CO2 level bands. Using a distinct style for each boundary line would detract from the figure clarity. We have not changed the figure.</p><p>Figure 6 &#8211; These are time vs. value dot plots of the masurements. Given the measurement density, to plot them as lines that would be distinguishable by pattern (e.g. dashed, dot-dash, solid) would require significant down-sampling the data for smoothing, detracting from the accuracy and rigorous presentation of the data. We have not changed the figure.</p><p>Figure 7 &#8211; A is a histogram, and C is a biplot with a single superimposed line. We have changed panel C so that line style differs among the ACH levels, as reqeusted.</p><p>Figure 8 &#8211; Panel A is a box-plot and B is are biplots, Neither panel contains &#8220;different lines&#8221;.</p><p>As the comment does not appear to apply to this figure, we have not changed it.</p><p>4. Refer to the following transaction journal and include it in the reference section that is more suitable for this article</p><p>(a) Covid-19: automatic detection of the novel coronavirus disease from CT images using an optimized convolutional neural network.</p><p>(b) The role of internet of things to control the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic</p><p>Respectfully, we are very confused by these comments. Our article does not refer at any point to medical imaging, the use of neural networks, or the internet of things. Is it possible that these comments might refer to a different manuscript than ours? If not, we would very much appreciate a clearer elucidation of these concerns.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0291840.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers Rev2.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0291840.s005.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0291840.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0291840.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names initials="Y">Yanping</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2024 Yanping Yuan</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2024</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Yanping Yuan</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0291840" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
