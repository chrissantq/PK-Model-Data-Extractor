Monosaccharide polymers have many favourable properties such as high stability, non-toxicity, hydrophilicity, biodegradability, gel forming properties and ease of chemical modification [<xref rid="B1-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An enormous variety in plant polysaccharide structural composition exists, which is not only associated with different plants, but also with the part of the plant that they originate from, such as the leaves, seeds, roots and tubers. The complexity and variety of polysaccharides can be explained by two unique structural features: firstly monosaccharides can be linked together in different ways (1&#8594;2, 1&#8594;3, 1&#8594;4, 1&#8594;5 and 1&#8594;6, in an <italic toggle="yes">&#945;-</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic>-configuration) and secondly, due to the presence of branched side-chains [<xref rid="B3-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Complex carbohydrates obtained from natural sources such as plants have shown diverse biological activities such as wound healing, enhancement of the reticuloendothelial system, stimulation of the immune system, treatment of tumours and effects on the hematopoietic system [<xref rid="B4-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Aloe vera</italic> (L.) Burm.f. (<italic toggle="yes">Aloe barbadensis</italic> Miller) is a perennial succulent xerophyte, which develops water storage tissue in the leaves to survive in dry areas of low or erratic rainfall. The innermost part of the leaf is a clear, soft, moist and slippery tissue that consists of large thin-walled parenchyma cells in which water is held in the form of a viscous mucilage [<xref rid="B5-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, the thick fleshy leaves of aloe plants contain not only cell wall carbohydrates such as cellulose and hemicellulose but also storage carbohydrates such as acetylated mannans [<xref rid="B3-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> has been used for many centuries for its curative and therapeutic properties and although over 75 active ingredients from the inner gel have been identified, therapeutic effects have not been correlated well with each individual component [<xref rid="B6-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many of the medicinal effects of aloe leaf extracts have been attributed to the polysaccharides found in the inner leaf parenchymatous tissue [<xref rid="B7-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but it is believed that these biological activities should be assigned to a synergistic action of the compounds contained therein rather than a single chemical substance [<xref rid="B9-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> is the most commercialised aloe species and processing of the leaf pulp has become a large worldwide industry. In the food industry, it has been used as a source of functional foods and as an ingredient in other food products, for the production of gel-containing health drinks and beverages. In the cosmetic and toiletry industry, it has been used as base material for the production of creams, lotions, soaps, shampoos, facial cleansers and other products.</p><p>In the pharmaceutical industry, it has been used for the manufacture of topical products such as ointments and gel preparations, as well as in the production of tablets and capsules [<xref rid="B10-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Due to its absorption enhancing effects, <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> gel may be employed to effectively deliver poorly absorbable drugs through the oral route of drug administration. Furthermore, the dried powder obtained from <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> gel was successfully used to manufacture directly compressible matrix type tablets.

Description of the inner central part of the aloe leaf may sometimes be confusing, due to the different terms that are used interchangeably such as inner pulp, mucilage tissue, mucilaginous gel, mucilaginous jelly, inner gel and leaf parenchyma tissue. Technically, the term &#8216;pulp&#8217; or &#8216;parenchyma tissue&#8217; refers to the intact fleshy inner part of the leaf including the cell walls and organelles, while &#8216;gel&#8217; or &#8216;mucilage&#8217; refers to the viscous clear liquid within the parenchyma cells [<xref rid="B7-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The three structural components of the <italic toggle="yes">Aloe vera</italic> pulp are the cell walls, the degenerated organelles and the viscous liquid contained within the cells.

An overall carbohydrate analysis of the alcohol insoluble residues showed that the cell walls in the fillet of the aloe leaf hold mainly mannose-containing polysaccharides, cellulose and pectic polysaccharides whereas the skin of the leaf contains in addition significant quantities of xylose-containing polysaccharides [<xref rid="B18-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p><p>Many investigators have identified partially acetylated mannan (or acemannan) as the primary polysaccharide of the gel, while others found pectic substance as the primary polysaccharide.

The directly compressed matrix type tablets also showed modified release behaviour with 35.45% and 30.70% of the dose released during the first hour and the remaining of the dose was released over a 6 hour period for those formulations containing the lower ratios of gel to drug, namely 1:0.5 and 1:1.

The mechanism of this immune protection effect by the polysaccharides in the gel differs from those described for anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatories and DNA-repair enzymes. Although anti-inflammatory agents have been identified in <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic>, the polysaccharides failed to reduce UV-induced edema and inflammation as well as to accelerate excision and repair of UV-induced cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimmers. In addition, anti-oxidants must be present in the skin before UV-irradiation to be effective while aloe polysaccharides are effective even when applied up to 24 h post UV exposure. The immune protection action therefore occurs at a step downstream from DNA damage and repair, possibly by modulating DNA-damage-activated signal transduction pathways.

Many anthraquinones have shown antiviral and/or virucidal effects on enveloped viruses [<xref rid="B52-molecules-13-01599" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> has a long history as a medicinal plant with diverse therapeutic applications. Although it was claimed that some of the biological activities of this plant can be attributed to the polysaccharides found in the leaf gel, it is a daunting task to link individual polysaccharides to specific therapeutic properties. Differences in plant composition due to geographic location as well as differences in gel extraction methods and sample preparation techniques have contributed to discrepancies in the results obtained from many studies in terms of the chemical composition and biological activities of <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> leaf gel. Although some indications were found that a particular polysaccharide is effective when tested for a specific biological activity, it seems as if it is rather a combination of compounds that account for the health benefits of <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> leaf gel. With technological developments in the field of analytical chemistry it has become easier to isolate and characterise the chemical components of the leaf gel and it is expected that more information in this regard will become available in the future at a faster rate. Interesting pharmaceutical applications such as intestinal absorption enhancement activities and skin penetration improvement effects have recently been shown for <italic toggle="yes">A. vera</italic> gel. The dried gel has also showed potential as an excipient in modified release matrix type tablets. More applications are discovered as research from different view points is conducted on this versatile plant to provide a better understanding of its composition and effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-molecules-13-01599"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>V.R.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Kumria</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Polysaccharides in colon-specific drug delivery</article-title><source>Int.
