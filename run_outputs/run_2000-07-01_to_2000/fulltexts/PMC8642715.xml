Immunocompromised hosts whose immunologic mechanism is suboptimal constitute a significant proportion of the critically infected population [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cases of fungal infections like mucormycosis post-COVID treatment has enhanced our focus on immunosuppression and its complications. In conditions like trauma, surgery, and radiation, stress-induced immunosuppression occurs. A human being encounters variety of stressors throughout the life. Surgical stress is one such important stressor. Ability to combat such stressors and maintain health involves interplay of the neuroendocrine system, immune system, and defense mechanisms of peripheral or target organs. In patients who undergo major surgery, immunosuppression has been reported as a leading cause of infection and is responsible for mortality and morbidity in the immediate post-operative period [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Our immune system is versatile and capable of recognizing and eliminating a variety of foreign invaders through a variety of defense mechanisms. A number of morphologically and functionally diverse organs and tissues participate in development of immune response. One of the important organs of immune system is spleen. The incidental reports mention a relationship between splenectomy and infection; it was not until 1952 that a causative association was reported between splenectomy (for congenital hemolytic anemia) and the occurrence of meningitis with sepsis. Since then, the increased risk of infection and septicemia directly related to splenectomy has been well-defined in the literature. Such infections are now generally termed overwhelming post-splenectomy infections (OPSI) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">In modern medicine, infections are treated using antimicrobial agents that inhibit or kill the microorganisms. With the advent of antimicrobial agents, it was believed that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated and become of historic interest only. However, the evolution of new infective diseases like COVID-19 and susceptibility of immunocompromised hosts to fatal opportunistic infections poses a greater challenge. Hence, it was felt necessary to search for agents that can be given to immunocompromised patients like patients with splenectomy to facilitate regeneration of spleen with preservation of its function and also have immunomodulatory activity. Ayurveda describes certain drugs which belong to <italic toggle="yes">rasayana</italic> group [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Rasayana</italic> drugs are known to have immunnostimulant properties. According to Ayurveda, these drugs also have rejuvenating potential as well. <italic toggle="yes">Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (Tc) a widely researched <italic toggle="yes">rasayana</italic> plant drug has shown to regenerate splenic cells in a model of hemisplenectomized mice and protect against <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, many a times Tc is available in market in combinations with other drugs. One such formulation is that of Tc and <italic toggle="yes">Phyllanthus emblica</italic> (Pe). <italic toggle="yes">P.&#160;emblica</italic> is also a <italic toggle="yes">rasayana</italic> drug and as per Ayurveda, has affinity towards spleen [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Ocimum sanctum</italic> (Os) is yet another agent which has shown to enhance humoral antibody responses [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is administered either as a fresh juice of leaves or is used to coat other plant drug particles and described as <italic toggle="yes">bhavana</italic>. As per Ayurveda and literature, <italic toggle="yes">bhavana</italic> increases the efficacy of the coated drugs [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Since the individual drugs Tc and Pe have shown to possess immunomodulatory effects, it was of interest to compare the immunomodulatory effects of combination of these with those of Tc alone. Hence, it was decided to evaluate the effects of the two formulations of Indian medicinal plants, Tc and Pe with or without Os (Tc&#160;+&#160;Pe and Tc&#160;+&#160;Pe&#160;+&#160;Os) on immunomodulatory function of spleen in hemisplenectomized mice and compared the same with that of Tc alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><p id="p0025">Permission from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee from Seth G.

While selecting the animal model of major surgery, the literature revealed that the models of major surgery include amputation and gastrectomy. [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, mutilation and morbidity as a result of these surgeries is very high. [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Such experiments are usually not permitted by the Animal Ethics Committee of the institute as they cause pain and permanent disability in animals.

[<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hence, for the present study it was decided to carry out hemisplenectomy in Swiss albino mice and find out whether they could survive for 30 days or more.

Clinical studies have shown that disseminated candidiasis is more common following major abdominal surgeries [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Severe infection itself causes immunosuppression [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is clinically accepted that major surgery suppresses cell mediated immunity for several days and that more invasive procedures lead to deeper and longer immunosuppression. This immunosuppression can be quite profound, and many believe that it is a major factor in promoting life-threatening post-operative infections [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">As mentioned in the results, survival at the end of 30 days was 100% for both hemisplenectomized and sham operated groups. This indicates that the mice recover from the operative stress without any mortality or morbidity and loss of half of the spleen does not cause any complications if the animals are maintained under the normal housing conditions of the animal house. The question remained whether there exist, an immunosuppression in hemisplenectomized animals. It has been reported that splenic immune functions are severely compromised only when more than 75% of the spleen is removed or damaged leading to increased susceptibility to various infections [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, some researchers have also reported increased susceptibility to infection in hemisplenectomized mice as compared to normal mice demonstrating that the immune response is not optimal [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="p0145">Hence, after mastering the technique of hemisplenectomy, it was decided to induce infection in hemisplenectomized mice. Clinical studies have shown that disseminated candidiasis is more common following major abdominal surgeries [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Elimination of <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> from an infected host requires the cooperation of many immune cells and their products. There is no evidence that antibody and complement can mediate the lysis of <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> ref, and phagocytes are probably the prime effector cells to prevent candidiasis [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a part of reticuloendothelial system, spleen plays an important role in the defense against systemic candidiasis through its macrophages and ability to opsonize the fungi [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> was selected as the insulting organism. The next concern was what should be the strength and the route administration of <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> organisms in the hemisplenectomized mice so that the resulting immunosuppression leads to at least 80% mortality.</p><p id="p0150">Rajakaruna et&#160;al, showed that these plants do not have anti-fungal effects. [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Hence, one option was to study the effects of the test formulations in combination with sub-therapeutic doses of anti-fungal agents against the lethal concentrations of <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> and find out whether they potentiate the anti-fungal effects by boosting immune system. This option was discarded as the literature search revealed that anti-fungal agents themselves have an immunomodulatory effect, which could act as a confounding factor while evaluating the test formulations. [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p id="p0155">Studies have shown that after systemic candidial infection, the fungi localize to the kidneys. [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Lionakis et&#160;al reported that in a mouse model of invasive candidiasis, fungal burden changes with variable dynamics in the kidney, brain, spleen, and liver and declines in all organs except for the kidneys. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] It has also been reported that 10<sup>5</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> injected intravenously required a period of around two weeks for colonization in kidneys. [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Hence, it was felt that in the present study, in the surviving mice given 10<sup>5</sup> fungal load intravenously, fungal load in the kidneys should be estimated on day 15 of surgery. If the fungal burden was high, then it could serve as a surrogate marker for immunosuppression secondary to surgical stress. When serial dilutions of kidney homogenates were studied, all dilutions showed presence of fungal colonies. This proved that hemisplenectomized mice injected with 10<sup>5</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> intravenously had high fungal load in the kidneys.</p><p id="p0160">As a next step it was decided to confirm the effects of the positive control Tc, against the fungal load in these mice. Although Tc has been shown to reduce the mortality after systemic candidial infections, its effects on the fungal load has not been reported [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To shorten the period of standardization, therapy with 200&#160;mg/kg of Tc was given for 7 days prior to surgery. This dose and duration produces effects similar to those with 100&#160;mg/kg given for 14 days [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the control group, as observed earlier there was a massive growth of colonies in almost all dilutions; on the other hand, kidney homogenates of Tc treated mice did not show any growth beyond 1 in 10<sup>3</sup> dilutions. These results confirmed that the model was standardized. Further it was decided to use only five serial dilutions of kidney homogenates ranging from 1 in 10 to 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> to detect the effects of test drugs. Having established two different models of stress-induced immunosuppression, experiments were undertaken to evaluate effects of the study drugs. The selected test drug formulations were administered orally to the animals before exposing them to stress as per the principles of pro-host therapy [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As there is no pharmacokinetic data available for plant drugs, it was decided to pre-treat the animals with the drugs to ensure attainment of adequate concentrations at the site before subjecting them to the insult. The duration of pre-treatment was selected as 15 days prior to the experimental procedure as Tc given in a dose of 100&#160;mg/kg exhibits its effects by 15 days [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The treatment was continued for another 14 days to maintain the concentrations in the post-operative period.</p><p id="p0165">The test formulations showed significant reduction in the fungal burden of kidneys as compared to hemisplenectomized control group. However, Tc alone exerted better degree of protection. Thus, the formulations Tc&#160;+&#160;Pe and Tc&#160;+&#160;Pe&#160;+&#160;Os that were developed on the basis of theoretical concepts were not found to be superior to Tc. The immune stimulatory activity is also reflected in protection against the <italic toggle="yes">C.&#160;albicans</italic> infection. Both the formulations reduced the kidney fungal load. However, Tc alone was found to offer better degree of protection. This may be due to macrophage stimulatory activity of Tc rather than effect on B lymphocytes.</p><p id="p0170">Earlier Alrumaihi and colleagues have reported that extracts of Tc has the potential to reinvigorate the debilitated immune system and eliminate systemic candidiasis in mice [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Multiple studies have earlier highlighted the immunomodulatory role of Tc [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>].</p><p id="p0175">The multi-ingredient formulations stated in Ayurveda (using the concept of <italic toggle="yes">pathsanyojana</italic>) have evolved through the intellectual exercise as well as the clinical experience of physicians [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

If combinations of Ayurvedic drugs are to be developed today, they should be backed by the rigorous scientific studies not only to generate evidence regarding their efficacy and safety but also their superiority over the single plant drugs incorporated in them. The present study is an example of an approach that can be adopted while developing new formulations of drugs from Ayurveda. It also highlights the importance of comparing the combinations with the single plant drugs incorporated in them. Such an approach will prevent the flooding of the market with proprietary multi-ingredient Ayurvedic formulations which may be effective and safe but not superior to individual plant drugs and offer no added advantage.

The present study also underlines the need to have a strict regulation of plant drugs whereby polyherbal formulations are marketed only after comparing their effects against the single plant drug incorporated therein.
