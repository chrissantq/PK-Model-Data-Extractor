[<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is a NET ligand and effective targeted radiotherapeutic, but relapse, especially in the bone marrow compartment, is common. Here we show that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG, an alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceutical, shows comparable efficacy to [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in preclinical models of neuroblastoma. Alpha particle emission leads to lethal ionization damage to DNA and targets isolated cancer cells and regresses small metastatic cancer cell clusters. Clinical experience with [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG highlights its efficacy in necrosis of soft-tissue masses. Thus. the two radionuclides have potentially complementary roles in neuroblastoma. These data support the clinical development of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG as a radiotherapeutic that would be complementary to [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in terms of radiobiological properties and clinical indications.</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately half of the patients with high-risk neuroblastoma are not cured with existing multimodality treatments, and more effective therapies are urgently needed (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). Neuroblastoma is a radiosensitive embryonal malignancy derived from neural crest progenitor cells of the developing sympathetic nervous system. About 85% of neuroblastomas abundantly express the lineage-restricted norepinephrine transporter (NET; derived from the <italic toggle="yes">SLC6A</italic> gene) on the cell surface (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). [<sup>131</sup>I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG), a radioactive substrate for NET that is administered systemically to deliver &#946;-particle radiation directly to neuroblastoma cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>) is currently in phase III testing for neuroblastoma (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT03126916">NCT03126916</ext-link>), and is FDA approved for the treatment of NET-overexpressing pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG has been shown to have single-agent response rates of 30% to 40% in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7&#8211;9</xref>), and the availability of sensitive and specific imaging with [<sup>123</sup>I]MIBG allows for careful selection of patients for [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG therapy and monitoring of antitumor response.</p><p>Despite the overall impressive activity of [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in this disease, responses are typically transient. This is thought to be due in large part to the fact that &#946;-particles like those from <sup>131</sup>I are suboptimal for killing isolated cells, or small cell clumps, due to their long path lengths. This is inferred from the fact that majority of treatment failures are in the bone marrow compartment (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2, 10</xref>), where we hypothesize that the long path length of the &#946;-particle emitted by <sup>131</sup>I (millimeters) is ineffective in eliminating micrometastatic disease. In addition, &#946;-particles have a long range in tissues and deposit their energy over several millimeters. The fraction of absorbed radiation dose in tumor decreases with the decreasing size of the tumor. The calculated ratio of fractional absorbed dose from the alpha particle emitter Astatine-211 (<sup>211</sup>At) to that from Yttrium-90 has been estimated to be 9 and 33 for 1,000 and 200 &#956;m diameter tumors, respectively. Thus, alpha particles would be more appropriate for the treatment of smaller tumors (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;13</xref>). The development of a targeted radiotherapeutic approach that would selectively destroy these isolated cell clusters has the potential to dramatically improve durable response rates and outcomes.</p><p>There has been considerable interest in &#945;-particle emitting radiopharmaceuticals due to the favorable radiobiologic properties of dense ionization of the tissues they enter, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks that is independent of free radical formation over much shorter path lengths (tens of microns) resulting in targeted cytotoxicity and lower off-target damage (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>). In addition to the long path lengths of &#946;-particle radionuclides, <sup>131</sup>I has the disadvantage of relatively lower linear energy transfer (LET) and generation of hydroxyl free radicals as a mechanism for DNA damage, causing upregulation of superoxide dismutase and resistance to radiotherapy (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 14, 16</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clear promise of alpha radionuclide therapy, there are several issues with alpha particle therapy. One of the most important is the short half-life of 7.2 hours for <sup>211</sup>At which limits long distance usage and shipment. In addition, in studies of long-lived alpha emitters, daughter isotopes can lead to toxic effects. However, with the straightforward decay scheme of <sup>211</sup>At, this is unlikely to be a serious problem. Alpha particles are dangerous if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through a wound but have no significant external exposure hazard. When they do interact with biological material, they are very damaging because of their relatively large mass and double charge. Specific targeting, rapid clearance from normal tissues, and minimization of retention of radiopharmaceuticals in healthy nontargeted tissues is of utmost importance.</p><p>
<sup>211</sup>At is a short-lived (7.2 hours half-life) &#945; emitter and is an attractive radiotherapeutic due to the absence of long-lived &#945;-emitting daughters and has considerably more potency and focused cytotoxicity than <sup>131</sup>I (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>). Both <sup>211</sup>At and <sup>131</sup>I are radiohalogens, hence similar radiochemical strategies can be used to conjugate these isotopes onto a benzylguanidine moiety (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 19&#8211;21</xref>). Meta-[<sup>211</sup>At]astatobenzylguanidine ([<sup>211</sup>At]MABG) demonstrates similar physicochemical properties to [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG, and shows NET-specific uptake into neuroblastoma cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>[<sup>211</sup>At]MABG showed potent antitumor effect in preclinical studies with malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 21, 23</xref>). The cytotoxicity of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG expressed as bound atoms/cell was nearly 1,400 times higher than [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell lines (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Finally, mAbs labeled with <sup>211</sup>At demonstrated antitumor activity with limited toxicity in phase I clinical trials (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25, 26</xref>). Together, these data supported the preclinical work here that further develops [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG for high-risk neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human-derived neuroblastoma cell lines (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were obtained from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cell line bank, the Children's Oncology Group, or ATCC and were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone), 2 mmol/L <sc>l</sc>-Glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin at 37&#176;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Animals were monitored for a maximum of 6 months or until death or euthanized when they lost &gt;20% weight or exhibited other signs of distress. Before therapy, at approximately 3 weekly intervals after therapy (until parameters returned to baseline levels) and at the time of sacrifice, blood was drawn from the retrorobital vein for hematologic parameters and renal and hepatic chemistry.

[211At]MABG delays tumor progression in a minimal residual disease model of neuroblastoma. A, Bioluminescence images of NSG mice injected intravenously via tail vein with 1 &#215; 106 IMR-05NET/GFP/LUC cells. Briefly, 1 million IMR-05NET/GFP/LUC neuroblastoma cells were injected via tail vein into NSG mice at day 0 and intraperitoneal injections of four fractionated doses of [211At]MABG. 12.9 MBq/kg/fraction (0.35 mCi/kg) over 11 days were started from day 5 along with thyroid protective SSKI drops (1 mg/kg). Each column represents one mouse and each row represents timepoints, as indicated. Shown here are 10 mice from the vehicle group and only 10 representative mice (of n = 19) from [211At]MABG treated group. Subsequent empty spaces represent mice that had reached tumor endpoint. B, Violin plots show the distribution of total flux (photons/second) integrated over the region of interest among vehicle (n = 10) and [211At]MABG treated group (n = 19) during the course of these studies. Data analysis was done for all the mice enrolled in the vehicle (n = 10) and treated group (n = 19) even though only 10 representative mice in treatment are shown here. [211At]MABG treated group shows decreased dissemination of tumor cells as compared with controls. C, Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curve for vehicle and [211At]MABG treated group is shown.

The currently available targeted radiotherapeutic [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG is a NET ligand that is rapidly internalized and has impressive single-agent activity in the relapsed and/or refractory setting (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 7, 40&#8211;43</xref>), and is now being studied in newly diagnosed patients (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT03126916">NCT03126916</ext-link>). However, responses to [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG therapy are often transient due to reemergence of disease that likely was not targeted because of small metastatic clusters or single cells in the bone marrow compartment that would not sustain lethal DNA damage by the long pathlength beta particles emitted by <sup>131</sup>I. This is the first study that we are aware of that attempts to address this issue with [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG in a disseminated neuroblastoma xenotransplatation model.</p><p>Alpha particles have the potential to overcome this limitation due to short path lengths and high LET. Here we show that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG have very similar biodistribution patterns and concentration in neuroblastoma xenografts, confirming prior reports (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24, 44</xref>). Previous studies have shown that a potential problem in delivering [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG is the deastatination of <sup>211</sup>At-labeled compounds due to the relatively low strength of the carbon-astatine bond (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24, 45, 46</xref>). However, <sup>211</sup>At has been shown to be safe in two clinical trials to date (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25, 47</xref>). Results indicate no dose-limiting toxicities. On the basis of our biodistribution studies and toxicity studies, we predict that the radionuclide will be well tolerated because there was no concerning emesis, diarrhea, or significant weight loss noted in the mice treated with [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG. The weight loss noted was transient with quick recovery to baseline. This is not surprising given the short path length of the alpha particle and the expected turnover of the gut mucosa. Most of the intraluminal alpha particles will irradiate only the mucus lining of the gut and those that do irradiate the underlying cells will likely have limited if any effect due to turnover. We also showed that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG is approximately 3 log more potent than [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Finally, we showed that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG has antitumor activity at least equivalent to [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in the short term; longer term efficacy might be realized by repetitive dosing or by combination therapy with [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. We also show that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG can prolong survival in a model that simulates microscopic disseminated disease. It must be emphasized that we are not seeking to show that [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG is the superior radionuclide of the two, but to provide a complementary radionuclide to add to the existing gains noted with [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG in the relapsed/refractory setting. Taken together, these data support the development of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG as a complementary targeted radiotherapeutic for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.</p><p>Much of the initial data with [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG in this disease was generated well over a decade ago. Logistical difficulties precluded IND-enabling studies as very few cyclotrons are capable of producing <sup>211</sup>At. However, there is now significant momentum and clinical proof of concept of the utility of alpha emitting radiotherapy for cancer (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48&#8211;50</xref>). We plan to develop a phase I/IIb clinical trial in which patients with neuroblastoma will be first treated with four fractions of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG, followed by a combination of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG depending on the response to [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG. Our work has shown the tolerance and efficacy of fractionated [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG as opposed to a single administration and therefore we propose the usage of four fractions of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG and assessment of response. The clinical, radiological, and bone marrow response of fractionated [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG will be integral in determining the tolerance and need for subsequent combinatorial [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG and [<sup>131</sup>I]MIBG. This will be an investigator initiated, single institution, phase I, dose-escalation trial of [<sup>211</sup>At]MABG in relapsed or primary refractory neuroblastoma that is [<sup>123</sup>I]MIBG avid. We plan to use the rolling six phase I trial design for the conduct of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="supp101" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ccr-22-0400_figure_s1_supps1.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp102" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ccr-22-0400_figure_s2_supps2.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp103" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ccr-22-0400_figure_s3_supps3.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp104" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ccr-22-0400_figure_s4_supps4.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp105" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ccr-22-0400_supplementary_figure_legends_s1_suppsl1.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants R35 CA220500 (J.M.
