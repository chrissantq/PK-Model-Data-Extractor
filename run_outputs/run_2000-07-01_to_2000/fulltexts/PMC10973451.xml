We investigated whether this change occurs in astronauts after at least 3 months onboard the International Space Station (ISS). We further explored the associations with diet, physical activity (PA), and body composition. Before and during spaceflight, respiratory quotient (RQ), carbohydrate, and fat oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry before and following a standardized meal in 11 males (age&#8201;=&#8201;45.7 [SD 7.7] years, BMI&#8201;=&#8201;24.3 [2.1] kg&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;</sup>&#178;). Postprandial substrate use was determined by 0-to-260&#8201;min postprandial incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of nutrient oxidation and the difference between maximal postprandial and fasting RQ (&#916;RQ). Food quotient (FQ) was calculated from diet logs. Fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were measured by hydrometry and PA by accelerometry and diary logs. Spaceflight increased fasting RQ (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.01) and carbohydrate oxidation (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.04) and decreased fasting lipid oxidation (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). An increase in FQ (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) indicated dietary modifications onboard the ISS. Spaceflight-induced RQ changes adjusted for ground RQ correlated with inflight FQ (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). In postprandial conditions, nutrient oxidation and &#916;RQ were unaffected on average. Lipid oxidation changes negatively correlated with FFM changes and inflight aerobic exercise and positively with FM changes. The opposite was observed for carbohydrate oxidation. &#916;RQ changes were negatively and positively related to FM and FFM changes, respectively. In conclusion, fasting substrate oxidation shift observed during spaceflight may primarily result from dietary modifications. Between-astronaut variability in postprandial substrate oxidation depends on body composition changes and inflight PA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Physiology</kwd><kwd>Biological techniques</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Microgravity leads to numerous physiological alterations, including dysfunctions of metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Because metabolism is at the crossroads of multiple physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> such as cardiovascular and musculoskeletal functions, it can affect astronauts&#8217; performance and health. However, the consequences of several months of spaceflight on nutrient metabolism are poorly known.</p><p id="Par3">Space model analogs on Earth, i.e., the head down tilt bedrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, showed in healthy male and female adults that 7, 42, 60, and up to 90 days of exposure to simulated microgravity induces a shift in substrate utilization characterized by a decrease in fat oxidation in favor of the use of carbohydrates as fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This was observed in both fasting and postprandial states, and so far, it has been seen as independent of changes in body composition and diet. Bedrest studies also showed that microgravity reduces the shift from fat oxidation in the fasting state to the preferential use of carbohydrates as fuel following meal consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In a 21-day bedrest study, we also showed that the latter preceded the onset of glucose intolerance in the pathophysiological context of insulin resistance in healthy men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This change in substrate oxidation, with other metabolic adaptations induced by microgravity, is part of the metabolic alterations observed in people with chronic metabolic pathologies such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It is, therefore, important to determine whether a change in substrate oxidation develops in space, which has never been done before.</p><p id="Par4">Changes in substrate oxidation in response to actual microgravity in space may differ from what was observed under simulated microgravity conditions using space model analogs on Earth. Indeed, all astronauts are asked to observe an exercise training protocol aiming to mitigate the microgravity-induced body alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and no true control (no exercise) group exists in space. This being said, a combined aerobic and resistance exercise training protocol similar to the one applied on the International Space Station (ISS) only partially prevented the shift in substrate oxidation towards carbohydrate use in both fasting and postprandial states during a 2-month bedrest study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is also important to note that a wide between-subject variability in body composition and energy metabolism in response to a 3-to-5-month spaceflight was recently reported in the ENERGY experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, with ground physical activity and inflight exercise being major factors in this variability. Similar inter-individual variations may exist in the nutrient metabolism response.</p><p id="Par5">In addition to investigating the relationships of energy expenditure, energy intake, and body composition with the physical exercise countermeasure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the ENERGY experiment included a one-day metabolic test combining fasting and post-meal responses in substrate oxidation. This study aimed to determine whether a shift in substrate oxidation developed in space, both in the fasting state and after a mixed meal, as reported during bedrest studies. We also used the wide between-subject variability observed in the ENERGY experiment to examine the associations with diet, physical activity, and body composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects&#8217; ground characteristics</title><p id="Par6">At baseline (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), astronauts had a mean age of 45.7 years (SD 7.7), were normal-weight with a mean BMI of 24.3&#8201;kg.m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> (SD 2.1), and presented a normal-to-high FFMI (19.6&#8201;kg&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> [SD 1.9]).

As for anthropometric data, a high inter-individual variability in the adherence to the exercise prescription was noted, with time spent in aerobic exercise ranging from 87 to 258&#8201;min.week<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and the number of repetitions on the ARED ranging from 468 to 3044 per week.

The effects of exposure to microgravity on energy expenditure and body composition during the ENERGY study were previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The present study reported the effects on nutrient use estimated in the fasting state and in response to a standardized mixed meal. As it has been repeatedly reported in bedrest studies for the past 30 years, a shift in total substrate use in favor of carbohydrates and detriment to lipid oxidation was observed in space. However, dietary intake changes appeared to be the main factor in this shift. Contrary to what was observed in response to simulated microgravity on Earth, there was no decrease in postprandial &#8710;RQ. However, because of the wide inter-individual variability seen on the ground and, to a lesser extent, inflight, associations between changes in post-breakfast nutrient oxidation and both changes in body composition and inflight exercise performance could be found.</p><p id="Par17">Four bedrest studies in healthy adults ranging in duration from 7 to 90 days have shown that simulated microgravity induces a shift in nutrient oxidation that favors the use of carbohydrates as fuel in fasting and fed states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This shift was noticed under conditions of positive, stable, and negative energy balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting that it was unrelated to energy balance. However, it was prevented by high volumes of exercise, at least partially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For instance, a 60-day bedrest study reported that an average of 30&#8201;min.day<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise combined with an average of 12&#8201;min/day of resistive exercise significantly mitigated the increase in fasted and postprandial non-protein respiratory quotient (NPRQ) induced by strict bedrest in healthy women adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the present study, astronauts self-reported on average 24&#8201;min.day<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of aerobic exercise using both the T2 and CEVIS devices and 1481 repetitions per week using the ARED device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which is approximately equivalent to 29&#8201;min.day<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of resistive exercise. Despite engaging in volumes of exercise roughly equivalent to those tested on the ground, the exercise countermeasure was insufficient to prevent the shift in nutrient use during the spaceflight. This may be because microgravity and/or physical inactivity are not the primary determinants of the shift in nutrient use. Using dietary surveys, we estimated a rough increase in carbohydrate intake from 43% of energy intake in the habitual diet of the astronauts on the ground to 50% of energy intake inflight. A concomitant approximate decrease in fat intake from 34% to 30% of energy intake was estimated. Recently, P&#233;ronnet and Haman extensively reviewed the relationship between intrinsic substrate oxidation, energy balance, FQ, and fasting RQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. They discussed how fasting RQ intra- and inter-subject variabilities may be related to various factors that are difficult to control and not fully identified. Among these, fasting RQ is known to be influenced by energy balance and diet macronutrient composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In a study that aimed to determine the variability and determinants of resting RQ in trained cyclists, a multivariate analysis showed that 59% of the variance in fasting RQ was explained by type I muscle fiber content, muscle glycogen content, training volume, plasma free fatty acid and lactate concentration, and the percentage of dietary fat intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We observed that 90% of the variations observed in the changes in fasting RQ induced by the spaceflight were related to inflight nutritional intake along with baseline RQ. This observation suggests that individual oxidative capacity and changes between ground and inflight diets, primarily drive the spaceflight-induced shift in substrate use. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that digestion and/or assimilation of nutrients may be affected by microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and that the dependence of fasting RQ on FQ may be different in space and on the ground. Muscle biopsies collected before and after the flight would have helped determine whether the structural, functional, and molecular adaptations widely described in studies of prolonged bedrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> also participate in the variation of inflight fasting substrate oxidation, like what was observed in the trained cyclists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Of note, decreases in type I muscle fibers have been repeatedly observed in animals spending between 11 and 91 days in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and in men and women bedrested from 55 to 84 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Without blood samples and muscle biopsies, we cannot exclude the role of muscle oxidative capacity alteration in response to microgravity. Together, these data suggest that inflight diet may predict the shift in substrate use observed during spaceflight more than microgravity per se.</p><p id="Par18">In this study, we also assessed substrate use in response to a standardized, moderately high-fat and high-protein mixed meal that allowed the reproduction of the dynamic processes of absorption and digestion of complex foods and the use of mixed substrates. We showed that postprandial &#8710;RQ was unchanged after 3&#8211;5 months of exposure to microgravity.

Given that the changes in basal substrate oxidation are primarily explained by the dietary changes between the inflight diet, and habitual diet, one could question whether those dietary changes may have influenced the assessment of postprandial &#8710;RQ and/or the changes in postprandial &#8710;RQ. As far as we know, only one clinical research study has assessed the impact of diet on postprandial &#8710;RQ. By comparing the effect of two 6-week eucaloric diets (western vs. &#8220;healthy&#8221; diet) differing in carbohydrate (48% vs. 40% of energy intake) and protein (14% vs. 20% of energy intake) intakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, the authors showed that both fasting RQ and RQ measured in response to a high-fat mixed-meal challenge (42% of carbohydrates, 51% of fat, 7% of protein) were lower in the group who consumed the &#8220;healthy&#8221; diet compared to those who consumed the western diet. However, the difference in postprandial RQ between the two groups did not persist after adjusting for differences in fasting RQ, which suggests no influence of the habitual diet on the postprandial use of substrates as fuel. In line with these data, we observed no relationship between changes in postprandial &#8710;RQ and inflight FQ (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that inflight diet largely contributes to the shift in fasting substrate oxidation but likely does not affect postprandial substrate use in astronauts, at least in response to a standard meal enriched in fat and proteins.</p><p id="Par19">We showed that flight-induced changes in postprandial substrate use were associated with changes in body composition and exercise. Changes in FM were positively associated with changes in postprandial lipid oxidation, while postprandial carbohydrate oxidation and postprandial &#8710;RQ were negatively correlated. A recent systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> that combined clinical studies on the relationship between adiposity and &#8710;RQ in response to metabolic challenges reported inverse correlations between &#8710;RQ to glucose plus insulin stimulation (i.e., measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and total FM, visceral adipose tissue, and waist circumference. However, the authors found no association between adipose tissue characteristics and postprandial &#8710;RQ in response to dietary challenges. Nevertheless, the systematic review only included nine studies, and none had longitudinal measurements of body composition, which may have precluded the detection of relationships with postprandial &#8710;RQ measured in response to mixed-meal consumption.</p><p id="Par20">Changes in &#916;RQ in response to mixed-meal ingestion were also positively associated with flight-induced changes in FFM. Although no relationship between the changes in postprandial &#8710;RQ and any physical activity variables was noted, inflight total FFM was previously positively associated with overall physical activity, time spent in vigorous physical activity, and T2 relative workload in these same astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is in line with previous data from our research group showing that habitual physical activity predicts variation in postprandial RQ on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, while decreases in physical activity concomitant or not with simulated microgravity favor the decrease in the shift from fasting oxidation to carbohydrates use following meal ingestion, the performance of combined aerobic and resistive exercise training prevented, at least partially, bedrest-induced alterations in muscle outcomes known to participate in postprandial &#8710;RQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, including decreases in mitochondrial oxidative capacity, whole-body oxidative capacity, and insulin sensitivity. Therefore, physical activity may modulate postprandial &#8710;RQ in space, similar to what was seen on Earth. These data collected on Earth and in space suggest that the relationship we observed between spaceflight-induced changes in FFM and postprandial &#8710;RQ may be partially mediated via the impact of the exercise countermeasure and/or overall physical activity on FFM. Because correlations cannot inform cause-and-effect relationships, we cannot rule out a reciprocal relationship. Some data point toward a potential role for altered RQ changes to metabolic challenge in the control of muscle mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Finally, the negative association previously observed in the ENERGY experiment between inflight overall exercise and inflight FM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> further suggests that physical activity/exercise may also affect the metabolic response to spaceflights via changes in FM.</p><p id="Par21">To date, among the four bedrest studies during which resting energy expenditure was measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, only one noted a decrease in resting metabolic rate, even after adjustment for changes in FFM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In the present study, average resting energy expenditure both unadjusted and adjusted for FFM remained unchanged after several months in space. In contrast, while no change was observed in diet-induced thermogenesis during bedrest studies, post-breakfast energy expenditure was significantly greater inflight than on the ground. It is possible that food processing costs are greater in space than on the ground. This may also be due to the changes in macronutrient utilization. During the flight, the utilization of carbohydrates that have a thermic effect of 5&#8211;10% increased to the detriment of fat that has a thermic effect of food of 0&#8211;3% only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Strengths and limitations need to be acknowledged. This is the first study to investigate substrate oxidation in astronauts during 6-month missions onboard the ISS. We used a standardized mixed meal as a metabolic challenge to assess changes in postprandial RQ under physiological conditions, unlike insulin stimulation or an oral glucose tolerance test, which create supraphysiological conditions. However, the relatively high proportion of both fat and proteins in the test meal did not allow for testing postprandial &#8710;RQ to carbohydrate and assess its relationship with insulin sensitivity. Other limitations include the relatively small sample size due to the challenges inherent to inflight experiments, the fact that only male astronauts were included, and the use of averaged urinary nitrogen excretion measured in astronauts during previous flights. Although the assessment of the inflight diet&#8217;s macronutrient composition was reliable, assessing the astronauts&#8217; habitual diet on the ground was challenging due to their hectic schedules. As a consequence, valid data were obtained for only seven astronauts. While precautions were implemented throughout the flight to control environmental and technical factors that could affect indirect calorimetry measurements, these factors may still have influenced the inflight values.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, we showed that, as observed during bedrest studies, spaceflight is associated with a shift in substrate use in favor of carbohydrate oxidation. However, rather than being primarily caused by microgravity, it might be predominantly driven by the macronutrient composition of the inflight diet. Whereas no change was detected on average, the considerable between-astronaut variability in postprandial substrate use highlighted the influence of both body composition and inflight aerobic exercise on these metabolic outcomes. These data support the importance of maintaining stable FM and, hence, energy balance during spaceflight. Additionally, they support the role of physical activity in the regulation of postprandial substrate use in space and that, provided compliance is maintained, the exercise countermeasure as it is currently prescribed might prevent the emergence of disruptions in substrate use. Because substrate use affects metabolic health and probably other physiological systems, future research will need to optimize dietary and exercise treatments for the long-term space missions foreseen for planetary exploration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par24">Eleven male astronauts from eight countries (United States, Japan, Italy, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and The Netherlands), who flew for six months onboard the ISS, voluntarily participated in the ENERGY experiment.

Subjects were connected to the PFS by a custom-designed two-way non-rebreathing valve coupled to a mixing reservoir for expired gases. The PFS uses a photo-acoustic method for CO<sub>2</sub> analysis (operating range from 0&#8211;12%) and an Oxigraf<sup>TM</sup> model X2004 sensor (Oxigraf, Mountain View, CA), a laser diode absorption spectroscopy sensor, to measure O<sub>2</sub> (operating range from 0&#8211;100% O<sub>2</sub> with a resolution of 0.01%). A differential pressure flowmeter (pneumotach; range 0&#8211;900&#8201;L.min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) is used for ventilation measurement on the inspired side of the non-rebreathing valve rather than on the expired side. Indeed, the decrease in contamination from moisture contained in expired gas usually relies on gravity, which obviously cannot work in space. Temperature, humidity, and inspired gas concentrations are measured on the inspired side of the respiratory circuit because inspired gas concentrations on the ISS slightly deviate from normal atmospheric values. A proprietary software package (DAC) was used to compute minute-by-minute VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory quotient (RQ as VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) from raw data signals measured by the PFS (VE, FeO<sub>2</sub>, and FeCO<sub>2</sub>) considering the delay time for the sensors to detect expired gas and the time shift to match the gas fraction data to ventilation. As inspired ventilation is measured, VO<sub>2</sub> is calculated using the Haldane transformation. All data are reported under standard pressure and temperature conditions, i.e., 1.013&#8201;bar and 0&#8201;&#176;C. Before each experimental session, the PFS underwent acceptance tests to validate instrument performance; the gas analyzer module was calibrated using reference gases, and the flowmeter was calibrated with a 3-L volumetric syringe. On the ground, a technician from the DAC calibrated the PFS and showed the participants how to proceed in space. To limit the effect on the measures of environmental conditions that differ on the ground and inflight, indirect calorimetry was performed in a dedicated room with controlled temperature at EAC. On the ISS, the PFS is located in the Human Research Facility Rack 2 of the Destiny Laboratory, which is isolated from the other living areas, and on the days of the tests, the other crewmembers were asked not to disturb the astronaut during the entire protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Energy expenditure and substrate oxidative rates</title><p id="Par31">For each of the eight periods of indirect calorimetry measurement (one in fasting and seven in the postprandial state), the first 5 minutes were excluded, and the stability of the data was visually checked.

Our statistical inference was based on the net changes between ground and inflight in fasting and post-breakfast energy expenditure, substrate oxidation rates, and RQ with their 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p id="Par38">Similar linear mixed-effects models accounting for repeated measurements were used to examine the associations of specific individual metabolic data (e.g., fasting and post-breakfast RQ and substrate oxidation variables) measured both on ground and inflight, as dependent outcomes with corresponding FQ values as explanatory variables. Multilevel mediation analysis was used to examine whether the impact of spaceflight on RQ was mediated by FQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">Then, general linear models were used to examine the associations between changes (difference between inflight and ground values) in RQ and in fasting- and post-breakfast substrate oxidation as dependent outcomes with successively (1) changes in body mass, FFM, FM, and physical activity, and (2) inflight exercise training (of note, no data were available for astronaut&#8217;s exercise training on the ground). Finally, the association between changes in RQ and inflight FQ, controlling for ground values of RQ (to indirectly account for ground FQ assuming that astronauts were in energy balance before the flight) was examined.</p><p id="Par40">Descriptive anthropometric, physical activity, and diet-related values are presented as means (standard deviation, SD). Unless otherwise noted, results of the linear mixed-effects models examining the impact of spaceflight on the different outcomes are presented as least square means (LSmeans) with their standard error (SE) or 95% confidence interval (95% CI). LSmeans estimated from models adjusting for FFM and FM were calculated using whole group mean ground FFM and FM values (63.77 and 15.59&#8201;kg, respectively). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) with a significance level of 5%. Figures were realized with Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, California).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par41">Further information on research design is available in the <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
