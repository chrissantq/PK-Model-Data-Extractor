to the current challenges faced by the increasing rate of drug-resistant
bacteria, attention is gradually shifting from synthetic antimicrobial
chemical compounds to natural products that are ecofriendly with a
wide spectrum of properties. The aim of this research was to successfully
fabricate electrospun nanofibers from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), PVA
blended with <italic toggle="yes">Bidens pilosa</italic> and chitosan
composite blends and investigate their potential antibacterial activities
against <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Fabrication of nanofibers
was performed by the electrospinning technique, which applies high
voltage on the polymer, forcing it to spin off as a jet onto a plate
collector. Characterization of the nanofibers was successfully performed
by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
Antibacterial assessment was carried out by colony forming unit enumeration.
The results obtained revealed a 12% increase in growth inhibition
of bacteria in composite nanofibers as compared with their parental
forms, which were &gt;91 and 79%, respectively. Chitosan nanofibers
have
been extensively researched, and their antibacterial properties have
been studied. However <italic toggle="yes">B. pilosa</italic> antibacterial
properties in a nanofiber form have not been previously reported.
These composite nanofibers open new avenues toward using natural materials
as potent antibacterial agents.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b00204</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao-2019-00204p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite
the modern technological advancements in biomedical research,
disease outbreaks caused by bacterial infections continue to claim
lives and cause uncertainty to humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The rate of
microbial resistance is rising dangerously around the world and endangering
man, plants, and animals in equal measure. This threat has complicated
the development of new conventional chemical compounds, resulting
in the decline in research and development for new antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Bacterial infection is a common occurrence in the world and especially
in remote areas where modern medicare is hard to get.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The recent advances in nanotechnology have provided a modicum
of hope to cope with the fears caused by looming bacterial outbreaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Materials at the nanoscale exhibit properties
that are not seen or believed to exist in the bulk scale of the same
materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Nanotechnology and nanomaterials
have been in existence for long time, for example silver and silver
nanoparticles were some of the first antimicrobial materials used
extensively in the ancient world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Until today,
silver remains a potent antimicrobial agent that is commonly added
to cosmetics and shampoos to prevent infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Although the newly discovered nanomaterials may have individual
antibacterial properties, focus is now being switched to composite,
biodegradable materials with synergistic effect against microbial
infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Development of nanocomposites
has been inspired by the challenges and limitations encountered when
using microcomposites and monolithic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Although they pose challenges in preparation due to the
stoichiometric limitations in the nanophase, nanocomposites generally
offer superior and user-friendly properties when compared with the
microcomposites and monoliths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Nanocomposite
materials are reputed to be materials of the 21st century owing to
uniqueness in property combinations, which are rarely found in conventional
materials. Development of nanofibers and their applications in various
fields have attracted tremendous attention from the scientific community
in the last decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> This is due to the unique novel
properties that come with reduction in size toward the nanoscale,
and for the case of fibers, it comes with myriad benefits in both
environment and biomedical fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Nanofibers
have a large surface-area&#8211;volume ratio, an easily biofunctionalized
surface, and superior mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> These properties have made nanofibers versatile in applications
ranging from engineering to medical, environmental, and catalysis
areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p><p>Electrospinning is a technique
in which materials in a solution
form are subjected to high-voltage power supply to produce fibers
that are in the micro and nano size range. For the electrospinning
process to occur, the following parameters have to be considered and
carefully controlled: polymer solution, high voltage power supply,
and the distance from the spinneret to the collector plate. The mechanism
that leads to the formation of fibers herein is the stretching of
the solution as it attempts to drop off the needle tip. This stretching
is forced by the electrostatic forces that act on the polymer solution
as a result of a repulsion between the polymer molecules and changes
in the current. The solution is forced to pass through a narrow orifice
electrified by the applied voltage in the range between 10 and 30
kV, which charges the solution and leads to the formation of a tailor
cone, which then provides a platform for the jet of the material to
whip down violently toward the collector plate.</p><p>The goal of
this project was to synthesize poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA)/<italic toggle="yes">Bidens pilosa</italic> (BP)/chitosan (CS)
composite nanofibers and investigate the effect of solution electrospinning
parameters on the fabrication of these nanocomposites and their antibacterial
properties.</p><p>PVA is a well-known polymer because of its biocompatibility
and
biodegradability, and these novel qualities have made it gain enormous
attention in biomedical research for multiple applications ranging
from drug delivery to antibiotic development and scaffolds for tissue
engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Chitosan on
the other hand is also known to have strong antibacterial activity
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and
fungi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> It has attracted great attention
over the last 2 decades in biomedical applications given the novelty
chitosan has as pertains to its properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The mechanism of chitosan antibacterial action has been extensively
studied, and previous research has linked the polycationic nature
of the amine groups, in solution, to lowering the pH below 6.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> The cations in the biopolymer are therefore
believed to interact with the negative charges on the cell membrane
of microorganisms, leading to the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan
and thus affecting the physiological processes of the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><p><italic toggle="yes">B. pilosa</italic> (BP) is a herbaceous plant
commonly referred to as Spanish needle or black jack, originated in
South America, and widely distributed around the world being used
as a food and medicine in many communities in Africa, America, Asia,
and Oceania.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup></p><p>BP is a rich reservoir
of phytochemicals, which give it unique
properties useful in antimicrobial, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, anticancer, and nutritional applications. Research conducted
to profile the phytochemicals found in BP revealed that it contained
about 201 compounds, of which 34.8% are aliphatic compounds, 29.8%
terpenoids, 9.45% phenylpropanoids, 6.4%, aromatics, 3.9% porphyrins,
and 2.9% other compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Each part of
the world has adopted BP for different functions, for example, in
Africa, it is used for the treatment of wounds, diarrhea, influenza,
headache, stomachache, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In Cuba,
the decoction (boiled extract) of BP is used as a juice as well as
an anti-inflammatory agent and also in the treatment of diabetes and
asthma. It is also used as a medicine for conjunctivitis, otitis,
colic, and snakebites in China. In Central America, BP is important
in the treatment of eye infections and is used as a diuretic and hypotensive
agent. In Uganda, BP has been explored in the treatment of malaria,
wounds, nasal bleeds, and stomach ulcers. The list of applications
in the biomedical field is extensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Thus, in this work, the combination of PVA, chitosan, and BP extract,
particularly in the nanofiber form, is expected to have a synergistic
antimicrobial effect against different bacterial strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Solubility and Miscibility

care was taken to ensure that solution parameters were optimized to

of the sediment and solution of PVA:EXT revealed changes in the composition

contained slightly higher percentage of carbon and oxygen, meaning
that derivatives of these elements were evenly distributed, as shown

the amount of minerals was more in the soluble portion than in the

of Working Parameters on the Properties
of the Formed Nanofibers</title><p>Voltage was an important parameter
for the electrospinning process and influenced to a great extent the
morphological properties of the formed nanofibers. To be able to spin
the solution in the syringe to obtain fibers, an optimum amount of
the applied voltage is required to eject and sequester the liquid
material into fibers, which are then collected on the collector plate.
To study the effect of the applied voltage on the nanofiber characteristics,
a PVA:EXT (in situ) solution of 8% concentration was prepared and
a range of spinning voltages were used ranging from 16 to 21 kV, as
shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a&#8211;f.
At a voltage of 16 kV, nanofibers of PVA:EXT were smooth with no beads,
and this voltage was ideal for fiber formation in all categories of
material combinations. The diameter of the nanofibers in both PVA:EXT
ranged between 35 and 80 nm, and there was a narrow diameter distribution,
as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,b. As the voltage was increased to 18 kV, these properties changed,
whereas incidences of bead formation were observed and the formed
nanofibers generally appeared with fiber diameter inconsistency as
well as increase in the average fiber diameter. The range of nanofiber
diameter in both cases at 18 kV was found to be between 14 and 179
nm, which was nearly double the size of the fibers obtained at voltage
16 kV, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c,d. Moreover, as the voltage was increased further to 21
kV (as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>e), the fiber diameter was increased and there was a problem of wider
diameter distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>f) as well as incidences of electric discharge. These results
were consistent with the findings of Zhao et al. on the morphology
of electrospun polyacrylamide nanofibers. Diameters of nanofibers
for all parameters were analyzed using Image J analysis software and
plotted by using Microsoft Origin lab software version 8.5.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scanning electron

the properties of the formed nanofibers, especially bead formation

the solution flow rate from 0.8 to 1.2 mL/h. SEM images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> reveal the extent
of the impact of solution flow rate on the formed nanofibers. When
the solution flow rate was reduced to 0.8 mL/h, there was a shift
in the fiber inconsistence and bead formation in both cases. At a
solution flow rate of 1 mL/h, fiber formation was uninterrupted and
the fibers were smooth with negligible levels of dropping (as shown
in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). On the
other hand, when the solution flow rate was raised to 1.2 mL/h, there
were challenges similar to those associated with low solution flow

the solution is one of the key factors,
which determines the morphology of fibers that can be obtained by
electrospinning. The influence of the PVA:EXT concentration on nanofiber
formation is shown in the SEM images in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a,c,e,g. It was observed that the formation
of smooth beadless fibers increases on increasing the concentration
of the solution. At a concentration of 6% of PVA:EXT, fibers break
along with beads, which however improved to smooth beadless fibers
upon increasing the concentration to 8%. Moreover, as the concentration
increased to 10% (SEM image in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>e), fiber entanglement was observed, and at the concentration
of 12%, ribbonlike structures were formed (SEM image in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>g). All of these changes equally
affected the fiber diameters, which increased as a result from 34
nm for 6% to over 100 nm for 12%, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b,d,f,h.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>SEM images of PVA: EXT nanofibers electrospun

polymer was insufficient to maintain
a stable jet from the tailor cone to the plate collector, and the
breaks that resulted led to the formation of beads, as shown in the
SEM micrographs in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a for PVA:EXT. This low concentration is associated with the
increased surface tension, which cannot be overcome by the electrostatic
forces because of the low chain entanglement in the solution and high
solvent ratio in the solution. Yuan et al. attributed this scenario
to the lower viscosity and conductivity of the material at a lower
concentration as compared to higher concentrations. Thus, in the current
work, we have also observed that the viscosity of the solution increased
upon increasing the concentration of PVA:DBP/PVA:EXT as shown in the

the findings made by Xu et al. and Yuan et al. although with slight
differences, which arose due to current inconsistencies, molecular
weight differences in chitosan, and also disparities in syringe pump

the composite
nanofibers resulted into high swelling capacity and low weight loss.
This might possibly be due to the fact that cross-linking of nanofibers
might strengthen the interfiber bonding through either physical interaction
or chemical groups (hydrogen bonding) introduced by glutaraldehyde.
For swelling behavior, the presence of PVA, which is hydrophilic,
possibly increases the capacity of the fibers to take up water. Moreover,
introduction of amine groups from chitosan and glutaraldehyde enhances
the water uptake behavior of the nanofibers. These results were in
agreement with the findings of Kouchak et al., who studied water preservability
but using PVA-based nanofibers for tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> The principle of weight loss and swelling ability
is very important for the nanofibers whose purposed application involves
absorption of molecules while maintaining their intergrity. It is
worth mentioning that the composite nanofibers (non-cross-linked)
were selected for the antibacterial studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Chemical

work carried out by Nguyen et al. using polylactic acid
and CS nanofibers revealed high and sustained antibacterial activity
of the nanofibers. The increase in the antibacterial effects at the
nanoscale is linked to the changes in the chemical properties that
occur with reduction in size, thus exposing chemically active groups
that interact with the cell membrane of bacteria.</p><p>This nanocomposite
system and also the enhanced antibacterial activity
of the BP extract in the nanofiber delivery system have not been reported
in the literature. This is therefore an important discovery for biomedical
applications, especially for wound healing applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pure CS nanofibers could not be electrospun
from pure CS dissolved
in 1% acetic acid. This was due to the high viscosity and tension
created by the polycationic nature of CS. CS nanofibers were produced
when a lower amount of CS was blended with PVA and CS interacted with
PVA polymers, forming H-bonds and thus reducing the polyelectrolyte
effect. A blend of PVA&#8211;CS with a higher amount of PVA produced
a nearly defect-free mesh of nanofibers with fiber diameters ranging
from 30 to 150 nm. To form nanofibers containing the BP extract, the
blend had to have a higher amount of PVA and the fiber diameter was
found to be in the range between 25 and 200 nm. Although the crude
extract of BP resulted in challenges during electrospinning and dissolution
of PVA due to the presence of tannins, it provided smoother nanofibers
than the other category. Composites of either crude extract or distilled
BP on combining with CS produced mixed results. While it was easier
to form electrospun nanofibers with PVA:DBP:CS, it was difficult to
get substantial fibers with PVA:EXT:CS. In the cases where combinations
with CS yielded nanofibers, the amount of PVA in the mixture played
a crucial role. Increasing the amount of PVA in the mixture reduced
the formation of beads and thus produced smooth fibers. Blended solutions
were best electrospun within 24 h of mixing to achieve smooth fiber
formation. The mixing has to be followed with a rest period of 4 h
to allow any hanging particles to fully settle. When the antibacterial
tests of these different blends of composites were carried out against <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, it was determined that nanofiber composites (PVA:DBP, PVA:DBP:CS,
PVA:EXT, and PVA:EXT:CS) showed higher antibacterial properties (74
and 83, 69.8 and 81.4, 75.9 and 86, and 75.4 and 91% against <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, respectively) than their parental form. The broad spectrum of the
antibacterial activity of BP and CS composite nanofibers can be applied
in the biomedical industry to counter the increased threat of antibacterial
resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>PVA (MW 125&#8201;000,
