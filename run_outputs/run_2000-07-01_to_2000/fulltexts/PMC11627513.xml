</xref> The sudden and brief nature of myoclonic movements, typically resulting in movement of the affected body part, helps to distinguish it from other involuntary movements such as tremor or dyskinesia. Numerous methods have been used to classify myoclonus in humans according to body distribution (focal, multifocal, segmental or generalized), etiology (physiologic, essential, epileptic or symptomatic), or presumed neural generator based on electrophysiological testing (cortical, subcortical, segmental or peripheral).<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

Only 3 respondents identified possible triggers of the episodes including stress (2/3), touch (2/3), excitement (1/3) and sudden movement (1/3). Eight respondents believed the episodes had negatively affected the quality of life of the dog.</p><p>Diagnostic investigations consisted of blood tests (8), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (7), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis (3). Reported findings and comorbidities included mitral valve disease (12), Chiari&#8208;like malformation (7), syringomyelia (6), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (5), and otitis media with effusion (2). Thirteen dogs were receiving medication for comorbidities, most commonly gabapentin or pregabalin for Chiari&#8208;like malformation and syringomyelia in 6 dogs, pimobendan for mitral valve disease in 3 dogs, and cyclosporine for keratoconjunctivitis sicca in 3 dogs.</p><p>Medical management of the myoclonic episodes was attempted in 8 dogs. Levetiracetam (LEV) was prescribed for 6 dogs. In 4 of these dogs, the episodes completely stopped after initiation of treatment, whereas in 2 dogs there was partial improvement. Regardless, 5/6 dogs were reported to have a later progressive increase in the frequency and severity of myoclonic episodes. The perceived duration of effect of LEV generally was not stated. Two dogs received prednisolone, 1 in addition to gabapentin; in both dogs the episode frequency and severity decreased.</p><p>Generalized epileptic seizures were reported in 4 dogs. In 2 dogs, the onset of myoclonus preceded the onset of seizures by 20 and 22&#8201;months (seizure onset of 10&#8201;years, and 11&#8201;years 10&#8201;months, respectively). One dog began having seizures at 1&#8201;year of age and was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy; myoclonus first occurred 8&#8201;years later. In 1 dog, the seizures and myoclonic episodes were reported to have the same age of onset (8&#8201;years). In the latter 2 cases, the caregivers reported effective control of generalized seizures using zonisamide and phenobarbitone, respectively.</p><p>Fifteen dogs had displayed changes in behavior since experiencing the myoclonic episodes, in their caregiver's opinion. These changes included a perceived desire to stay close to the caregiver (7), being less playful (6), being more restless (4), sleeping more (3), a perceived desire to be on their own (2) and aggression towards people (1). No such changes were reported for 12 dogs.</p></sec><sec id="jvim17227-sec-0015"><label>3.3</label><title>Second follow&#8208;up</title><p>A response to follow&#8208;up e&#8208;mail was received for 15 dogs.

Seven dogs had a further increase in frequency of the episodes, including 2 in which the frequency previously had remained unchanged. Five dogs had a further increase in severity of the episodes, including 2 in which the severity previously had remained unchanged. Two dogs had since been prescribed LEV and shown a positive response. No dogs were reported to have developed GTCS. Six dogs displayed further changes in behavior, including 3 in which none had been reported previously. These changes comprised loss of house training (2), a perceived desire to stay close to the caregiver (1), restlessness (1), a perceived desire to be on their own (1), aggression towards other dogs (1), perceived memory loss (1) and obsessive licking of objects and self (1).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="jvim17227-sec-0016"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Most CKCS experienced daily episodes of spontaneous myoclonus affecting predominantly the head, with variable involvement of the thoracic limbs, facial features, pelvic limbs, back, abdomen, and neck. There was a tendency for increasingly frequent and severe myoclonic episodes over time, both in dogs that received medical treatment and those that did not. Provoking factors only rarely were identified, such as touch, stress, excitement, and sudden movement. The most frequent descriptive terms used by caregivers are depicted in Figure&#160;<xref rid="jvim17227-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

</xref> However, in the current cohort, GTCS were reported slightly less commonly (4/27 rather than 9/39). The rarity of provoking factors contrasts with some progressive myoclonic epilepsies described in veterinary medicine such as LD and feline audiogenic reflex seizures (FARS), in which reflex myoclonus in response to light and sound is a prominent feature.</p><p>Most dogs were reported to have displayed changes in behavior since the onset of myoclonic episodes (18/27). These changes most often involved being more attached to and dependent on the caregiver and less playful, although 3 dogs had a preference to be on their own and 2 tended to display aggression to other dogs. Restless or obsessive behavior, excessive sleepiness and perceived loss of memory also were identified. A similar spectrum of behavioral changes is commonly reported as a manifestation of progressive cognitive decline in dogs with LD. In Miniature Wirehaired Dachshunds with LD, late clinical signs (&gt;3&#8201;years after onset) included dementia defined as disorientation and memory loss with or without altered sleep/wake cycle and anxiety, loss of house training, and aggression towards people or dogs.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Similarly, Beagles with LD exhibited staring into space, decreased stress resistance, increased noise sensitivity, separation anxiety, decreased playfulness, reclusiveness, loss of house training, attachment to the caregiver, and aggression towards people or dogs.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>In a previous study,<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> only 2/39 CKCS showed signs of cognitive dysfunction consisting of staring into space, being less interactive with the caregiver, aimlessly wandering, and anxiety. It was speculated that these signs may not have been directly related to the myoclonus, and could correlate with a historical diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy in both dogs. Similarly, 2 dogs in our study had idiopathic epilepsy, of which 1 was reported to have behavioral changes. In contrast, however, most CKCS (18/27) developed signs consistent with cognitive dysfunction.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> Overall, dogs with behavioral changes were generally older (median age, 145&#8201;months) and had experienced the myoclonic episodes for longer (median, 25&#8201;months) than those without behavioral changes (median age, 129.5&#8201;months; median duration, 18.5&#8201;months). Although it cannot be excluded that some behavioral changes may have been related to concurrent age&#8208;related health problems such as undiagnosed orthopedic conditions, this finding lends support to the possibility of an underlying neurodegenerative disorder involving cognitive decline alongside progressive myoclonus.</p><p>Ten dogs were prescribed medication for myoclonus. Eight dogs with behavioral changes were prescribed medication, as opposed to only 2 dogs without behavioral changes. This difference could suggest that medication was more likely to be offered, or accepted, for dogs that displayed behavioral abnormalities alongside the myoclonus. However, in most cases it was not possible to determine the exact nature of the clinical signs at the time of the first prescription, which is one limitation of our study. Although an adverse influence of medication on behavior cannot be ruled out, most dogs reported to have behavioral changes did not receive any medication (10/18).</p><p>Levetiracetam was the most commonly prescribed medication. It has a unique mechanism of action among the more frequently used anti&#8208;seizure drugs (ASD). By binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) LEV is believed to inhibit presynaptic calcium channels and decrease neurotransmitter release.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> Levetiracetam is considered a useful ASD in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in both humans and animals, with high response rates reported in several veterinary epileptic syndromes in which myoclonus is a prominent feature, including LD.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">

However, later recurrence of myoclonus was common, progressing in frequency in severity and necessitating dose increases of LEV in some dogs. The specific period of time for which the effect of LEV lasted generally was not stated, other than the owners usually described any subsequent worsening as slow or gradual.

</xref> with refractory epilepsy. Alternative, or perhaps concurrent, reasons for decreasing seizure control may include an initial placebo effect or recall bias by the owners, natural progression or fluctuation of the epilepsy, pharmacokinetic alterations such as would occur with poor caregiver compliance, or other mechanisms of acquired drug resistance.<xref rid="jvim17227-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> Given the tendency for natural progression of the myoclonic syndrome described in both treated and untreated CKCS in our cohort, it is possible that the loss of effect of LEV over time is at least partly reflective of an underlying neurodegenerative process. It also suggests that use of LEV is unlikely to prevent progression of the disease but can provide effective relief of clinical signs in the early stages. Caregivers of affected dogs should be made aware of this possibility at the outset.</p><p>The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature and relatively small sample size. In particular, the number of dogs that underwent diagnostic investigation and medical treatment was low and the approach not standardized, and additional prospective case series ideally would be required to establish firm conclusions regarding outcomes. As with most questionnaire&#8208;based studies, recall by the participants may have included inaccuracies and been subject to bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="jvim17227-sec-0017"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Myoclonus in CKCS tends to increase in frequency and severity with increasing age. The proportion of dogs that had concurrent GTCS was low. Later&#8208;onset behavioral changes suggestive of cognitive decline are commonly reported. Although the number of dogs prescribed medication was relatively low, there often was an initial positive response to LEV followed by later deterioration. These findings support the possibility of an underlying neurodegenerative process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="jvim17227-sec-0019"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="jvim17227-sec-0020"><title>OFF&#8208;LABEL ANTIMICROBIAL DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no off&#8208;label use of antimicrobials.</p></sec><sec id="jvim17227-sec-0021"><title>INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC) OR OTHER APPROVAL DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no IACUC or other approval was needed.</p></sec><sec id="jvim17227-sec-0022"><title>HUMAN ETHICS APPROVAL DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare human ethics approval was not needed for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="jvim17227-supitem-0001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>
