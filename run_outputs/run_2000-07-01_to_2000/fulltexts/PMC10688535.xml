For this malignancy, there are several regimens of chemotherapy that have been accepted as standard, principally intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) and intravenous chemotherapy (IVC); however, there is no standardized method of treatment. Selected patients with MPM who are amenable to cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and are fit for surgery typically undergo resection with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).

The study design is a randomized, nonblinded, phase II clinical trial comparing multicycle IVC with cisplatin (CDDP) and pemetrexed (PMTX) versus multicycle bidirectional chemotherapy with IVC CDDP and IPC PMTX after optimal CRS and HIPEC with CDDP and doxorubicin. The primary endpoint is 2-year disease-free survival. The secondary endpoint is 30-day post-treatment morbidity.

The natural history of MPM is progression predominantly on peritoneal surfaces and very rarely outside the abdomen. Unlike patients with pleural mesothelioma, many patients with MPM have no known history of asbestos exposure. MPM is characterized by the peritoneal dissemination of metastases with mucinous or serous ascites early in the course of the disease. MPM collects in the omentum as well as dependent portions of the abdomen, such as the pelvis, retrohepatic space, and paracolic gutters. The small and large intestines may be extensively involved. However, MPM does not commonly involve lymph channels, venules, or distant solid organ parenchyma, for example, the liver or lungs. Most cases of MPM-associated morbidity and mortality result from intestinal obstruction and malnutrition. Prior to the 1980s, MPM was managed with systemic chemotherapy, and surgical procedures were reserved for palliation of bowel obstruction and ascites. Initial reports of systemic chemotherapy for MPM showed low response rates and poor long-term survival. However, more recent reports of findings in patients eligible for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) showed higher response rates to systemic cisplatin and pemetrexed (PMTX)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and a median progression-free survival of approximately 18 months<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>CRS plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for MPM</title><p>Since the 1980s, CRS plus HIPEC procedures have been utilized to eliminate all tumor visible to the surgeon&#8217;s unaided eye in several types of cancer, with the expectation that survival will be prolonged<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. CRS that achieves optimal excision of peritoneal disease (with residual nodules less than 2.5&#160;mm) in highly selected patients has been associated with survival that is significantly longer than that of patients undergoing suboptimal excision. A medial survival of ~5 years has been reported in retrospective series of CRS plus HIPEC patients, compared to a 1-year median survival for historical control MPM patients who did not have CRS<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. However, small-volume gross or microscopic disease often remains after CRS. Even though HIPEC was used, a majority of patients have abdominal and pelvic progression of disease after surgery. The high prevalence of residual/recurrent disease led investigators to evaluate protocols that would deliver long-term intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) to the anticipated site of recurrence. This regional approach can deliver high concentrations of drug which can penetrate less than 1&#160;mm of peritoneal tissue. Retrospective analysis of outcomes in patients who underwent CRS and HIPEC indicates that this approach may offer longer survival than systemic chemotherapy alone and appears commonly used in MPM patients who are appropriate candidates for surgery<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>HIPEC for MPM</title><p>HIPEC has been developed in response to challenges associated with the tolerability and logistics of multicycle long-term IPC. Initially, a normothermic solution of chemotherapy was used. Subsequently, intraoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (shown to be technically more acceptable) was integrated into the CRS treatment paradigm of peritoneal metastases in order to increase tissue penetration and cytotoxicity of the antineoplastic agent delivered<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Hyperthermia itself may be cytotoxic to tumor cells, based on established mechanisms involving inhibition of nuclear matrix-mediated functions essential to DNA replication, transcription, and repair<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, it is the combined antitumor effect of heat and IPC that serves as the basis for the widely practiced HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The advantages of HIPEC are that (i) it is given before postoperative adhesions develop, (ii) hyperthermia may have a tumoricidal effect<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and (iii) hyperthermia may potentiate the cytotoxic effect of selected chemotherapy agents, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, the drugs most commonly used in HIPEC<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The HIPEC approach has been further supported by data from a randomized trial in patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal or appendiceal origin<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. That study demonstrated a survival benefit associated with CRS-HIPEC compared to systemic chemotherapy and palliative surgery when necessary (median survival 22.3 vs. 12.6, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.032).</p><p>CRS-HIPEC has become the most widely used treatment for resectable MPM<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, despite routine use of CRS-HIPEC, recurrence, most frequently peritoneal, typically happens within 12&#8211;24 months. IPC and intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) have been used, though inconsistently, in the postoperative setting for patients with MPM. This consolidation approach after CRS-HIPEC has been associated with better long-term survival compared to historical controls<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. However, the effectiveness of HIPEC has not been prospectively evaluated, nor have the relative benefits of long-term postoperative IPC been directly compared with those of postoperative IVC. IVC is an appealing approach after CRS, as it is widely accessible to patients. In contrast, IPC requires a higher level of expertise at select specialty centers but can achieve higher concentrations of chemotherapy on the peritoneal surfaces, where the risk of relapse is highest. The primary aim of the proposed randomized trial is to compare multicycle IVC using cisplatin plus PMTX versus multicycle bidirectional chemotherapy with IVC cisplatin and IPC PMTX for efficacy and toxicity in patients who have undergone CRS-HIPEC.</p></sec><sec><title>IPC for MPM</title><p>Over the past three decades, IPC has been used for peritoneal metastases of various primary tumors, but no randomized trials have been conducted for MPM<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Initially, IPC was delivered via an intraperitoneal catheter placed at the time of cytoreduction<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This approach allowed high doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy to be delivered intraperitoneally with minimal systemic toxicity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although reports of outcomes after IPC were promising, concerns remained that the perfusion of peritoneal surfaces may not be uniform, because of the fibrotic reaction to surgical trauma, which can trap cancer cells. Theoretically, multiple cycles of IPC may allow for a greater cumulative tumor cell kill than a single cycle. However, IPC has proven to be difficult for some patients to tolerate due to pain, distension, and nausea<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, giving multiple outpatient cycles of chemotherapy is logistically challenging for many patients, who may need to travel long distances to specialty centers to receive treatment for this rare condition. Because of these considerations and the lack of prospective data, IPC has not been practiced widely in potentially eligible patients. Nevertheless, IPC is utilized at centers that have the infrastructure to support its use<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In randomized trials, multicycle IPC has been demonstrated to be superior to postoperative IVC alone after CRS for ovarian cancer<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, the findings of a randomized clinical trial in patients with metastatic colon cancer suggest that combination of CRS and IPC is associated with longer overall survival than best systemic chemotherapy alone (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27&#8211;0.96)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, a retrospective study of 129 patients who underwent CRS for MPM at a single center reported that patients who received IPC had longer overall survival on average (HR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12&#8211;0.67) than patients who did not receive IPC<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacologic rationale for IPC with PMTX</title><p>When PMTX was delivered intraperitoneally there is a delayed clearance of chemotherapy from the peritoneal fluid. The mean half-life of PMTX in the peritoneal fluid was 127&#160;min. There was a slow increase in plasma concentration with a mean peak level occurring at 60&#160;min followed by a gradual decrease during the next 30&#160;min and then a stabilization until the end of the experiment. The AUC ratio of peritoneal fluid to plasma was 40.8. In the 6&#160;h experiment PMTX concentration in the peritoneal fluid gradually decreased with 75% of the drug being absorbed over 6&#160;h<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>There is a significant increase (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.0001) in the AUC for peritoneal fluid concentrations after intraperitoneal administration. The AUC for peritoneal fluid PMTX represents a 20-fold increase in exposure for tissues at peritoneal surfaces with intraperitoneal administration. The highest tissue concentration of PMTX was in the kidney (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.0122). In the other tissues, except for the liver, intraperitoneal administration exhibited higher PMTX concentrations that the intravenous administration including tissues from the abdominal wall, diaphragm, and mesenteric lymph nodes. These differences were statistically significant for the mesenteric nodes and the abdominal wall (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.0036 and 0.0017)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>Another characteristic of PMTX that makes it a candidate for multicycle IPC is the lack of pain upon instillation and the absence of peritoneal sclerosis. It has been used in prior protocols with multiple intraperitoneal instillations. Even after many cycles of IPC administration, catheter access was unimpaired. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with multicycle PMTX have no digestive complaints or nutritional problems<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. PMTX is one of the few chemotherapy agents especially well-suited for long-term IPC treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Overview of study design/intervention</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is a multicenter randomized, nonblinded, phase II clinical trial of the relative efficacy of the two existing postoperative chemotherapy regimens for MPM. The target population for this study is patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for MPM. It will compare multicycle IVC with CDDP/PMTX and multicycle IPC/IVC with IVC CDDP and IPC PMTX after optimal or near-optimal (nodules no larger than 2.5&#160;mm) CRS followed by HIPEC with CDDP plus doxorubicin. Disease-free survival and the toxicity of treatment will be measured (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Diagram of prospective randomized trial of long-term intravenous cisplatin and pemetrexed versus bidirectional treatment with intravenous cisplatin and intraperitoneal pemetrexed.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="sp9-27-108-g001.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>CRS of all affected abdominal surfaces will be performed in the usual fashion. This will include, when necessary, excision of prior abdominal incision, peritonectomy, bowel resection, oophorectomy, hysterectomy, omentectomy, splenectomy, and cholecystectomy. After the surgeon determines surgical cytoreduction is complete, defined as no residual peritoneal tumor nodules greater than 2.5&#160;mm, intraoperative treatment with HIPEC will take place. HIPEC is by closed-abdomen or open-abdomen technique, per the surgeon&#8217;s discretion, for 90&#160;min in the hyperthermic phase (41.5&#8211;42.5&#176;C). The dose of CDDP is 50&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and the dose of doxorubicin is 15&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. After completion of HIPEC, the residual chemotherapy solution is removed. After irrigation is complete, the abdomen and pelvis will be examined. Any intestinal anastomoses will be performed as needed. During or immediately after HIPEC, the patient will be randomized to IPC/IVC or IVC. Fascia and skin will be closed in a standard fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>IVC arm</title><p>PMTX at 500&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and cisplatin at 75&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> will be administered intravenously for a total of 6 cycles every 3 weeks. An intraperitoneal port will not be placed in patients receiving IV chemotherapy. The peritoneal access would carry a potential adverse event but would not be of any possible benefit to the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>IPC/IVC arm</title><p>After completion of HIPEC, an intraperitoneal catheter or an intraperitoneal port will be inserted through the abdominal wall<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. At ~4 weeks after CRS and HIPEC when the patient&#8217;s condition is considered stable by the physicians, bidirectional chemotherapy will be administered. PMTX at 500&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> given intraperitoneally in 1&#160;l of peritoneal dialysis solution (1.5% dextrose) will be administered as rapidly as tolerated by the patient. Only after the IPC administration is complete, cisplatin at 75&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> will be administered intravenously. The delay in IV cisplatin administered is to allow the artificial ascites from PMTX to maximize. This facilitates the distribution of bloodborne cisplatin into the peritoneal cavity. This treatment is for 6 cycles every 3 weeks.</p><p>The rationale behind both IPC and IVC is that small-volume residual disease persists even after optimal CRS plus HIPEC, as evidenced by the majority of these patients who experience recurrence in the peritoneal cavity. If the patient has not received IPC/IVC or IVC within 8 weeks of CRS, the clinician is to determine if adjuvant chemotherapy will be administered. Regardless, the patient will remain in the study and will be included in the analysis, based on the intention to treat.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic/diagnostic agents</title><sec><title>Cisplatin</title><p>Cisplatin is commercially available in multidose vials of 50 or 100&#160;mg. It is prepared as a sterile aqueous solution containing 1&#160;mg of cisplatin and 9&#160;mg or sodium chloride per ml. Vials are stored at 15&#8211;25&#176;C (59&#8211;77&#176;F). Do not refrigerate. Protect the unopened container from light. Store in a carton until the contents are used. The cisplatin remaining in the amber vial following initial entry is stable for 28 days if protected from light or for 7 days under fluorescent room light. Cisplatin can be administered intraperitoneally or intravenously.</p><p>NOTE: Aluminum reacts with cisplatin, causing precipitation formation and loss of potency; therefore, needle or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with the drug must not be used for the preparation or administration of cisplatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Doxorubicin</title><p>Doxorubicin is commercially available in multidose vials of 10, 20, 50, 100, or 150&#160;mg. For preparation, add doxorubicin to a sterile solution or 5% dextrose and water for injection into the chemotherapy solution. Store vials at room temperature. Vials reconstituted to 2&#160;mg/ml are stable for 7 days at room temperature. Doxorubicin can be administered intraperitoneally or intravenously.</p></sec><sec><title>PMTX</title><p>PMTX (Alimta, Eli Lilly) is a commercially available medication with a complete description of the drug, clinical pharmacology, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions available in the package insert. The freeze-dried product is composed of PMTX and mannitol at a 1:1 ratio. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid solution may be added during processing to adjust the pH. Two vial sizes are available: 100 and 500&#160;mg. Each vial contains the equivalent of 102 or 510&#160;mg of PMTX. The vials contain 2% excess to facilitate withdrawal of the label amount from each 100&#160;mg or 500&#160;mg vial. The drug product is stable when stored at room temperature. Reconstituting the 100&#160;mg vial contents with a 2&#160;ml to 10&#160;ml sodium chloride injection gives a clear solution with a concentration of 10 to 50&#160;mg/ml. The reconstituted formulation is in the pH range of 6.8 to 7.5 and has been shown to be chemically stable for 72&#160;h at refrigerated or room temperature. Vial contents should be inspected for particulate matter before and after the drug product is withdrawn from a vial into a syringe. The concentrated solution cannot be administered without further dilution. For purposes of clinical administration, an appropriate quantity of the contents of the reconstituted vials must be further diluted as per institutional guidelines. After dilution, the shelf life of the product is 24&#160;h at room temperature. PMTX is not sensitive to light. Vials of PMTX contain no antimicrobial preservative, and they are single-use vials. Any unused portion of a vial may not be stored for future use, and unused portions of product in a vial must be discarded. PMTX is incompatible in solution with acidic medications or media and must not be mixed or administered simultaneously through the same infusion line. The infusion line should be flushed prior to the administration of any concomitant medication. PMTX is compatible with standard PVC administration sets and any IV solution bags. PMTX can be administered intraperitoneally or intravenously. Folic acid and vitamin B12 should be administered as per standard institutional practices 2 weeks before and continuously during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Carboplatin (if cisplatin is contraindicated or not tolerated)</title><p>Carboplatin is available as a 10&#160;mg/ml solution. When prepared as directed, carboplatin solutions are stable for 8&#160;h at room temperature. Since no antibacterial preservative is contained in the formulation, it is recommended that carboplatin solutions be discarded 8&#160;h after dilution. Carboplatin can be reconstituted with either sterile water for injection USP, 5% dextrose in water, or 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP in a vial strength/diluent volume ratio of 50&#160;mg/5&#160;ml, 150&#160;mg/15&#160;ml, or 450&#160;mg/45&#160;ml to produce a carboplatin concentration of 10&#160;mg/ml. Reconstituted solutions can be further diluted in 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% sodium chloride for IV infusion. Unopened vials of carboplatin are stable to the date indicated on the package when stored at a controlled room temperature and protected from light. Carboplatin will be administered according to institutional guidelines as a 30&#160;min infusion (standard protocol) or a 3&#160;h infusion (standard desensitization protocol). Complete details are listed in the package insert.

Patients with measurable disease on their first postoperative scans (3&#8211;8 weeks postoperatively, before initiation of postoperative chemotherapy) will be monitored for tumor progression at the 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months time points (+/- 30 days). Also, patients with no evidence of disease on their first postoperative scan will also be followed at the 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months time points (+-- 30 days), and the attending physician will review and confirm that the patient remains NED. Recurrence may also be determined pathologically. Though no postoperative biopsies will be required by protocol, an incidental, pathological confirmation of a clinically evident recurrence will be considered an event, regardless of scans.</p><p>The secondary endpoint is treatment toxicity. We will evaluate toxicity up to 30 days after completion of on-protocol therapy for any clinically significant Grade 3&#8211;5 complications. All patients included in the study will be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.</p><p>Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: (1) NED, (2) progressive disease, (3) early death from malignant disease, (4) early death from toxicity, (5) early death because of other cause, or (6) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).</p><p>All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria will be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients in response categories 3&#8211;5 will be considered as failing to respond to treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Patients in category 6 will be censored at the time of the last follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria for removal from the study</title><p>A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to his/her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. The investigators also have the right to withdraw patients from the study (see below). Should a patient (or the patient&#8217;s legally authorized representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts should be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. A final evaluation should be made at the time of the patient&#8217;s withdrawal. An explanation of why the patient is withdrawing, and an attempt is made to perform a follow-up evaluation. If a patient is found to be ineligible for the protocol as designated in the section on Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility (i.e. a change in diagnosis), the patient will be removed.</p><p>In addition, patients may be removed from the study if one or more of the following events occur:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Significant noncompliance by the patient.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient&#8217;s refusal to continue observations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decision by the investigator that termination is in the patient&#8217;s best medical interest.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unrelated medical illness or complication.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Loss to follow-up.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>If a recurrence is discovered at one of the designated assessment time points, the patient will complete all remaining exams for that calendar visit. However, if recurrence is discovered at a nondesignated assessment time point, the patient will complete scheduled blood work at the subsequent calendar visit.</p><p>A patient who withdraws consent to participate in the study (i.e. patient choice) will be removed from the study.</p><p>Should he/she so desire, any patient withdrawing from the study will still undergo the surgical procedure, performed as originally scheduled.</p></sec><sec><title>Biostatistics</title><p>This is a randomized, unblinded, multicenter Phase II clinical trial comparing efficacy and treatment toxicity between groups treated with IVC or IVC/IPC. Eligible patients will have completed an optimal surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC for MPM. Though individual toxicity and efficacy studies of IPC and IVC have been conducted, comparison trials of IVC versus IVC/IPC have not been completed. Response rates to IVC for MPM range from 30 to 40%; however, it is unknown if systemic chemotherapy offers a survival advantage after CRS. There is recent retrospective evidence that IPC is associated with better long-term survival compared to expectant management<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The secondary objective will be cumulative grade III and IV toxicity.</p><p>Currently, the collaborating sites estimate ~40 eligible patients per year. Based on current patient volume, we will need to randomize 53% of 120 patients seen over a 3-year period, for a rate of 1.78 patients per month. Sixty-four patients will be 1:1 randomized and stratified based on estimated volume of disease, CCR, and sex (see section 7, Table <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This provides ~40 events with a median follow-up of 2 years, and 80% power to detect a 25% difference in the proportion of patients {50% vs. 75%, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.5) with disease progression or death within 2 years of CRS, assuming a log-rank test and a two-sided type I error of 20%.</p><p>We anticipate a less than or equal to 4% dropout rate. If a patient does dropout, he/she would be included in the analysis on the basis of intention to treat.</p><p>The provision that pathologically proven recurrence is counted even if there is no evident recurrence on imaging may lead to a bias in the comparison. If one of the two treatments is more likely to induce symptoms necessitating a workup, recurrence is more likely to be identified. To avoid this potential bias, for the purposes of analysis the next scheduled scan date will be used as the recurrence date for pathologically discovered recurrences. If no scan was scheduled at the time of pathological confirmation, the date of the next CT will be used for analysis.</p><p>Morbidity will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. We will monitor mortality throughout the trial using statistical stopping rules. Specifically, we will stop accrual if there are two deaths within the first 15 patients, three deaths within the first 30 patients, or four deaths within the first 50 patients. If the true probability of death is 2.5%, the probability of early stopping is only 8%. This probability increases to 80% if the true mortality rate is 10%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Research participant registration and randomization procedures</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Research participant registration</title><p>Eligibility must be confirmed as defined in the section entitled Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Tables <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Randomization will be accomplished by the method of random permuted block, and patients will be stratified by the initial PCI (low PCI or high PCI), the CCR (optimal or suboptimal) and sex (male or female). Sealed, opaque, nonresealable envelopes containing the assignment form will be used. The Research Study Assistant will be responsible for executing the process for all sites. In patients randomized to arm B, a means for intraperitoneal access will occur prior to abdominal closure.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data and safety monitoring and protection of human subjects</title><p>The Data Safety and Monitoring (DSM) Plans were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.
