id="efs26970-abs-0001"><title>Abstract</title><p>EFSA asked the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their residues to deliver a Scientific Opinion on testing and interpretation of comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies for both new active substances and existing ones. The main aim of comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies of pesticide active substances is to evaluate whether all significant metabolites formed in the human <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system, as a surrogate of the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> situation, are also present at comparable level in animal species tested in toxicological studies and, therefore, if their potential toxicity has been appropriately covered by animal studies. The studies may also help to decide which animal model, with regard to a particular compound, is the most relevant for humans. In the experimental strategy, primary hepatocytes in suspension or culture are recommended since hepatocytes are considered the most representative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> system for prediction of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolites. The experimental design of 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3 (concentrations, time points, technical replicates, on pooled hepatocytes) will maximise the chance to identify unique (UHM) and disproportionate (DHM) human metabolites. When DHM and UHM are being assessed, test item&#8208;related radioactivity recovery and metabolite profile are the most important parameters. Subsequently, structural characterisation of the assigned metabolites is performed with appropriate analytical techniques. In toxicological assessment of metabolites, the uncertainty factor approach is the first alternative to testing option, followed by new approach methodologies (QSAR, read&#8208;across, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> methods), and only if these fail, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> animal toxicity studies may be performed. Knowledge of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolites in human and animal hepatocytes would enable toxicological evaluation of all metabolites of concern, and, furthermore, add useful pieces of information for detection and evaluation of metabolites in different matrices (crops, livestock, environment), improve biomonitoring efforts via better toxicokinetic understanding, and ultimately, develop regulatory schemes employing physiologically based or physiology&#8208;mimicking <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> and/or <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test systems to anticipate the exposure of humans to potentially hazardous substances in plant protection products.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short" id="efs27033-abs-0002"><p>This publication is linked to the following EFSA Supporting Publications article: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2021.EN-6989/full" ext-link-type="uri">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2021.EN-6989/full</ext-link>

An explanation shall be given or further tests shall be carried out where a metabolite is detected <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> in human material and not in the tested animal species&#8221;.</p><p>In addition, the same Regulation defines that &#8220;The relevance of generating toxicity data in animal models with dissimilar metabolic profiles to those found in humans shall be addressed, if such metabolic information is available, and taken into consideration for study design and risk assessment&#8221;.</p><p>The scope of&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>&#8201;comparative metabolism studies is to assess potential interspecies differences in metabolism of a pesticide active substance. The aim is to ensure that all metabolites formed by the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> human material (e.g., human hepatocytes) are also present in, and thus covered by, one or more of the animal species used in toxicological studies. When a metabolite is present only in human material &#8220;an explanation shall be given or further tests shall be carried out&#8221; to assess its toxicological relevance. The same applies for metabolites in considerable excess in human material as compared to animals when deemed essential from toxicity point of view.</p><p>Currently no validated test methods are available to conduct these studies. Consequently, in the context of the toxicological dataset submitted for the approval or renewal of pesticide active substance, these studies are either conducted using different experimental layouts or in some cases they are not provided. Therefore, this poses some challenges for the national authorities and EFSA when evaluating the studies received by the applicants during the peer review process of pesticide active substance.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> comparative metabolism studies are widely used for pharmaceuticals in various stages of development, from a new chemical entity characterization to a pre&#8208;clinical safety assessment and this knowledge could support the use of these studies in the pesticide context (FDA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, it became clear in the context of the EU pesticide peer review that further guidance on the minimum requirements in conducting <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> comparative metabolism studies on pesticide active substances and assessing related data would be needed (Outcome of the pesticides peer review meeting on general recurring issues in mammalian toxicology, EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition, following implementation of Regulation (EU) 283/2013, biomonitoring methods for human body fluids and tissues are required. In the absence of a minimal set of data on interspecies differences in metabolism, it could be very complex to address the question of using the metabolism data in rat as a surrogate of metabolism in human for biomonitoring methods.</p><p>In order to&#8201;set a common scientific&#8201;background among&#8201;all the stakeholders involved in the peer review process&#8201;(i.e., Applicants, European Commission, Member States, Pesticide Steering Network),&#8201;the&#8201;EFSA Pesticide&#8201;Unit&#8201;organised a workshop&#8201;in 2018 on comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>&#8201;metabolism studies in regulatory pesticide risk assessment.&#8201;An event&#8201;report&#8201;on&#8201;the outcome of the workshop&#8201;was published in 2019 (EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>).&#8201;The&#8201;workshop&#8201;indicated the need of&#8201;guidance&#8201;on how to perform these studies.&#8201;The discussion held&#8201;was used as foundation stone&#8201;for developing&#8201;the&#8201;current&#8201;project.</p><p>The&#8201;project&#8201;was therefore&#8201;started&#8201;with the aim to develop&#8201;an&#8201;EFSA Guidance illustrating the testing strategy that should be applied to&#8201;assess&#8201;interspecies comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>&#8201;metabolism, the&#8201;minimum&#8201;requirements that should be&#8201;met&#8201;in the testing protocol for the selected assays and interpretation of the study results.</p><p>During the&#8201;activity,&#8201;the European Commission&#8201;was informed about the status of the Guidance and commented that it would be beneficial to address not only the&#8201;problem formulation related to the identification of&#8201;human metabolites&#8201;not properly assessed by toxicological studies using laboratory animal species,&#8201;but also how to assess the identified human metabolites&#8201;from the toxicological point of view.&#8201;Therefore, to address&#8201;the second problem formulation (evaluation&#8201;of toxicological relevance of&#8201;human metabolites&#8201;not properly assessed by toxicological animal studies),&#8201;the&#8201;PREV Unit considered that&#8201;further experience&#8201;would be needed&#8201;and that the contribution of the&#8201;EFSA PPR&#8201;Panel&#8201;would allow further development of the activity.&#8201;This resulted in a Scientific Opinion of the PPR Panel as final output&#8201;offering the opportunity&#8201;to better engage with the European Commission by considering the possibility of transforming the&#8201;Scientific Opinion&#8201;into&#8201;a&#8201;Guidance document which can then be taken note by the Commission (as it has happened in the past).</p><p>The&#8201;Scientific&#8201;Opinion&#8201;will provide&#8201;scientific&#8201;advice on how to perform comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies and how to interpret the results in the context of pesticides risk assessment. This will&#8201;likely&#8201;contribute to&#8201;enhance harmonisation when&#8201;applicants&#8201;conduct&#8201;these studies and to&#8201;better support&#8201;regulators when evaluating the data,&#8201;thus&#8201;increasing consistency during the Peer Review process.</p><p>Therefore, EFSA requested the PPR Panel to develop a Scientific Opinion to:

This Scientific Opinion is tailored to the EU data requirement on pesticide active substances,<xref rid="efs26970-note-1001" ref-type="fn">1</xref> and therefore, the test item is used as synonym of the pesticide active substance. The comparison of metabolites formed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> should allow evaluation whether all metabolites formed in the human test system are also present at comparable level in pivotal animal species used in toxicological studies and therefore, if their relevance for human risk assessment has been appropriately addressed.</p><p>The experimental strategy outlined in this opinion is schematically presented in Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and aims to optimise the chances to detect all relevant metabolites, by minimising sources of variability and/or bias during the planning and execution of the studies. This variability is related to the specific and critical factors and conditions in the test system, test item, preliminary studies, experimental design of the main study, analytical matters and evaluation of results, i.e. all factors that can influence the amount of metabolite formed and therefore its analytical detection (see Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0006" ref-type="sec">3</xref>).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">a)</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">Test system and test item</italic>
</p><p>Primary hepatocytes from all animal species used in the EU pesticide active substance regulatory data package on mammalian toxicology (i.e. rat, mouse, dog and rabbit) and from humans are the recommended test system. Primary hepatocytes are recommended since human hepatocytes are considered the best surrogate for prediction of human <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolism (Obach et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0081" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) (see Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0007" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>). The recommendation of hepatocytes is consistent with the legal requirements for pesticides where use of &#8216;<italic toggle="yes">microsomes or intact cell systems&#8217;</italic> is cited. It reflects the latest and most appropriate state of knowledge and science.</p><p>Test item characterisation (e.g. radiochemical purity, solubility) together with determination of cytotoxicity in preliminary experiments is important element for concentration selection in the main experiment.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">b)</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">Preliminary experiments</italic>
</p><p>Regarding hepatocytes, cytotoxicity and metabolic competence are the most important pieces of information required before performing the actual experiments. Determination of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> clearance is useful for deciding whether long&#8208;term incubation in cultured hepatocytes is required to assess slow&#8208;metabolising test items.</p><p>Regarding the test item, it is of importance to assure that it is not excessively bound to plasticware or other non&#8208;biological materials in the system (see Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0008" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">c)</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">Experimental design of the main study</italic>
</p><p>The PPR Panel recommends to maximise the chances of identifying UHM and DHM by taking into account the test item concentration, incubation time and technical replicates in the experimental design (see Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0009" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref>). Metabolite formation from a test item is dependent on:
<list list-type="simple" id="efs26970-list-0004"><list-item><label>&#8211;</label><p> the kinetic characteristics of metabolising enzymes affecting the selection of test item concentration,</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#8211;</label><p> the length of incubation time affecting the sensitivity of detecting selective metabolites and</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#8211;</label><p> the number of technical replicates affecting the robustness of the measured metabolite amount.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>To limit the contribution of individual biological variability and having a response representative of the 'average' population, the use of pooled hepatocytes is recommended (see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C</xref> for further details). As a recommendation, a standard hepatocyte concentration of 1 million hepatocytes/mL is suggested, but dependent on the velocity of conversion this can be changed and ideally optimised (Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1001" ref-type="sec">A</xref>).</p><p>For the above&#8208;mentioned reasons, the design of 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3 (concentrations, time points, technical replicates of pooled test systems) would allow a reasonable setting to identify UHM and DHM, which may be less likely with simpler designs such as 1 concentration and incubation time (Whalley et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0138" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The study design includes also considerations on the applicability domain of the test (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0010" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>) and selection of species (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0011" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>), which may result in modifications of the execution of the actual experiments.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">d)</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">Definition of unique human metabolite (UHM) and disproportionate human metabolite (DHM)</italic>
</p><p>According to this Scientific Opinion, metabolites of concern are those that are unique to human, i.e. not detectable in incubations with test material from other test species, i.e. UHM, and those that are present in more than fourfold abundance at any sampling time point in human hepatocytes as compared with other species, i.e. DHM (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0013" ref-type="sec">4</xref>). The assignment of a metabolite as disproportionate may be challenging especially at abundance ratios close to a factor of 4, considering biological and technical complexity and variability. However, the 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3 experimental design (see above) provides ample experimental results and supports integrated analysis and decision&#8208;making.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">e)</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">Chemical Analysis</italic>
</p><p>Regarding the analysis of the incubates, test item&#8208;related radioactivity recovery and metabolite profile are the most important parameters in the first step. On this basis, the assignment of DHM and UHM is made. In the second step, structural characterisation of the assigned metabolites is performed with appropriate mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The scheme of metabolic pathways is an important part of chemical analysis and for further consideration of potential consequences (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0016" ref-type="sec">5</xref>).</p><p>

<italic toggle="yes">Toxicological assessment of metabolites</italic>
</p><p>For a DHM that has already been co&#8208;tested in <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> animal toxicity study with the parent compound, a pragmatic approach to avoid additional animal testing is to apply an additional uncertainty factor (UF) to the default UF (100), resulting in an overall larger UF for deriving a health&#8208;based guidance value (HBGV) for the parent compound. The default UF of 4 allows for interspecies difference in toxicokinetics, consequently the metabolite formed in quantities more than fourfold in humans compared to animal species is not covered by animal testing and would require an additional UF, the value of which is dependent on the relative quantity of the DHM in human and animal hepatocytes.</p><p>Due to current and developing toxicological assessment schemes employing new approach methodologies (NAMs) and adherence to the 3Rs principle, the hazard identification (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0024" ref-type="sec">6.2</xref>) would begin with the application of QSAR and read&#8208;across methodologies, and proceed to various <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> toxicological testing methods and batteries. If these approaches do not provide sufficient level of necessary information, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> animal toxicity studies, e.g. a 90&#8208;day rat study, could be considered. This step&#8208;wise approach is in alignment with earlier EFSA guidance documents and scientific opinions.</p><p>In case a human metabolite is not covered by parent compound and even if a limited toxicological database exists, additional UF can be applied for setting health&#8208;based guidance value for this unique human metabolite (Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0027" ref-type="sec">6.3</xref>). The additional UF may be determined by expert judgement on a case&#8208;by&#8208;case basis. It is also possible to apply an additional uncertainty factor for extrapolation of a low observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) to a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), or the data from the critical study may be modelled to derive a benchmark dose (lower confidence limit) (BMDL), which can then be used as the reference point (also referred to as point of departure) for the derivation of the health&#8208;based guidance value.</p><p>g) Recommendations for the future</p><p>Obviously, the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study can provide a significant piece of information to assess the potential role of metabolites of concern in toxicological risk assessment of a pesticide active substance. Additionally, knowledge of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolites in incubations with test material from humans and animal toxicology test species would add useful pieces of information for the toxicological evaluation of metabolites in different matrices (crops, animals, ecosystems, residues in environment). Improved understanding of toxicokinetics would support current biomonitoring efforts. Finally, comprehensive integrative regulatory schemes would benefit from physiologically based or physiology&#8208;mimicking virtual or <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test systems to anticipate and prevent the exposure of humans and ecosystems to potentially hazardous active substances in plant protection products (see Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0028" ref-type="sec">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="efs26970-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the structure and key points of the scientific opinion</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="EFS2-19-e06970-g001.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0006"><label>3</label><title>Study design and experimental strategy</title><sec id="efs26970-sec-0007"><label>3.1</label><title>Test systems</title><p>There are three principal prerequisites for the selection of an adequate <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system to compare metabolism of a test item between different species.

</p><p>In the pharmaceutical area, liver microsomes are a suitable choice for comparing the metabolite profile among humans and animal species, although they do not contain the whole metabolic machinery. This is because the final assessment of human metabolites relies on <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> human data (phase&#8208;1 trials; FDA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, in the area of pesticides, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> human data are rarely available, and therefore in most cases, the assessment of human metabolites can only rely on <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> data. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies should be <bold>robust enough</bold> to detect both UHM and DHM and should give the complete picture on metabolic pathways by using the most appropriate experimental test system, particularly important for interpretation of the results.</p><p>For addressing the <bold>first problem formulation</bold> of this opinion, i.e. to identify DHM and UHM, isolated primary hepatocytes, either suspended (for short&#8208;term incubation) or plated (for longer term incubation), are considered the best choice. Hepatocytes, as the main hepatic cell type, mimic intact liver in terms of most important biotransformation enzymes. Decades of experience exist in using hepatocytes in biomedical research and drug development, particularly for elucidating <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism, metabolite formation and clearance in drug development by the pharmaceutical industry. Cryopreserved pooled hepatocytes are commercially available. The human hepatocyte test system (plated hepatocytes) has been validated by EURL&#8208;ECVAM regarding Cytochromes P450 (CYP) induction (Bernasconi et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Hepatocytes isolated from different animal species, including rat, mouse, dog and rabbit have been used in research and drug development for a long time (FDA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Pooled primary hepatocytes are considered the most suitable model since they average out possible outlier in enzymatic activities and they contain the physiologically relevant expression of phase I and phase II biotransformation enzymes, appropriate concentration of the cofactors, and expression of transporter proteins.</p><p>Metabolites formed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> can be well predicted by using hepatocytes in suspension. The predictability of metabolites formed by subsequent reactions gives more uncertainty for decision&#8208;making (Dalvie et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This may be attributed to, e.g. the short incubation time that can be used with hepatocytes in suspension (maximum about 4&#8201;h, see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C</xref>). For such cases, long&#8208;term incubation test systems can be used (e.g. 24&#8201;h, see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C</xref>), for which plated hepatocytes are recommends in this opinion (Ballard et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kratochwil et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0067" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and if available, the results of long&#8208;term incubations are the basis for the assessment.</p><p>For addressing <bold>other follow&#8208;up problem formulations</bold>, such as formation of reactive metabolites or isoform&#8208;specific metabolism, microsomes, S9 fractions, heterologous expression systems or other suitable approaches such as chemical trapping agents might be suitable choices depending on a specific problem formulation.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0008"><label>3.2</label><title>The test item</title><p>The PPR Panel recommends to gather existing knowledge from the open literature (retrieved by means of the literature search, EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and/or additional databases (e.g. ADME data in US&#8208;EPA dashboard<xref rid="efs26970-note-1003" ref-type="fn">3</xref>, ECVAM databases<xref rid="efs26970-note-1004" ref-type="fn">4</xref> or OpenFoodTox<xref rid="efs26970-note-1005" ref-type="fn">5</xref>, see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1006" ref-type="sec">F</xref>) on the test item itself (when it is an existing one subject to renewal) or on structurally similar test items before the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study is conducted. Other information, e.g. on hepatic clearance, may also be helpful for selecting the test conditions, when a comparative metabolism study is designed.</p><p>In silico testing, such as QSAR analysis for metabolism prediction can facilitate the planning of the study by postulating the main metabolic pathways in humans and potential human metabolites, including primary and more distal metabolites (also called secondary metabolites, i.e. formed by a second or more reactions), but this information cannot be used as alternative to an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> study, and should be considered as supplementary information only.</p><p>In order to design the study in a proper way, information on the physical&#8211;chemical properties and characterisation of the test item are required (GIVIMP, OECD, 2018a).

The radiolabelled test item is administered to the animals and afterwards all relevant metabolites (present at &#8805; 5% of the administered dose) are identified in body fluid and tissues (e.g. plasma, serum, blood, urine and faeces) to provide a metabolic scheme for the test item. The PPR recommends that the radiolabel material used in the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study to be of similar composition than the one used in in the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolism study. The identification refers to the exact structural determination of relevant metabolites. The knowledge obtained with the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> rat kinetic study provides important insight into the potential major metabolites that could be formed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, as in general grossly identical metabolites are expected to be formed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (see also Section&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-0025" ref-type="sec">6.2.1</xref>).

In the rat <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK study, a general overview about the metabolism is gained and a tentative identification of major metabolites done. However, more detailed TK parameters such as clearance, half&#8208;life or bioavailability of metabolites are not possible to be derived, because of experimental design and unspecificity of the analytical method used (i.e. quantifying total radioactivity, not differentiating between parent chemical and metabolites).</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK study results on the test item may help to design and interpret the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study. As pointed out in OECD TG 417, the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> rat study provides useful information about the analytical method for parent and metabolites (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0086" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

If TK parameters could be derived from the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> study, they may contribute to constructing a PBK model for the test item and metabolites, which can be used to provide more insights into dose&#8208;dependent internal exposure to parent chemical and metabolites (see Section&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-0034" ref-type="sec">7.6</xref>). Comparison of metabolism between <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> rat hepatocytes and the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK rat study may be helpful to extrapolate the results of the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> human hepatocyte study to <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> hepatic metabolism and contributes to the acceptability assessment of the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study. However, there is very little published data on this potential. Regarding human metabolites, available studies indicate that the metabolite profile obtained <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> can reflect the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolite pattern, especially concerning primary metabolites (Anderson et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Dalvie et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Generation of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism data in laboratory animals and comparison of these data with <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK data for pesticide active substances provide the information how <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism data reflect <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolite profiles.</p><p>In the area of pesticides, according to EU pesticide active substance data requirements, another important source of information on metabolite formation are pesticide residue metabolism studies in livestock, the availability of which, however, depends upon the intended pesticide use.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0009"><label>3.3</label><title>Preliminary experiments</title><p>Before the comparative metabolism study is to be performed, the PPR Panel recommends to conduct preliminary experiments to assess (1) the cytotoxic potency of the test item to the test system, (2) the metabolic competence of the test system and (3) the non&#8208;specific binding of the test item.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">1) Cytotoxic potency of the test item to the test system</italic>
</p><p>Biotransformation enzyme activity can be reduced in chemical&#8208;induced stress and cytotoxicity situations. Therefore, comparative metabolism studies are to be performed at test item concentrations that do not affect hepatocyte function. Test item&#8208;induced toxic effects can be assessed by performing a cytotoxicity study as described in more detail in Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.1.1</xref>, allowing to establish the highest test item concentration that does not affect hepatocyte function to be used in the comparative metabolism studies. As toxicity can be caused by a biotransformation product (i.e. metabolite), it is of importance that the cytotoxicity studies are performed with metabolically active hepatocytes. Studies need to be performed with hepatocytes of all selected species, since species&#8208;dependent differences in cytotoxic potencies of the test item may occur.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">2) Metabolic competence of the test system</italic>
</p><p>Adequate functioning of the test systems would be needed to obtain relevant data on the test item&#8217;s metabolite formation. Such information can be obtained by assessing the time&#8208;dependent metabolite formation of well&#8208;known reference compounds, which can also be applied as positive control in the comparative metabolism study itself (more information is presented in Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1002" ref-type="sec">B.5</xref> and Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.1.2</xref>). Comparative metabolism studies should only be performed with hepatocytes batches with sufficient metabolic activity.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">3) Non&#8208;specific binding of the test item</italic>
</p><p>For the adequate interpretation of the data obtained in the comparative metabolism study, insight into the availability of the test item to the test system (hepatocytes) is essential. Especially for very lipophilic test items, non&#8208;specific binding, e.g. to plastic and/or medium constituents, may largely reduce the availability of the test item to the hepatocytes. More information on this topic is presented in Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.1.3</xref>.</p><p>Besides these preliminary studies, performance of a pilot clearance study can be helpful. Such a clearance study provides information on the velocity of the conversion of the test item, which can be used to estimate whether a short&#8208;term incubation would suffice to reach 20% conversion or whether a long&#8208;term incubation would be required. More information on such clearance studies is presented in Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0010"><label>3.4</label><title>Experimental design of the main study</title><p>Selection of the experimental test conditions for conducting the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study and application of well&#8208;defined acceptance criteria is critical to obtain robust and reliable data. The choice of, amongst others, hepatocyte concentration and culture medium have a large impact on intrinsic clearance values obtained with <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> hepatic studies as shown in an analysis of clearance data obtained with different experimental set&#8208;ups (Louisse et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Because intrinsic clearance in hepatocytes is practically wholly determined by metabolism, it can be expected that also with <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolite formation studies, experimental set&#8208;up influences the study outcome. The experimental design described in this Scientific Opinion is considered optimal to maximise the chances of detecting potential metabolites, particularly those which are formed with a slow rate of formation and therefore prone to be not detected, since occurring at concentrations below the limit of detection of the analytical method. Since the aim of such studies is to compare the metabolic profiles across species and to possibly identify also DHM (in addition to UHM), it is important to use the same experimental set&#8208;up, when possible, across species. By assuring this, the identified <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> species differences will not result from differences in experimental set&#8208;up but will reflect (differences in) biology. It is intended to minimise sources of experimental variability which would affect the comparison of metabolic profiles.</p><p>Although the design described below serves as an example regarded by the PPR Panel as a minimum option, it has to be kept in mind that pesticide active substances are a highly variable group of chemicals belonging to different chemical classes with different properties, and therefore, it is expected that a single design (or even a range of designs) does not fit all different test items.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">At least three concentrations</italic>: Concentrations of the test item have a significant impact on the detection of relevant metabolites. In the main experiment 3, concentrations are recommended: high, medium and low. One high concentration (e.g. 100&#8201;&#181;mol/L), which should not be cytotoxic (i.e. viability &#8805; 80% compared to solvent control), is recommended to maximise the chance of detecting metabolites that are formed via metabolic reactions with low affinity. However, at such high substrate concentrations, certain metabolic conversions may be inhibited, indicating that incubation with a lower substrate concentration is required (e.g. 1&#8201;&#181;mol/L) to allow formation (and subsequent detection) of metabolites that would be formed via these reactions. It is highly recommended to also include an intermediate concentration (e.g. 10&#8201;&#181;mol/L) as it would provide relevant insights into the kinetics of the reactions underlying the metabolite(s) formation, such as the concentrations at which metabolic reactions get saturated.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">At least three time points</italic>: In the main experiment, at least three incubation time points are recommended. An incubation period of 4&#8201;h is considered the maximum incubation time applicable with primary hepatocytes in suspension cultures, allowing the maximum metabolic conversion and formation of more distal metabolites. It is highly recommended to include at least two sampling time points (e.g. 1 and 2&#8201;h) (see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1008" ref-type="sec">H</xref>) to assess whether changes in metabolite levels are time dependent (indicating adequate functioning of the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system during the whole test duration). Furthermore, information on time&#8208;dependent changes in metabolite levels provides more insight into the kinetics of formation of primary and more distal metabolites, facilitating a better evaluation of DHM in humans compared to animals.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Three technical replicates of pooled test systems</italic>: It is of importance to perform three simultaneous incubations of each pooled hepatocyte preparation to address the variability of the assay protocol.</p><p>Depending on the outcome of the test, additional replicates, time points or concentrations might be needed to substantiate whether e.g. certain reactions are saturated. In addition, depending on the chemical properties of the pesticide active substance, such as solubility and cytotoxicity, chemical&#8208;specific optimal concentrations can be selected.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Slow&#8208;metabolised test item</italic>: To ensure that the test item has been metabolised and that metabolites are formed, the PPR Panel recommends to observe a minimum of 20% decrease of the concentration of the test item (and its related conversion into metabolites) at the end of the 4&#8208;hour incubation period in hepatocytes from all species. The proposed value of 20% takes into account several factors such as variability and method of analysis (FDA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In case no or limited metabolism is observed (i.e. less than 20% decrease of the test item), the PPR Panel recommends to perform a longer incubation of, e.g. 24&#8201;h in plated hepatocyte incubations to avoid that potentially unique metabolites are not detected due to slow conversion <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (Ballard et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kratochwil et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0067" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Based on available data (e.g. having data on structurally similar compounds or results from a pilot <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> clearance study), a long&#8208;term incubation could be immediately selected. For test items which are not metabolised or metabolised at very low rate, or for which the half&#8208;life is known to be shorter than 24&#8201;h, the omission of the 24&#8208;h incubation can be reasonably justified.</p><p>Detailed information on a recommended experimental set&#8208;up is given in Appendices 2 and 3.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0011"><label>3.5</label><title>Applicability domain of the test</title><p>The described experimental set&#8208;up in Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.3</xref> will not be applicable for all test items. For example, for a volatile test item, a closed system would be required to prevent evaporation and for substances that have a poor solubility in water, dosing in medium without proteins may cause problems, requiring a tailored study design. There may be cases in which, due to the knowledge on the physico&#8208;chemical and toxicological properties of the test item, a comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study does not appear scientifically necessary or testing for this purpose not technically practicable. Examples of such test items are some inorganic active substances (e.g. calcium carbonate) for which <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> testing is not needed.</p><p>For test items that are complex mixtures the recommendation is to test the most representative component(s) within the mixture, the selection of which is done on the basis of different criteria, including but not limited to, the results of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> ADME study or toxicity information (e.g. in silico methods or other NAMs, if available), as described in the EFSA Guidance on mixture risk assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).

For identification of UHM and DHM, the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies could be conducted by using human and rat hepatocytes in a first step.

This is based on the fact that the majority of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> toxicity studies in the EU pesticide active substance regulatory data package are performed in rats (from short&#8208;term to long&#8208;term toxicity as well as reproductive toxicity).

The EU pesticide assessment also includes hazard identification by considering all the species, e.g. on developmental toxicity (i.e. rabbit), mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (i.e. mouse) as well as endocrine disruption (including dog).

The qualitative differences can originate from the lack of an enzyme in a particular species producing a metabolite of interest. Quantitative differences can be observed due to various reasons, like lower expression or different kinetics of the enzyme, a different (iso)enzyme catalysing the metabolite production or different rate of further metabolism of the metabolite (Weidolf and Wilson, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0137" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Even if the metabolite profiles are qualitatively similar in different species, usually there are large differences in quantitative proportions of metabolites (e.g. Pelkonen et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Weidolf and Wilson, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0137" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Interindividual differences of various metabolites produced in animal species used in the toxicological studies are usually regarded as of smaller importance vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis interspecies differences.

</p><p>A prior knowledge of the likely routes of biotransformation of the analyte greatly facilitates the detection and structural characterisation of its metabolites. Together with accurate mass data with low mass error from the detected compounds and because common changes in molecular weights caused by metabolic reactions are well known, the combination of MS/MS and HRMS experiments can enable the differentiation in the biotransformation with different molecular formula but presenting the same nominal mass change. In addition to HRMS, the strength of time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;MS) instruments for metabolite screening is their very high detection sensitivity when a wide mass range of data is acquired. Thus, prediction values of expected metabolites allow for the construction of user&#8208;defined MS acquisition protocols that frequently reveal the presence of minor metabolites, even in the presence of a vast excess of coeluting endogenous constituents.</p><p>When the LC&#8211;MS methods do not give clear structural information for the formed metabolite, or the structure obtained by LC&#8211;MS methods must be elucidated in a more detailed manner, the synthesis of possible metabolites and consequent comparison of the LC&#8211;MS data for the detected metabolite and synthesised compounds are mandatory. The identification of a metabolite via the MS information only, including additional structural information that could be obtained via fragmentation analysis, high&#8208;resolution measurements and/or advanced MS acquisition mode such as ion mobility (IMS)&#8208;based approaches is generally considered as sufficient in the present context, but in some cases have to be then completed by NMR for a full structural elucidation.</p><p>For formal naming of novel metabolites identified for the first time, the PPR Panel recommends to be consistent with IUPAC nomenclature.

Metabolites found as residues in crops and/or livestock or groundwater metabolites may be the same as DHM and/or UHM: hence already known and tested to assess their relevance. If such information is not available, the first step should be based on alternative approaches to animal testing such as NAMS, including read&#8208;across, <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> tools and/or <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> methods. These alternative approaches are evolving very quickly, and therefore, this section describes different options to assess the available evidence.</p><p>For <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> testing of a metabolite, sufficient material is required, which may need to be synthesised. The PPR Panel acknowledges that testing of certain metabolites may be challenging, e.g. in case a metabolite is unstable. Therefore, the PPR Panel recommends a tailored testing strategy depending on the nature of the metabolite and by considering whether synthesis and testing of a metabolite is possible.</p><p>The PPR Panel recommends to assemble, weight and integrate all available evidence in a weight of evidence approach (EFSA Scientific Committee, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="efs26970-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) in order to reach conclusion on the biological relevance of human metabolites with regard to their toxicity (see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1009" ref-type="sec">I</xref>).</p><p>Although the different sources of information are reported separately, the PPR Panel recommends to follow an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0095" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>) by integrating all available data derived from multiple methods and sources, starting from <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and then to <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> data.

This approach can be useful in cases where human exposure is exhausting a small proportion of the HBGV. In such a case, the overall UF is calculated depending on the relative quantity of the DHM in humans compared to animal species.</p><p>The toxicity of a metabolite formed in up to fourfold quantities in humans compared to animal species is assumed to be covered by testing when applying an uncertainty factor of 100 to the reference point for the parent compound. Hence, it can generally be assumed that the quantity of <bold>metabolite</bold> produced in the animal species can be divided by an <bold>UF of 25</bold> (i.e. = 2.5 (interspecies differences in toxicodynamics (TD)) and human variability in TK (3.16) and TD (3.16), while the UF accounting for interspecies difference in TK (4) can be excluded (for explanation of the subfactors, see IPCS 2005) to arrive at the amount of metabolite in humans at the HBGV for the parent compound derived from the reference point divided by an UF of 100.</p><p>Two scenarios can be considered as examples for the approach (Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
<list list-type="order" id="efs26970-list-0008"><list-item><p>In the first scenario, the metabolite in humans is formed up to four times higher levels than in rats. For example, taking a quantity of metabolite in rat as 5% and a reference point of 100&#8201;mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, a quantity of 5&#8201;mg metabolite/kg bw per day has been tested. Applying an UF of 100 results in an HBGV of 1&#8201;mg/kg bw per day for the parent compound, whereas the safe dose for the metabolite is 0.2&#8201;mg/kg bw per day using the UF of 25. At the HBGV of 1&#8201;mg/kg bw per day for the parent compound, the amount of the metabolite formed in humans is tested as safe up to 0.2&#8201;mg/kg bw per day. This represents 20% of the HBGV of 1&#8201;mg/kg bw per day and it is fourfold higher than the 5% in rats. Hence, for a fourfold higher quantity in humans compared to the animal species, the toxicity of the metabolite has been sufficiently covered at the level of exposure at the HBGV when applying the UF of 100 for the parent compound.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the second scenario, the metabolite is formed in higher than fourfold quantities in humans compared to the animal species. For example, if the quantity of the disproportionate metabolite in rat is 5% and the quantity in humans is 40% (eightfold higher), the toxicity of the disproportionate metabolite is not sufficiently covered when using an UF of 100. In this case, assuming a reference point of 100&#8201;mg/kg bw per day for the parent compound, the HBGV would be 1&#8201;mg/kg bw per day for the parent, equivalent to a dose of 0.2&#8201;mg/kg bw per day for the disproportionate metabolite (see example 1). When exposing humans to the parent compound at a level of 1&#8201;mg/kg bw per day, i.e. equal to the HBGV, the metabolite level produced in humans would be 0.4&#8201;mg/kg per day. Since only exposure up to 0.2&#8201;mg/kg bw per day to the metabolite (5%) can be considered as safe, the exposure in humans would be a concern. This concern can be accounted for by applying an additional UF to the HBGV. This additional UF can be derived by calculating the ratio of quantities human/animal metabolite <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and divide this by 4 (see Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In this example, an additional UF of 2 ([40/5]/4) would be calculated resulting in an overall UF of 200. Accordingly, the HBGV for the parent compound would be 0.5&#8201;mg/kg bw per day. Lowering the HBGV as described would adequately protect humans to the toxicity of the parent compound and the disproportionate metabolite.</p></list-item></list>

In case a human metabolite is present only in one laboratory species, assessed only in very specific or limited studies (e.g. developmental toxicity study in rabbits or subchronic studies in dogs), further toxicological considerations are appropriate, since other endpoints might not be covered (e.g. carcinogenicity).</p><sec id="efs26970-sec-0025"><label>6.2.1</label><title>New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)/Non&#8208;animal or Alternative Testing Methods</title><p>One of the options to assess the potential toxicity of UHM and DHM would be animal testing, however, such studies are undesirable in view of the worldwide effort to reduce animal testing for ethical reasons. In addition, such studies are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, alternative methods to animal testing, also referred to as NAMs provide options to generate information on the potential toxicity of UHMs and DHMs. Although NAMs are widely used for data&#8208;poor chemicals, there is currently no EFSA harmonised guidance document on the use of NAMs in chemical risk assessment (see Section&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-0037" ref-type="sec">7.9</xref>).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">QSAR</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">and Read&#8208;across methods</italic>
</p><p>A first step to identify the potential hazard of the metabolite under investigation would be the use of non&#8208;testing methods such as QSAR and read&#8208;across. These methods allow to infer toxic properties (e.g. genotoxicity or general toxicity) of UHM or DHM based on data for structurally similar substances. The application of QSAR and read across for genotoxicity and general toxicity, and some worked examples, have been previously described in detail in the PPR Panel Guidance on the establishment of the residue definition for dietary risk assessment (EFSA PPR Panel, 2016). Below a brief description of both approaches is presented.</p><p>QSAR models are statistically based or knowledge&#8208;based models which link chemical structure to biological activity for a number of compounds and then predict such biological activity for data&#8208;poor chemicals within the same applicability domain. The increasing availability of data and modern machine learning techniques will further facilitate the development and increase the predictivity of QSARs (e.g. Pawar et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0106" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Muratov et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0077" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Keyvanpour and Shirzad, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Shah et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0118" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> part of assessment generally starts with the QSAR analysis, e.g. using the OECD Toolbox evaluation,<xref rid="efs26970-note-1006" ref-type="fn">6</xref> of the parent and related metabolites to reveal highest similarities (e.g. Dice index, analysis of functional groups).</p><p>While a simple similarity measure does not always reflect changes in reactivity and itself may not be enough to fully justify a read&#8208;across prediction (Schultz et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0116" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), further analyses at organic functional group levels are performed. In these analyses, potential significance of various functional groups in terms of TK and TD is considered.</p><p>QSARs are predominantly used for predicting genotoxic properties of substances with a known chemical structure. Currently, their use in predicting general toxicity is limited. For predicting genotoxicity, QSAR models are generally considered to give reliable results when the substance to be predicted is within the applicability domain (Benigni et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). When using QSARs, conclusions on the genotoxicity are generally drawn on the outcome of two or more independent QSAR models for each genotoxicity endpoint. All relevant genotoxicity endpoints, i.e. gene mutations, and structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations, have to be considered. The conclusion on the genotoxic potential of the metabolite(s) is justified by providing all necessary information, e.g. which models were used, the applicability domain and reliability of the models.</p><p>Read&#8208;across is a technique used for predicting endpoint information for one substance by using data on the same endpoint from one or more other substances which have been shown to be structurally related. In a read&#8208;across approach, experimental data on genotoxicity or other endpoints for one or more chemicals (source chemical(s)) can be used to make a prediction for the same endpoint for one or more different chemicals (target chemical(s)), e.g. UHM and DHM. The primary assumption is that the source and target chemical(s) provoke similar effects related to the assessed endpoints, usually based on structural similarity, and therefore exhibit similar biological activity (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0085" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>). Guidance on grouping and read&#8208;across or how these principles can be implemented have been published by ECHA (<xref rid="efs26970-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), OECD (<xref rid="efs26970-bib-0088" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and EFSA (<xref rid="efs26970-bib-0903" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>).</p><p>The read&#8208;across approach is a stepwise process, starting with defining the endpoint that is evaluated, and establishing a working hypothesis and justification for read&#8208;across. The structural similarities of the UHM or DHM and the source chemicals (for instance the parent or other chemicals) need to be assessed and the dissimilarities must be considered. The PPR Panel recommends to discuss the relevance of the similarities and dissimilarities identified for making use of read&#8208;across to evaluate the endpoint considered in the analysis. Based on the evaluation, it can be concluded whether the UHM or DHM is similar to the source chemicals and is expected to exert the same toxicity as the source chemicals or whether the UHM or DHM should be considered dissimilar and no conclusion on its toxic effect can be drawn.</p><p>For the QSAR as well as read&#8208;across approaches, it is essential that all steps in the process are well documented so that the adequacy and scientific validity of the approaches can be assessed.</p><p>The PPR Panel recommends to draw a final conclusion on the similarity between toxic potential of the UHM or DHM and the structurally related chemicals upon the outcome from the QSAR and read&#8208;across approaches and other available information, e.g. for <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> tests, using a weight of evidence approach (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2017a).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">In vitro methods.</italic> Genotoxicity testing of UHM or DHM (in case genotoxicity is not adequately covered by available data or QSAR predictions) should follow the outline of the EFSA genotoxicity testing strategies (EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; EFSA PPR Panel, 2016, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2017c</xref>). It is important to consider the structure of the metabolite, because this could affect the behaviour of the compound, e.g. with regard to the uptake into the cell. A possibility that a metabolite is further metabolised, needs consideration, also regarding the adequacy of the standard S9&#8208;mix. Relevant <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> genotoxicity tests have been included in the OECD guideline programme.</p><p>Alternative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test methods and strategies to measure TK processes (intestinal absorption and metabolism, hepatic transport and metabolism, etc.) (Olesti et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0100" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and TD processes at different levels of biological organisation (molecular, biochemical, cellular, etc.) are currently being developed, e.g. EUToxRisk (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.eu-toxrisk.eu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.eu&#8208;toxrisk.eu/</ext-link>), DNT IATA (EFSA PPR Panel, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), EPA list (US EPA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0132" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and OECD guidelines. As an excellent example, skin sensitisation can indicate the progress in development and application of non&#8208;animal test methods (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0095" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Concerning TK processes, only measurement of skin absorption using <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> methods is included in OECD guidelines (OECD TG 428; OECD, 2004) and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> CYP induction in human hepatocytes has been validated (Bernasconi et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Regarding TD processes, most OECD&#8208;approved guidelines are related to endocrine disruptor screening (e.g. OECD TG 455, 456, 458, 493; OECD, 2016, 2011, 2020c, 2015, respectively)). Many cell&#8208;based test panels for target organ toxicities have been developed and many of them are available commercially. Examples of such panels include microphysiological test systems (Marx et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0074" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), tissue chip technologies (Rusyn and Roth, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0112" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), imaging&#8208;based (cell painting) phenotypic profiling (Hussain et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Nyffeler et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell stress panels (Hatherell et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A recent example of the use of such <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> information for toxicological evaluation is coumarin (Baltazar et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Recently, the USA consumer product safety commission (CPSC) drafted a guidance to clarify to stakeholders the informational requirements of CPSC to evaluate NAMs and IATAs, e.g. related to concordance and reproducibility data, false&#8208;positive and false&#8208;negative rates, applicability domain, test endpoint and validation studies (CPSC, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The recently adopted 11th Revision of the SCCS Note for Guidance for assessing the safety of cosmetic ingredients (SCCS, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0114" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) is also a valuable document to be consulted, considering that animal testing in banned in Europe for these kinds of products and alternative approaches are described. This or similar guidance from regulatory agencies will facilitate the use of data obtained by NAMs and IATAs to provide information on the toxicity of UHMs and DHMs.</p><p>Non&#8208;guideline <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test methods are increasingly being used for providing information as part of the weight of scientific evidence in characterising mechanism or mode of action or a hazard in order to better understand the toxicity observed with parent and metabolite(s) and used in risk&#8208;based decision&#8208;making. Furthermore, the results of these <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> methods are important as building blocks for molecular initiating and key events and their relationships in developing adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) which would be useful in the frame of IATA schemes, provided they are scientifically justifiable and suitable for risk assessment purposes. However, the PPR Panel recommends to consider the use <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> methods, as well as experimental evidence obtained with the approaches mentioned above, on a case&#8208;by&#8208;case basis and by assessing the relevance and reliability of the alternative approaches (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0094" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>). When assessing the internal validity of the study, the criteria set by National Toxicology Programme&#8208;Office of Heath Assessment and Translation (NTP&#8208;OHAT) is recommended to be applied (NTP, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0026"><label>6.2.2</label><title>

This is unless an alternative study would better reflect the most reasonable comparison by using lower number of animals.

<bold>Consider contribution of comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies for the assessment of the human relevance of toxic effects observed in animals</bold>. The species&#8208;specific formation of metabolites can also be useful as additional line of evidence for assessing the human relevance of toxicity effects observed in animal species. The use of hepatocytes from all animal species used in toxicological studies (i.e. rat, mouse, dog and rabbit) would be strongly recommended to address human relevance of adverse effects observed in animal species, within a weight of evidence approach (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2017a). It is clear that a species&#8208;specific effect e.g. in rats can be only tentatively attributed to the concurrent formation of a &#8216;unique&#8217; metabolite and further mechanistic studies on the plausibility of the hypothesis are needed. However, this can flag a potential issue about the relevance of deriving the reference values from toxicological studies from that species. Information from comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism can be added to dose&#8208;temporal concordance table within the ICPS frameworks for assessment of mode of actions and human relevance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>

The species&#8208;specific formation of metabolites may be also important in the discussion on which animal species the setting of reference values should be based. In case rat and human have a similar metabolic profile, while the dog is characterised by a peculiar metabolic pattern with the lowest NOAEL observed in the 1&#8208;year dog study, then it should be proven that the metabolites formed only in dogs are those responsible for the observed effects and the dog is therefore not the relevant species for human risk assessment. This recommendation is in line with the EU Regulation 283/2013.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Consider comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies as a tool to improve the design of toxicological data set and reduce animal testing (3Rs)</bold>. For new pesticide active substances safety assessment, specific studies should be performed on defined species and this is currently not subject to changes. However, even if it is not the primary goal of this Scientific Opinion, it is worth mentioning that in other areas (e.g. drug development) comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies provide useful information to select the most relevant species in toxicological studies for new developed test item. In this case, the kinetic information is collected before the other toxicity studies are conducted and the most appropriate species is selected, with a substantial reduction in the number of animals tested (EMA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; FDA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A first attempt to follow this line is given in Commission Regulation (EU) No 283/2013, where it is stated: <italic toggle="yes">5.5 Long term toxicity and carcinogenicity &#8211; If comparative metabolism data indicate that either rat or mouse is an inappropriate model for human cancer risk assessment, an alternative species shall be considered</italic>. This consideration could be subject to discussion when it comes to the update of the data requirements for pesticides in the future, as this is in line with the animal welfare policy in the EU. EU legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes identifies guiding principles for the ethical use of animals in experimental procedures (Directive 2010/63/EU), based on the 3Rs principles (replace, reduce and refine). As part of the DG&#8208;Sante, EURL ECVAM has a specific mandate specified in EU legislation and includes a number of duties to advance the 3Rs principles of animal testing. In this context and based on the internationally established principles of the 3Rs, EFSA is committed to promote use of data derived from alternative approaches or NAMs, where possible (EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).

<bold>Address non&#8208;hepatic metabolism when information from the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> rat TK study can indicate that non&#8208;hepatic metabolism plays a major role</bold>. When <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> rat metabolites formed are predominantly products of esterases (e.g. carboxylesterases (CEs)) or other biotransformation enzymes (e.g. monoamino oxidases (MAO)), and when the conversion rate is high (i.e. practically all the parent is expected to be initially hydrolysed on the basis of the rat <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK data), one should consider using both a liver&#8208;based tool and a suitable extrahepatic tool relevant for the exposure route (i.e. an enterocyte test system for oral exposure). If hydrolysis is very rapid in the enterocyte test system, systemic exposure is expected to be mainly to the principal product(s) of hydrolysis. An enterocyte testing system (or analogous) is needed to evaluate the extent of first&#8208;pass metabolism and the extent of exposure of the liver to the predominant hydrolysis product. Consequently, the PPR Panel recommends to use the principal hydrolysed metabolite as a substrate for the liver&#8208;based test system to evaluate its further phase I and II metabolic fates. Interspecies differences in liver metabolism of pesticides play a critical role to depict their comparative metabolism, kinetics and associated consequences on toxicity (detoxification/bioactivation). In addition, intestinal metabolism plays an important role in the first pass metabolism and depicting interspecies differences related to such processes can support the development of quantitative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>&#8211;<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> extrapolation and PBK models.

As described in this Scientific Opinion, the data generated from comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies are used to assess interspecies differences in metabolite formation in a qualitative and quantitative manner. A direct translation of such <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> data to the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> situation is not straightforward, and more insight and better understanding is needed here. For an optimal translation of animal toxicity data to the human situation regarding interspecies differences in kinetics, quantitative insight into interspecies differences in time&#8208;dependent internal concentrations would be needed, as an ultimate aim, for both the parent chemical and its metabolites at defined exposure scenarios. Such time&#8208;dependent internal exposures do not solely depend on biotransformation in the liver, but also on other kinetic processes, which can differ extensively between species, including uptake and metabolism from the gastrointestinal tract, plasma protein binding, plasma: tissue partitioning, excretion rate and for certain chemicals extrahepatic metabolism and transporter protein&#8208;mediated kinetics. These chemical&#8208; and species&#8208;specific kinetic processes can be integrated in PBK models, which can be used to predict/simulate internal concentrations at defined exposure scenarios.

Such CSAFs have been applied in the context of EFSA&#8217;s risk assessment for cadmium through a meta&#8208;analysis of TD biomarkers combined with PBK modelling (EFSA CONTAM, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A further example is the phosphates as food additives (E 338&#8208; 341, E343, E450 &#8211; 452) where mechanistic information and a probabilistic approach was used for deriving a CSAF reducing it from the default of 100 to 4 (Smeraldi et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0120" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition, human variability in TK processes using the pharmaceutical database has been investigated for specific isoforms of phase I (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6; PON1) and phase II enzymes (e.g. GSTs) by means of meta&#8208;analysis of parameters reflecting acute (Cmax) and chronic exposure (AUC) (Testai et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0125" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The resulting variability distributions were combined with isoform&#8208;specific <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism data for food relevant chemicals (e.g. pesticide active substances, contaminants) to predict their blood concentrations in humans by means of PBK and QIVIVE modelling. Finally, PBK&#8208;TD modelling has also been developed for specific pesticide active substances and endpoints such as acetyl&#8208;cholinesterase inhibition (Kasteel et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Testai et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0125" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Such developments will allow the integration of quantitative mode of action and AOP information in chemical risk assessment. Since the AOP framework does not include the TK dimension, the Aggregated Exposure Pathway (AEP) concept has been proposed to integrate such dimension and EFSA&#8217;s Scientific Committee has recommended to further develop knowledge on MoA, AOP and AEPs (EFSA Scientific Committee, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).

Phase I (i.e. oxidations, reduction, hydrolysis, etc.) is responsible for either detoxification or for bioactivation resulting in the formation of more toxic metabolites. Phase II metabolism (conjugations a parent or a phase I metabolite with glucuronic acid, sulfate, glutathione, etc.) mainly facilitates the excretion of chemicals by making them more hydrophilic and generally makes reactive metabolites inactive by, e.g. glutathione conjugation. However, it is known that some phase II metabolites can be toxic (Glatt, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), indicating that it is relevant to also cover all Phase II metabolites, including sulfo&#8208;conjugation for which the responsible enzymes are lacking in liver microsomes, as well as glutathione conjugation which takes predominantly place in the soluble fraction in the cell.</p><p>The number of metabolites produced from a single substance may be from none or a few to more than hundreds. Often, one or a couple major and several minor metabolites are formed from a single compound. However, the PPR Panel noted that primary metabolites are usually further metabolised to more distal metabolites and thus amounts of any single metabolite could change as a function of time, either decreasing, if further metabolism is very active, or increasing as happens to many more distal metabolites, e.g. glucuronides and other conjugates. It should also be remembered that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> metabolites move through the body to be ultimately excreted via urine or bile (faeces). Thus, actually the measurement of metabolites in any <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system is a moving target, a snapshot of the continuous dynamic process, and by <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> systems, it is possible to obtain only a partial, incomplete and time point specific view of the metabolite profile of a substance.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0040"><title>A.2 <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> test systems</title><p>A large variety of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test systems to study metabolism are currently available ranging from tests to study single or a few metabolising enzymes (e.g. recombinant enzymes) to organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip techniques intended to mimic metabolically active tissues/organs in more physiological arrangements (e.g. organoids). These <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> hepatic test systems are used for the production, identification and quantitation of metabolites, but they all have definitive advantages and disadvantages in this respect. Subcellular fractions (e.g. liver microsomes) and isolated hepatocytes have been used for decades for metabolism studies and there is a huge database on using them for specific purposes in metabolism studies. There are a large number of more elaborated test systems (see Table&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">A.1</xref>), many of them commercially available, but these systems are still under development and there is insufficient experience and validation.</p><p>Because the goal of this opinion is to compare metabolite profiles between humans and test species with the aim to detect both UHM and DHM, to be applied for human risk assessment based on animal regulatory toxicity studies, the outcome of the test should mimic the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> situation as much as possible. In the context of this opinion, it is appropriate to state that there exists a common consensus among scientists and regulators that hepatocyte <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system is the best option when there is a need to produce a metabolite profile resembling an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> profile. The main reasons to select hepatocytes have been elaborated in Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0006" ref-type="sec">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0041"><title>A.3 Short&#8208;term incubation: hepatocytes in suspension</title><p>As explained in Section <xref rid="efs26970-sec-0006" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, the opinion recommends using in the first place a pool of hepatocytes in suspension, unless there are reasons as elaborated below to employ cultured hepatocytes, and to perform incubations at three time points within a 4&#8208;h time frame. If conversion of the parent is less than 20% (and if this is not increased to 20% or more upon increasing the hepatocyte concentration (e.g. to 2 million hepatocytes/mL)), or existing information suggests a low clearance for that chemical, the PPR Panel recommends to perform a longer incubation by using plated hepatocytes exposed to the chemical for 24&#8201;h.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0042"><title>A.4 Long&#8208;term incubation: hepatocytes plated</title><p>For chemicals that are slowly metabolised, the PPR Panel recommends to use plated primary hepatocytes, since suspended hepatocytes have a limited viability at longer incubation times (more than 4&#8201;h). In the context of this opinion, a chemical (parent compound) is considered slowly metabolised when its concentration decreases less than 20% after 4&#8201;h incubation using the recommended cell concentration of 1 million hepatocytes/mL. Only when the slowly metabolised test item is known to have a half&#8208;life lower than 24&#8201;h, the long&#8208;term incubation can be skipped. Various long&#8208;term hepatic test systems are available, as being described in Bernasconi et al. (<xref rid="efs26970-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It is considered sufficient to use plated hepatocytes in a 2D configuration. It is acknowledged that various culture techniques using 3D configurations are rapidly evolving and currently available from commercial developers (see Table&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">A.1</xref>). Advantages of 3D configurations include a better differentiation state and longer longevity. On the other hand, one should consider that chemical diffusion into the liver cells, and related availability of chemical to the metabolising enzymes, may be lower in 3D configurations. The use of 3D configurations is in this stage not recommended because the aim of this opinion is to have simple study designs, and since various adequate 2D models are available. Furthermore, the chemical applicability domain of hepatic 3D models has not been evaluated so far, so their appropriateness for comparative metabolism studies with pesticide active substances is not known.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="efs26970-tbl-0001" content-type="Table" orientation="portrait"><label>Table A.1</label><caption><p>

Particularly, the radiolabel should be positioned in the molecule so that all significant moieties or degradation products can be tracked. If multiple ring structures or significant side chains are present, separate studies reflecting labelling of each ring or side chain will normally be required if it is anticipated that cleavage between these moieties may occur. In general, the position of the radiolabel when conducting a comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study should reflect what is done when performing <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> ADME studies according to OECD TG 417 (item 18 and 19 in the OECD TG 417; OECD, 2010).</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0045"><title>B.3 Assess solubility, stability, volatility</title><p>The assessment of solubility, volatility and stability is highly relevant to determine the highest concentration of the test item that can be present in the medium containing the test system and to properly characterise the test item.</p><p>In line with OECD GD on GIVIMP (2018a), the PPR recommends to determine solubility, stability, volatility and non&#8208;specific binding (see Appendix&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-sec-1003" ref-type="sec">C.1.3</xref> for more detailed discussion on non&#8208;specific binding). These parameters can affect the concentration and the bioavailability of the test item and reference compound added to hepatocytes when performing a comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study.</p><p>The concentration of the test item added to the test system (by diluting a stock solution in solvent to the medium) is called nominal concentration. Once the stock solution of the test item is added to the cell medium containing the test system (hepatocytes), the concentration of the test item available to the hepatocytes may be lower than the nominal concentration. This concentration available for the cells is called actual concentration. An actual concentration lower than the nominal concentration can be due to one or more processes related to solubility, stability, volatility and non&#8208;specific binding, which depend on the specific chemical&#8211;physical properties of the test item. Low actual concentration of the test item might cause that some relevant metabolites are formed at low levels which can eventually be not detected because below the limit of detection of the analytical method. Therefore, considering that the experimental layout is designed to maximise the chances of detecting all relevant metabolites by reducing any source which can lead to a low actual concentration of the test item.</p><p>Poor solubility and/or high volatility of the test item contributes to a low actual concentration. Moreover, testing a test item with poor solubility or that is highly volatile can be technically difficult.</p><p>Most probably, solubility of the test item has been assessed earlier in the testing process (<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> TK study and toxicology studies), before performing the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study. However, the PPR recommends to always evaluate solubility before conducting a comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study, as also indicated in GIVIMP. This is necessary because the solvent used to prepare the stock solution and then the cell medium for the working solution are most likely different from those used in the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies and solubility may be different.</p><p>It is suggested to prepare, if solubility allows, stock solutions that are 1,000 times higher than the desired nominal concentrations. OECD GIVIMP provides technical guidance on how to measure solubility, both in stock solutions and in working solutions. The easiest method relies on visual inspection although the accuracy is less than when using appropriate instrumentation as nephelometry analysis. This method is outlined in a recent validation study with human hepatocytes by EURL&#8208;ECVAM (Bernasconi et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>Solubility has to be always measured in both the stock and working solutions. In case of apparent insolubility in the chosen solvent or in cell medium, dissolution can be attempted by trying other potential solvents or by incremental twofold dilution as necessary.</p><p>Stability refers to the degradation of the test item either under storage conditions and/or in test conditions which is not due to metabolism (e.g. chemical hydrolysis in aqueous solutions). The stability of the stock solution can be assessed to cover the storage duration period (days, weeks, months depending on the conditions of storage). Stability should also be assessed in the cell medium of the working solution at 37&#176;C in medium by measuring the test item pre&#8208; and post&#8208;incubation (i.e. 4&#8201;h for short&#8208;term incubation and 24&#8201;h for long&#8208;term incubation) including centrifugation for observation of any precipitation (pellet residue).</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0046"><title>B.4 Preparation of stock and working solutions</title><p>The PPR recommends to follow the principles described in GIVIMP (OECD, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0094" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>) to prepare stock and working solutions</p><p>When preparing the stock solution, different solvents can be used, depending on physical&#8211;chemical properties of the test item, to solubilise the test item.

It must be noted, however, that certain chemicals adhere to glass surfaces, indicating that for such chemicals storage in glass may not be recommends.</p><p>The working solution is obtained by diluting in one or more steps the stock solution. The working solution must be prepared in the same cell medium used when conducting the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism study with hepatocytes. Attention should be paid to the amount of organic solvent which is present in the working solution. The dilution scheme from the stock to the working solution can be designed to ensure that a minimum of organic solvent is present in the working solution (i.e. &lt; 0.5% DMSO).

This last requirement is rather apparent with human hepatocytes because of their variable contents of biotransformation enzymes. For this reason, pools based on several, preferably at least 20 different donors are regularly used to level off considerable interindividual variability (Tracy et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0129" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Pooled human hepatocytes consisting of 10&#8211;100 individuals could be purchased from several companies.</p><p>As hepatocytes from maximally five species (human, rat, mouse, dog, rabbit) will be compared, a question about suitable positive controls becomes important.

Alongside with historical values, they provide information on the viability and metabolic competence of the hepatocyte pool used.

Potential cytotoxicity of the test item for hepatocytes is determined starting from the highest soluble concentration, followed by a pre&#8208;experimented dilution scheme. The incubation time should follow the conditions used for the metabolism studies (i.e. 4&#8201;h for short&#8208;term incubation and 24&#8201;h for long&#8208;term incubation).</p><p>The PPR recommends to test for cytotoxicity a highest concentration of 100&#8201;&#181;mol/L in cell medium, provided that this concentration is soluble.

A cytotoxicity study will be carried out using 100&#8201;&#181;mol/L (or the highest soluble concentration) as the highest concentration, including also lower concentrations using a fixed dilution factor of 2 (final concentrations amounting to 100&#8201;&#181;mol/L, 50&#8201;&#181;mol/L, 25&#8201;&#181;mol/L, 12.5&#8201;&#181;mol/L, 6.25&#8201;&#181;mol/L, 3.125&#8201;&#181;mol/L, etc.). Based on the results of the cytotoxicity study, the highest concentration to be used for the comparative metabolism study will be selected, being the highest non&#8208;cytotoxic concentration (causing no more than 20% cell death).

This would allow to show that the test system adequately works when assessing the metabolism of the test item. With commercially available hepatocytes, suppliers typically provide for the batches they sell information on rates of metabolite formation related to various substrates, providing insights into the metabolic capacity of the batch used.

Results in the literature indicated that chemicals can be adsorbed to plastics depending on the lipophilicity in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner, possibly leading to binding saturation at high concentrations of the chemical. It has also been shown that serum constituents and plastics compete for binding the chemical (Pomponio et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0109" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

Furthermore, the PPR recommends to assess non&#8208;specific binding for the different species if different cell media and labware is used for different species. Overall, the recovery should be similar across all species used in the main experiment. The reason, similarly to the cytotoxicity assessment, is to minimise any source of variability (in this case due to difference in chemical bioavailability) which could confound the comparison of metabolic profile among species, especially to identify and evaluate DHM. This means that in case a recovery around 80% is obtained, this could be acceptable providing the value is similar across all species.

For rabbit, it is preferable to use only female hepatocytes (since only rabbit female is used in the developmental study).</p><p>Regarding the number of donors to be present in the hepatocyte pools, it is recommended to use a number of donors as high as possible. Regarding human hepatocytes (in suspension) pools of up to hundreds of donors are commercially available. As a minimum, 20 donors are recommended, to cover intraspecies differences in metabolism. For laboratory animals, less intraspecies differences are expected, and a pool of at least three donors is recommended to be used.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0061"><title>C.3.6 Technical replicates</title><p>The PPR recommends to run for each condition (time point and concentration), three technical replicates by using the same batch of pooled hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0062"><title>C.3.7 Long&#8208;term exposure: 24&#8201;h</title><p>Although isolated primary hepatocytes in solution perform well up to 4&#8208;h incubation time in terms of xenobiotic metabolism capacity, longer incubations lead to a rapid deterioration of enzyme activities. To preserve the hepatocellular phenotype of the isolated cells over this limit, cryopreservation is currently a routine way to get the desired cells in required amounts for either immediate short&#8208;term experiments (&#8216;in solution&#8217;) or metabolism&#8208;competent hepatocyte cultures for extended incubations (&#8216;plated&#8217;). Plated hepatocytes are especially useful for the study of compounds with low metabolism (e.g. Ma et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For long&#8208;term culturing, various strategies have been used to maintain the differentiation status of the isolated hepatocytes, but the main focus is still on the strategy that employs differentiation&#8208;promoting compounds in the culture medium. An overview on various antidifferentiation procedures and cryopreservation agents has been published (Gouliarmou et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Metabolically competent cryopreserved human primary hepatocyte culture used for the validation of CYP induction has been recently published (Bernasconi et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and protocols are available (TSAR, TM2009&#8208;13), where also most important primary literature sources have been referenced.

A scientifically based rationale may be submitted in lieu of conducting studies with multiple radiolabels if no cleavage is anticipated.

Radiolabels, which ideally do not affect the physicochemical properties of the compound should allow both the qualitative and quantitative determination of the parent compound and its metabolites. When different concentrations of test substance are used, the total radioactivity percentage converted to metabolites at these concentrations should be consistent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incubations conditions (e.g. million cells/mL and protein concentration) should be carefully adjusted to prevent excessive non&#8208;specific binding in the assay. In addition to protein removal, the addition of organic solvent to the sample disrupts any binding between parent compound and/or metabolites and the proteins present in solution, and thus, the analyte concentrations obtained represent total concentration, which is equivalent to the sum of bound and unbound (free) analyte concentrations. If there is a considerable fraction of non&#8208;extractable radioactivity, it could be due to binding of reactive intermediates to macromolecules and may need further investigations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ability of the procedure to recover radioactivity added should be demonstrated. Recovery is typically inclusive of test material recovered in the extraction solvent, pellet residue and appropriate vial washes. Overall recovery should ideally be quantitative for applied radioactivity (i.e. &gt; 90%). If not, further investigation may be required to ascertain the cause of the loss.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When a PBK model is considered to be used and taken into account that the analytes under study depends, e.g. of an active transport process, concentrations of the parent compounds and/or the metabolites in the intracellular space may be higher or lower than the extracellular space. In this case, and to be efficiently used, the intracellular concentration of compound must be carefully estimated to be incorporated in the model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The questions about the use of HRMS methods to circumvent the need for radioactive material in identifying metabolites in complex mixtures are controversial.

</p></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-0065"><title>D.2 Identification and Characterisation</title><p>Identification refers to the exact structural determination of components of the total radioactive residue. Typically, identification is accomplished either by co&#8208;chromatography of the metabolite with known standards using two different systems or by techniques capable of positive structural identification such as MS, NMR, etc. In the case of co&#8208;chromatography, chromatographic techniques utilising the same stationary phase with two different solvent systems (e.g. various pH) could be considered to be an adequate two&#8208;method verification of metabolite identity, if the methods separation could be demonstrated as orthogonal. Identification by co&#8208;chromatography should be obtained using two dissimilar, analytically independent systems such as reversed&#8208;phase, HILIC or ion&#8208;exchange HPLC, as example.
<list list-type="bullet" id="efs26970-list-0044"><list-item><p>For routine metabolite identification (Met&#8208;ID), the complete LC&#8211;MS workflow can be greatly supported by dedicated Met&#8208;ID application managers implemented in the MS data acquisition and data processing software of the LC&#8211;MS instrument. Data processing is based on the comparison between data files acquired for biological samples and for blank/control samples, thus searching for differences in the two data sets that can be correlated to the parent compound or its metabolites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is generally believed that a single chemical shift, <italic toggle="yes">m/z</italic> value or other singular chemical parameter is insufficient for metabolite identification. The latter traditionally involves extraction, isolation and purification followed by elemental analysis, accurate mass measurement, ion mass fragmentation patterns, NMR (1H, 13C, 2D) and other spectral data such as IR, UV or chemical derivatisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The accurate mass data together with high spectral accuracy (isotopic pattern determination) provide key information for molecular formula assignment. Characteristic <italic toggle="yes">m/z</italic> shifts that occur in Phase I and Phase II metabolisms could be anticipated. From an MS point of view, the biotransformation of the analyte results in metabolic m/z shifts relative to the m/z of the parent compound, e.g., a shift of &#8722;14.052&#8201;Da due to demethylation and +15.995&#8201;Da due to hydroxylation, N&#8208;oxide or sulfoxide formation. Therefore, from the <italic toggle="yes">m/z</italic> shifts in a metabolite, one can often investigate more carefully which biotransformation reaction has occurred.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Metabolites often share the same elemental composition and molecular mass, therefore without the use of standards, the discrimination of isomeric compounds remains challenging.

The majority of chiral test substances exhibit slight differences in metabolism; however, some notable examples are available where major differences in metabolism of enantiomers occur (UK DEFRA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0131" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In these cases, the analytical workflow described in the EFSA guidance (EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0903" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>) can be followed in the comparative <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> metabolism studies (Nallani et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0903" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>).</p><p>When an accurate identification of isomers is necessary, the development of direct or indirect chiral chromatographic methods that unambiguously separate different stereoisomers is required (Zhao et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0148" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Here, NMR spectroscopy can be very powerful in determining structural configurations of stereoisomers. If there are differences in metabolism of stereoisomers, the toxicological significance of these differences can be further considered as defined by the EFSA guidance (EFSA, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0903" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>; see also de Albuquerque et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="efs26970-sec-1005"><title>Appendix E &#8211; Reactive metabolites</title><p>Reactive unstable metabolites and metabolism&#8208;connected free radicals are significant initiators of tissue injuries and toxicities, e.g. genotoxicity (Stachulski et al., <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0124" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

</p><p>In the situation in which the animal data are represented by the grey circles, the metabolite would not be considered a DHM (all time points factor difference &lt; 4). It must be noted that for the situation in which the animal data are represented by the grey triangles, inclusion of more than two time points has clear added value, as the temporal trend is not linear as for the other situations, and if only one time point would have been included, the metabolite may not have been identified as DHM. In reality, this can be a metabolite that is further metabolised in the test species (e.g. a second oxidation or a conjugation) which may be absent in humans. In that situation, the metabolite has been tested in the related animal study but (relative) exposure may be much lower in the test species than in humans, and therefore, the metabolite is considered as being disproportionate.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="efs26970-fig-0009" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure H.1</label><caption><p>Hypothetical examples on time&#8208;dependent formation of a given metabolite with incubations using hepatocytes of humans (open black circles) and a test species (grey symbols, three different scenarios).

As indicated in the opinion, a high concentration needs to be included (100&#8201;&#181;mol/L when possible, regarding cell viability and solubility), providing the highest chance on detecting potential UHM. However, it must be noted that at these high concentrations, metabolic reactions may get saturated for one species, but possibly not for the other, indicating that for the identification of a possible DHM, inclusion of lower concentrations in which saturation is less likely, is important. In Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">H.2</xref>, hypothetical data from a theoretical experiment are presented on the time&#8208;dependent formation of a metabolite obtained with human hepatocytes (open black circles) and hepatocytes from a test species (grey circles). In this example, reaction for the formation of the metabolite gets saturated for humans but not for the test species. Therefore, when only including a high concentration (Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">H.2</xref>C), this metabolite would not be identified as a potential DHM, whereas it would be identified as such when also including the lowest concentration (Figure&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">H.2</xref>A). In general, including three concentrations (e.g. one low, one intermediate and one high concentration) provides better data to identify a possible DHM, giving insights into possible species&#8208;dependent differences in saturation of biotransformation reactions.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="Figure" id="efs26970-fig-0010" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure H.2</label><caption><p>Hypothetical example on the time&#8208;dependent formation of a given metabolite with incubations using hepatocytes of humans (open black circles) and a test species (grey circles) at a low (A), intermediate (B) and high (C) concentration of the test item.

The scientific rationale behind is to evaluate whether all significant metabolites formed in the human <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> test system, as a surrogate of the in vivo situation, are also present at comparable levels in the animal species tested in toxicological studies and, therefore, if their potential toxicity has been appropriately covered by animal studies. In order to address such questions, the assessor needs to evaluate whether unique or disproportionate human metabolite(s) (UHM and DHM) are formed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (hepatocytes) and such differences in the profile of metabolites across species can be either qualitative or quantitative. Hence, the generic WoE aims to answer related questions which can be formulated as follows:</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Is</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">a UM or DHM produced in humans compared to the test species?</italic>
</p><p>

In this context, depending on the evidence available, this will allow to reach a conclusion on the&#8201;biological relevance of the human metabolites with regard to&#8201;their&#8201;toxicity (EFSA Scientific Committee, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>):</p><p>

The methods of choice to be applied will depend on data availability, context of the assessment, complexity of the method, time constraints and resources and the assessor should provide a rationale for choosing a particular method. A key aspect for weighing and integrating the evidence is the assessment of the reliability, relevance and consistency of the evidence and the iterative nature of the process (EFSA Scientific Committee, <xref rid="efs26970-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>).</p><p>Conclusion and summary of results</p><p>Table&#8201;<xref rid="efs26970-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">I.1</xref> summarises the WoE assessment with regard to comparative metabolism of pesticide active substances in humans and test species and its toxicological consequences.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="efs26970-tbl-0002" content-type="Table" orientation="portrait"><label>Table I.1</label><caption><p>Weight of Evidence reporting table</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top" rowspan="1">Question (s)</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
