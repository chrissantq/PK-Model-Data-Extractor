Recognition of this need by the pharmaceutical industry has provided a motivation for research into the development of reliable complex models for use in drug delivery, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. Both 3D in vitro and ex vivo models can enhance drug-testing and discovery prospects over the more traditionally used 2D, monolayer culture systems and animal models. Despite the widespread acceptance that 3D tissue modelling is advantageous in this field, there remains a lack of standardisation in the models throughout literature.

These models offer more physiologically relevant environments for testing new drugs and drug delivery systems (DDS). Whilst traditional high-throughput methods of drug screening using tissue culture plastic matrices have been widely accepted for decades, several pharma companies have now shown acknowledgement of the need for more physiologically relevant platforms to boost drug discovery prospectives. A major advantage of developing these in vitro tissue models is the potential to minimise reliance on in vivo animal studies and help research adhere to the 3&#8201;R&#8217;s of animal testing. Thus, dramatically reducing the ethical concerns and costs associated with drug development. Additionally, in some cases in vitro models are considered superior to in vivo models due to the use of human cells, increasing the transferability compared to tests conducted in different species. Whilst these models have many advantages, researchers have described a range of limitations of in vitro and ex vivo models which should be addressed. These include problems with long term maintenance of viability during extended periods of culture and complex fabrication methods which lack standardisation.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The development, optimisation and characterisation of oral mucosal models has been subject to increasing interest over the past decade. Several applications for such models have been described, namely biological characterisation of biomaterial interaction with the oral mucosa, modelling of oral infection/disease states and evaluation of DDSs.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr5-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Many studies have reported the development of such models utilising a range of scaffolds, cell sources, seeding techniques and culture conditions. Within this review we will focus on the development of in vitro oral mucosal models for testing of DDSs. The designed model should mimic as closely as possible the native environment in which the DDS will be utilised; therefore the complex in vitro model should be tailored to the specific final application. This may introduce complexities within models for testing of DDSs designed to treat infections or trauma injuries of the oral mucosa itself as these disease states should be considered during the model development. Whereas, for a DDS designed for systemic delivery via the oral mucosal route an in vitro model of normal oral mucosal state may be appropriate.</p><p>Several advantages pertaining to the transmucosal oral delivery of drugs has led to increased interest in these kinds of DDSs. Bypass of the hepatic first-pass metabolism is frequently highlighted as a key advantage for the use of transmucosal drug delivery.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> Often, the bioavailability of drugs is greatly reduced due to metabolic action in the liver, this extreme reduction in the amount of active drug emerging from the liver to the circulatory system may be avoided via transmucosal delivery.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> Additional advantages include, easy and self-administered treatment, a range of dosage forms and rapid onset of action with the possibility to incorporate sustained release mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Despite the multiple advantages described here these DDSs do not come without obstacles. A universal obstacle with the development of these DDSs is related to the limitation of maximum dosage which can be administrated with a single treatment.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr10-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> Many of the other concerns are specific to certain patient groups. The oral transmucosal route is not suitable for patients suffering from frequent vomiting or those suffering dry mouth, as they may experience poor drug dissolution, leading to reduced adsorption through the mucosa.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> Conversely excessive saliva production, which can be common with neurological diseases, could cause a wash-out effect which also impairs mucosal adsorption.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> In young and elderly patients these DDSs may also pose choking risks.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> This concern may also come into play during periods of unconsciousness for patients admitted in hospital or other care settings.</p></sec><sec id="section2-20417314241313458"><title>Drug delivery via the oral mucosa</title><p>Among the various drug delivery routes, the oral pathway has attracted the most attention due to its unique advantages, including sustained and controllable delivery, ease of administration, feasibility for solid formulations, patient compliance and an intensified immune response in the case of vaccines.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr16-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The oral mucosa serves as a versatile interface for drug delivery, offering several unique features that aid in the efficient and effective absorption of medications.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> One key advantage lies in its expansive surface area covering 170&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>, encompassing diverse regions such as the buccal, sublingual, and gingival mucosa. This extensive coverage presents abundant opportunities for drug absorption, enabling swift and effective uptake of medications administered via the oral mucosa.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> This large surface area contributes to enhanced drug bioavailability, fostering optimal therapeutic outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, drug molecules trapped within mucus are protected against the shear stresses caused by flowing gastric juices.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr21-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup> Orally administered drugs can be absorbed in four types of pathways: transcellular (intracellular), paracellular (intercellular), carrier-mediated transcellular and facilitated transport (<xref rid="fig1-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1-20417314241313458" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pathways for therapeutic drug absorption via the oral route.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10.1177_20417314241313458-fig1.jpg"/></fig><p>Among these pathways, the passive, transcellular and paracellular, pathways are the main mechanism. The choice of absorption route is dependent on the hydrophilic, hydrophobic or amphiphilic characteristics. Larger hydrophobic drug molecules typically prefer transcellular routes, while smaller hydrophilic molecules favour paracellular routes.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> The hydrophobic pathway utilises the paracellular lipid domains, while the hydrophilic pathway takes advantage of the fluid channels connected to the polar head regions of proteins and lipids. Most medications can diffuse via both pathways at the same time, however the route with lowest levels of resistance to penetration is typically preferred.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> These combined features of the oral mucosa render it an extremely versatile anatomical site for the delivery of a wide range of therapeutics. However, in comparison with other routes, the absorption mechanism for drugs via the oral mucosal pathway is more complex and faces several barriers. The barriers to oral mucosal drug absorption can be divided into two types: (i) metabolic and (ii) physical. With both barriers the extent to which they contribute to inhibition of drug movement are drug dependent. Additionally, the physical barrier to drug absorption is a function of the physicochemical properties of the mucosal membrane, specifically concerning the individual layers which constitute the oral mucosae.</p></sec><sec id="section3-20417314241313458"><title>Features contributing to the effectiveness of drug delivery via the oral mucosa</title><p>The mucus layer covering the epithelium is the first structure encountered by a drug or DDS prior to absorption.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Mucus plays a dual role in the absorption and desorption of medications administered orally. Two distinct overlaying layers typically make up the mucosal layer: an inner, firmly adhering layer and an outer, loosely adherent layer. The narrower inner mucus, a make-up of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and cell-bound mucin, is known to aid in drug absorption and improve uptake efficiency.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> The thicker mucus on the outside is a barrier that prevents medications and other molecules from moving freely. It acts as a selective filter to molecules and particles, keeping them from penetrating mucosal tissues&#8217; epithelial surface.

</sup> Mucus acts as a powerful barrier that may be the primary obstacle to drug absorption by establishing an adhesive, unstimulated, viscoelastic layer next to the epithelial surface. It is designed to effectively trap and quickly remove microorganisms and foreign particles from unprotected epithelial surfaces. Mucus is constantly secreted to keep pathogens out of the body and to lubricate the epithelium&#8217;s surface as foreign objects pass through. This shortens the residence time of particles that are unable to pass through the GI mucus&#8217;s weakly adherent layer.<sup>

</sup> The presence of glycoproteins and lipids in mucus forms a protective barrier over epithelial cells, enhancing the hydrophobic properties of intestinal linings. Studies indicate that materials with greater hydrophobicity, such as polystyrene and polyhydroxybutyrate, are absorbed more effectively by specific parts of the intestine compared to less hydrophobic materials. This preference for hydrophobic materials is attributed to their ability to adhere more readily to the intestinal surface, prolonging contact duration and thereby increasing absorption potential.<sup>

Achieving this requires optimal interaction between drug particles and biological surfaces.

This repulsion impedes the movement or transport of the cationic nanoparticles through the mucus layer. In contrast, anionic nanoparticles were observed to diffuse more easily among the mucus networks. This is attributed to reduced electrostatic interaction between anionic nanoparticles and the negatively charged mucins, allowing for more freedom of movement within the mucus layer.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr38-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

</sup> Overall, these findings suggest that the charge of penetrating material plays a significant role in their interaction with mucins and their ability to penetrate the mucus layer in the GI tract. It may be reasonable to conclude that the barrier function of the mucus layer is small relative to the other barriers that drugs encounter during passage across the oral mucosa. This is probably a reflection of the fact that barrier function of mucus is dependent not only on the physicochemical properties of the drug but also on the physicochemical properties of the mucus.</p><p>Some regions of the oral mucosa incorporate a keratinised layer, the outermost region, comprising an orderly array of flattened hexagonal cells filled with aggregations of cytokeratin bounded by a cell envelope and surrounded by a complex mixture of lipids.<sup>

For both these compounds tape-stripped tissue was more permeable, and the authors concluded that the keratin layer provided a significant barrier to the movement of these compounds. Based on this evidence it appears the keratinised layer, if present, presents a major barrier to drug permeability.</p><p>The morphology of the underlying non-keratinised epithelial layer presents an absorption barrier which varies according to the specific physiological site. The epithelium in the oral cavity is stratified and not tightly interconnected by junctions, but by an paracellular lipid matrix constituting a barrier for absorption. Thus, the epithelial absorption profile of drugs may vary regarding the rate and the lag time depending on both the specific mucosal epithelium targeted and the physiochemical properties of the drug. Absorption across the epithelia may occur by passive transcellular or paracellular diffusion. However, absorption may also occur because of carrier-mediated cellular uptake, as well as receptor-mediated endocytic uptake mechanisms, followed by transcytosis, which primarily takes place in monolayered mucosal epithelium. Efflux mechanisms have also been found to decrease the absorption of, primarily, small drugs across monolayer epithelia.</p><p>The paracellular transport is mainly restricted by the presence of tight junctions between the cells. This route is thus primarily for small, hydrophilic and/or charged molecules, and it is estimated to represent only 0.1% of the epithelial cell wall area.<sup>

</sup> Mucin products are also available commercially, however because of purification and processing of these mucins it is impossible to obtain rheological properties which resemble that of native mucus. It is proposed that the mixing of mucus from different sources could possibly tailor properties to better mimic the native conditions. Implementation of such methods would require rigorous standardisation, characterisation and testing to ensure reproducibility and relevance to the intended application. In terms of setting up these sorts of acellular models, usually researchers use a mucus application over a filter insert in a transwell plate insert to create donor and recipient chambers for analysis.<sup><xref rid="bibr89-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="bibr90-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></sup></p><p>Another possibility is the use of mucus-secreting cell lines, these are typically used to produce models of mucus covered epithelia, but it could be an option to harvest the mucus from cells and use this as a model itself.

Saliva aids in drug absorption through passive transport, utilising transcellular and paracellular pathways, with the choice of route dependent on the drug molecule&#8217;s characteristics.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr80-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>

</sup></p><p>Changes in the pH level of saliva can affect the way drugs are absorbed in the body. The degree of ionisation of a drug is influenced by the pH of the surrounding environment. When drugs are taken, they can passively absorb through either transcellular diffusion or paracellular diffusion, depending on their physicochemical properties. The most prevalent method, transcellular diffusion, is more efficient for drugs that are in a non-ionised state because they are more soluble in lipids. Therefore, drugs with higher pKa values, indicating a tendency to remain non-ionised, are preferred for absorption in areas like sublingual and buccal where saliva has a neutral pH. On the other hand, drugs that are hydrophilic or ionised are better absorbed through the paracellular pathway. It&#8217;s important to note that the pH of saliva can change temporarily due to factors like food and drinks or oral health issues, which can affect how drugs are absorbed when administered in sublingual and buccal routes.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>The continuous flow of saliva and swallowing actions in the oral cavity can impact drug residence time on the oral mucosa, influencing therapeutic efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr98-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="bibr99-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup> The rate at which the drug formulation breaks down and the drug dissolves can be influenced by the amount of saliva present. For instance, if the mouth is dry, this can hinder the absorption of the drug. On the other hand, excessive saliva flow can cause the drug to be swallowed before it has a chance to be absorbed through the oral mucosa.<sup>

</sup> Saliva is composed of&#8201;&gt;99% water, its pH and composition including its constituents, are influenced by the rate of saliva flow. The flow rate of saliva is highly variable and can also be affected by food intake. Increased saliva production, often stimulated by food consumption can wash away hydrophilic drugs from their site of application shortening the drug&#8217;s retention period in the oral cavity. It continuously bathes the oral mucosa, dilutes the drugs, and can lower the absorption and bioavailability of a topically administered medication and ultimately impact its therapeutic effectiveness. This phenomenon is called the &#8216;salivary washing effect&#8217;. However, it remains unclear whether the salivary secretions influence the diffusion of the deposited drug deeper into the tissue.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr100-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">100</xref></sup></p><p>Several factors such as age, medications (such as anticholinergic drugs), and medical conditions (such as Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome, cheilosis, glossodynia, dehydration, dysphagia, and mastication problems) can affect saliva flow, thereby impacting the effectiveness of buccal and sublingual drug delivery.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Serpe et al. conducted an in vitro evaluation study of salivary washout on drug delivery to the oral cavity using sulforhodamine (SRD)-coated microneedles. They found that salivary flow, both dynamic and static, increases drug penetration, which modifies the kinetics of permeation. There is also a considerable drug backwash caused by presence of a dynamic salivary flow, with 90% of the SRD lost into the donor chamber&#8217;s PBS. On the other hand, although the loss increased from 14% to 37% when the static volume of PBS in the donor chamber was increased from 100&#8201;to&#8201;300&#8201;&#956;L, this was a much less significant impact than the dynamic flow instance. This evidence implies that, in order to minimise drug loss via salivary washout, it may still be necessary to shield the area of insertion with a protective mucoadhesive covering or patch.<sup>

There are several areas where these considerations should be made to ensure the production of a reliable reproducible model, which will be discussed throughout this review. Briefly, the cell source should be carefully selected so as it is readily available, scalable, standardisable, and comparable to models used in previous studies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr102-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>
</sup> Additionally, any methods, culture vessels or other materials used in the model development need to be easily adoptable and standardisable. Many of the methods of oral mucosal model development presented throughout the literature describe the use of scaffolding materials which are fabricated in-house requiring complex assembly or customised machines for production, making adoption of the model in drug delivery studies by other groups more difficult.</p><p>The development of engineered tissue models should aim to augment and complement existing drug development models throughout the validation process. For example, existing animal models are time consuming, low throughput, difficult to analyse and poor representatives of in vivo human tissues. Therefore, here the development of complex in vitro tissue models shows promise in the advanced screening of drugs to progress to animal/clinical trial stages. However, as the biological relevance of in vitro models comes into question the models begin to become increasingly sophisticated, thus coupled with a decrease in the ease of model assembly and throughput.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr103-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>
</sup></p><p>In relation to the feasibility of using these models in drug development one should also consider the propensity for data collection from assays readily conducted in drug discovery investigations. Typically, the data output potential decreases as the complexity of a model increases, it cannot be assumed that assays developed for use with monolayer cultures are suitable for direct translation for use for 3D tissue models. A key consideration which should be made in this area is the size of molecules required for the completion of the assay and the barriers to penetration of these molecules through the 3D layers of cells for interaction with the central components of the model.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr104-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>
</sup> Some assays rely on cell lysis for functionality and penetration of reagents is necessary to achieve uniform cell lysis of all components of the model. Another example may be in relation to the diffusion of fluorescent probes and the ability for photons to penetrate the tissue model for probe excitation or fluorescent emission and the effects this may have on the ability for fluorescent imaging of the samples. Whilst optical assessment techniques which have previously been widely applied in 2D culture models have been adapted for use with 3D culture they are typically endpoint or static measurements which are time inefficient for large-scale analysis.<sup>

This needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and is dependent on the disease under investigation or the method of drug delivery to be employed in the investigated system. A significant barrier to the development of biologically relevant and complex models appears to be obtaining suitable experimental data against which the model can be validated.

This technique may be either conventional or advanced manufacturing and should aim to reduce the fabrication time and enhance the reproducibility of the final model. One of the more traditional methods of scaffold fabrication involves solvent casting particulate leaching to create highly porous matrices which have been applied to hard tissues. Typically, this technique involves the dispersion of a salt which is insoluble in a polymer solution until a homogenous dispersion is achieved. This composite solution is then solvent cast and allowed to dry via solvent evaporation, the resulting matrix is then submerged in water to facilitate leaching of the salt from the matrix. These scaffolds have been reported to yield scaffolds of up to 90% porosity with good pore interconnectivity.<sup>

The model is then built up in a layer-by-layer fashion from bottom to top requiring a steady material flow and a material which rapidly stabilises after deposition. Examples of materials frequently used in this technique include alginate and gelatin-methacrylate (GelMA) which demonstrate rapid stabilisation via interaction with calcium ions or cooling/photo-induced cross-linking respectively.

Whilst many advantages are experienced using this technique there are some limitations to the use of 3DP for tissue engineering applications. Despite the wide range of available biomaterials, not many of these demonstrate the gelling properties required to stabilise the final construct.

In some cases, this can be dependent on the availability of tissue-specific cellular phenotypes providing the capability of representing the characteristics of normal or disease state tissues. Additionally, the density of cells which can replicate the in vivo tissue should be carefully considered. As the key benefit of developing these in vitro tissue models is to close the gap between animal models and clinical trials it is most appropriate to use human cells in the model development.</p><p>Most of the in vitro models currently described utilise adult primary cells which have been isolated from patients. These cells are isolated from tissue biopsies, healthy or diseased, and therefore represent well the functional in vivo tissue; however, some problems are presented when using these primary cell sources. Firstly, these cells have a limited lifespan and demonstrate slow proliferation rates. Additionally, the isolation procedures can be complex and there is potential for contamination with unwanted cell types.</p><p>To overcome issues associated with primary cell isolation one may opt for the use of immortalised cell lines due to ease of access, expandability, and reproducibility. Many models have been developed using immortalised cell lines however, the behaviour of these is not always similar to cells harvested from in vivo biopsies.<sup><xref rid="bibr147-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,<xref rid="bibr148-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">148</xref></sup> Elsewhere, Buskermolen et al.<sup>

Their study compared the use of immortalised cell lines in the development of a model to their primary cell equivalents, showing similarities between the two models produced. Therefore, it is concluded that the similarities of immortalised cell lines to primary cell equivalents for use in the production of in vitro tissue models should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>To overcome limitations with both primary cell cultures and immortalised cell lines for in vitro modelling, stem cells have been investigated in some areas.<sup><xref rid="bibr150-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,<xref rid="bibr151-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">151</xref></sup> These are undifferentiated cells which can be isolated from a range of different sources: embryos, foetuses, and adult tissues such as bone marrow and other stem cell niches are all sources of stem cells. Stem cells can self-renew and differentiate into numerous cell types, with the differentiation potential being dependent on the original stem cell source and subsequent environmental stimuli encountered. The key limitations of using stem cells are the ability to control the differentiation pathways towards the desired lineage and the fact that differentiated stem cells often display immature phenotype with gene expressions equivalent to that found in foetal cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr152-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>,<xref rid="bibr153-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">153</xref></sup> Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have been engineered from differentiated somatic cells via the induced over expression of specific transcription factors.<sup>

These stimuli can influence factors such as mitosis, cell shape, cellular spreading and proliferation and secretion of ECM components. Additionally, in vivo, the presence of a vascular system throughout tissue ensures the adequate provision of nutrient supply and waste removal. During the design of in vitro models, it should be considered that cells in the centre of the organoid may be behaving differently to superficial cells depending on the ability of nutrients to reach the centre of the construct. Often the prevention of successful in vitro model development has been caused by limited nutrient and waste diffusion. To avoid this limitation mechanisms such as mechanical and chemical signals can be used. These stimuli were traditionally induced using bioreactors designed to reproduce the in vivo growth conditions, however, recently novel platforms based on microfluidics have become important tools which can be used for this purpose.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr156-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>
</sup> Using microfluidics in this application has shown promise due to an excellent potential to reproduce sophisticated in vitro organ models, such as the skin. The technology employed here incorporated an automated and biomimetic system to better simulate the dynamic environment encountered in vivo. Microfluidic systems may incorporate in situ biosensors for non-invasive testing which can further aid in the realm of drug discovery and testing.<sup>

</sup></p><p>An additional consideration is the selection of culture media for co-culture conditions. The culture media is used to nourish cells usually consisting of the base medium, serum and regulating factors. The specificities in these compositions are important as they determine cell fate and differ for each cell type. Establishing an appropriate medium when two or more cell types are present becomes challenging. Several approaches have been described in attempts to overcome these limitations. Mixed medium is the most simplistic of the methods here and involves mixing the culture media for all cell types present in an appropriate blend ratio.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr158-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>
</sup> It should be considered that the supplements present within some media may interfere with other cell types within the co-culture. Another approach is to use a very general base medium and supplement it with soluble factors which can stimulate one cell type without negatively effecting the others, offering more specific modulation of the media than just mixing two complete medium compositions. Unfortunately, it is time consuming and difficult to find suitable supplements to optimise the combined media. Finally, a culture system enabling two partitioned media flows can be used, meaning that each cell type in a co-culture can receive their respective media whilst cell-cell contact is maintained.<sup>

This includes several models of the oral mucosa. Designed models aim to mimic as closely as possible the native tissue environment in which the DDS will be administered, therefore each complex in vitro model should be tailored to the specific final application. This may introduce complexities within models for testing of DDSs which are for local treatment of diseases, for example infections or trauma injuries to the oral mucosa. In cases such as these the in vitro model should be designed to incorporate characteristics of the disease/injury state. Whereas, for the testing of a DDS designed for systemic delivery via an oral transmucosal mechanism an in vitro model of the healthy oral mucosa may be appropriate. Since 1995 researchers have been working to develop in vitro models of the oral tissues. In this year a group produced an in vitro oral epithelial model to investigate cell permeability to adrenoreceptor antagonists.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr160-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>

Models have been designed to cover investigation of healthy, ulcerative, fungal and bacterial infection state oral mucosa. Within the following section the development of such models will be discussed.</p><sec id="section13-20417314241313458"><title>Healthy oral mucosa</title><p>An in vitro model of the oral mucosa with permeability characteristics comparable to normal oral mucosa was first described by Selvaratnam et al.<sup>

</sup> Keratinocytes obtained from several sources; buccal mucosa, hard palate and abdominal skin were cultured on a commercial collagen membrane (Cellagen<sup>&#174;</sup>) or on dead decellularized dermal tissue. These cultures were initially grown in submerged conditions before exposure to the air-liquid interface. By enlarge the keratinocytes grown on the decellularized tissue displayed morphology closer to that of native tissue presenting with a thicker epithelial layer, ordered stratification and a polarised basal layer with good attachment to the substrate. The oral models investigated displayed water permeability characteristics similar to that of the corresponding native tissues (buccal and hard palate). Analysis of lipid production showed that all models contained the major lipid groups usually found in epithelial tissues. Despite the presence of phospholipids being significantly decreased for the in vitro model tissues other lipid groups and sterols such as cholesterol, glucosylceramides and ceramides were comparable to native tissues in most cases. Given the similarities in permeability properties of the models described by this group they could serve as good in vitro drug testing platforms for the oral mucosa.</p><p>In 2003 Costea et al.<sup>

</sup> described the necessity of fibroblasts and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to produce oral mucosal models with morphological similarities to in vivo tissue. Results showed that whilst models without fibroblasts were able to stratify in a monoculture of keratinocytes on a collagen matrix, the resulting model epithelia were thin with loose attachment to the collagen matrix in comparison to native epithelia. Co-culturing the keratinocytes atop a fibroblast embedded collagen matrix significantly increased the epithelium thickness from 28 to 66.1&#8201;&#181;m. The effect of KGF appeared to increase the model epithelial thickness regardless of the presence of fibroblasts. This response was dose dependent, with the mucosal thickness increasing as the concentration of KGF increased. This trend was also observed with the fibroblast embedded models where the co-culture system incorporating 10&#8201;ng/ml KGF bearing the greatest similarity in overall thickness to native mucosal epithelium. Additionally, this model performed closest to the native oral epithelium in the other aspects such as proliferation and apoptotic indices in both the basal and suprabasal cell layers. It was concluded that the inclusion of fibroblasts in the model had a more profound effect on the proliferation and differentiation of in vitro model oral mucosa than the inclusion of KGF, therefore this model was used in further studies for pharmacological applications.<sup>

</sup> The models were used to assess the effect of glycerol, which is often used as a treatment for dry mouth in clinical settings, on epithelial homoeostasis and tissue integrity. Matured oral epithelial models were exposed to different concentrations of glycerol (17%, 42.5% and 85%) and analysed using immunohistochemistry, H&amp;E staining and Ki-67 staining. Results showed that the high concentrations of glycerol&#8201;&gt;&#8201;42.5% caused increased epithelial cell proliferation, thickness and apoptosis compared to controls treated with water only. E-cadherin staining showed no significant changes in the tissue integrity following treatment of the tissue engineered oral mucosae. This research showed the successful application of the in vitro oral mucosal models to pharmaceutical testing, consolidating the usefulness of these models for drug discovery and validation.</p><p>An early comprehensive investigation of 10 natural/synthetic biomaterial scaffolds in conjunction with a co-culture of fibroblasts and keratinocytes isolated from biopsies was performed by Moharamzadeh et al.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr165-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>
</sup> Studies performed by the group highlight the importance of biocompatibility, biostability and porosity of the scaffold material selected to successfully mimic the oral mucosa for in vitro testing applications. Pore size drastically effected the fibroblast infiltration and interaction with keratinocytes as models utilising commercial collagen and collagen/elastin materials with poor porosity demonstrated little to no interaction between the two cell types. Whilst porosity was an important factor this should be closely controlled as highly porous scaffold morphologies resulted in keratinocyte invasion leading to the formation of epithelial islands throughout the scaffold structure. Therefore, lamination of non-commercial synthetic scaffolds using Matrigel<sup>&#174;</sup> improved the formation of separated, well-developed epithelial layers. Additionally, the importance of exposure of the construct to the air-liquid interface is highlighted as a driver of epithelial differentiation. In this study the biomaterial which best supported the development of a multi-layered stratified epithelium was a freeze-dried collagen-GAG scaffold with Matrigel<sup>&#174;</sup> lamination prior to keratinocyte seeding. The co-culture system combined with this biomaterial supported fibroblasts within the scaffold spaces capable of producing connective tissue components. Additionally, this in vitro model supported the differentiation of the TR146 keratinocyte cell line to form a non-keratinised superficial epithelial layer.</p><p>In other 3-D tissue models researchers have utilised commercially available biomaterials such as collagen-elastin matrix (Matriderm<sup>&#174;</sup>) alongside co-culture systems of fibroblasts and keratinocytes for the development of an in vitro oral mucosal model.<sup>

</sup> Fibroblasts were allowed to infill the Matriderm<sup>&#174;</sup> matrix and mature for 14&#8201;days in vitro before seeding of keratinocytes atop the developed fibroblast layers. After a total of 3&#8201;weeks culturing of the model in submersed conditions the model was lifted to the air-liquid interface and cultured in media supplemented with ascorbate-2-phosphate (A2P) and human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS) for 10&#8201;days. The model successfully supported the growth and differentiation of the gingival fibroblasts and keratinocytes for the duration of the study. At 2&#8201;weeks post-seeding with the fibroblasts, they had successfully infiltrated and covered the Matriderm<sup>&#174;</sup> forming a dermal area. This surface was well receptive to the settling and development of a keratinocyte layer as the large pores in the scaffold had become infilled with fibroblasts. Following the exposure of the construct to the air-liquid interface with modified media for 10&#8201;days, the development of a continuous epithelial layer was formed, suggestive of the potential for a functional barrier epithelium in the completed model.

The bone model was supported using porous ceramic hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate discs, the model was maintained in a spinner bioreactor using a rat osteosarcoma-derived cell line as the cell source. For the development of the mucosal portion of the model a freeze-dried collagen scaffold was used in combination with a co-culture of primary fibroblasts and immortalised human oral epithelial cells (OKF6-TERET-2). Following combination of the constructs the model was further cultured at the air-liquid interface for 5&#8201;days to induce differentiation.

This is an extremely important factor in utilising in vitro models for the investigation of drug delivery studies. This model used the TR146 cell line in a range of different culture conditions to optimise the development of a clinically relevant model with barrier functions comparable to native mucosal tissue. Using the air-lift cultivation technique during these studies resulted in increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, especially when cultivated using EpiLife media as opposed to DMEM. Following further investigations using supplementation of DMEM with factors such as hydrocortisone, human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS), KGF, A2P and foetal calf serum (FCS) under both submerged and air-lift culture conditions it was concluded that the most representative barrier function was obtained using DMEM supplemented with 1% HKGS and 10% FCS under air-lift conditions. HKGS contains EGF and hydrocortisone which have been shown to enhance differentiation of epidermal barriers and to promote tightness of neural endothelial cells respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr171-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">171</xref><xref rid="bibr172-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr173-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">173</xref></sup> The optimal culture conditions described here not only proved to increase the barrier membrane function via TEERs investigation, additionally a high-throughput qPCR investigation confirmed the expression of several tight junction markers in the optimised model, showing similar expression to samples extracted from biopsies of oral mucosa.

A further 14&#8201;days incubation in air-lift conditions was then undertaken using media supplemented with calcium chloride to continue driving differentiation. Histological characterisation showed normal tissue attributions such as a cubic morphology of basal cells whilst the stratum intermedium displayed both cubic and polygonal cells with centrally located nuclei. The stratum corneum presented flattened cells with squamous morphology. The entire model had a thickness of about 150&#8201;&#181;m and 8&#8211;12 single cell layers. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the model produced by this group represented a non-cornified stratified epithelium as CK-13 and CK-14 were abundantly expressed in the stratum intermedium and basal respectively.</p><p>Given the information presented here it appears no matter the biomaterial support structures used for the model, there are several common themes throughout the literature in regard to producing clinically relevant in vitro oral mucosal models (<xref rid="fig3-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Whilst early models focussed on the harvesting of primary cells from tissue biopsies, in recent years there seems to have been a shift in practice to use immortalised cell lines. The benefit of this is that it enhances model reproducibility, which is sacrificed when using primary cultures due to donor-donor variability. The culture conditions throughout the model development and maturation have a significant effect on the production of a barrier type membrane similar to that found in the in vivo oral mucosa. Evidence presented here suggests that the most important considerations to make here are the media supplementation during keratinocyte culture development, and exposure of the model at the air-liquid interface. Both factors appear to play a role in driving the differentiation of the keratinocytes and formation of the barrier layer important for investigations such as drug permeability studies.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3-20417314241313458" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The general steps described to produce most of the in vitro mucosal models described throughout the literature, involving the infiltration of a 3D matrix with fibroblasts followed by subsequent maturation and topping with keratinocytes which are allowed to mature, stratify and cornify to produce a barrier epithelium.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10.1177_20417314241313458-fig3.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="section14-20417314241313458"><title>Disease states</title><p>Whilst mucosal models of healthy oral mucosa are ideal for testing permeability and diffusion rate of drugs intended for delivery systemically via the blood stream, in cases of local delivery to injury/infection sites of the oral mucosa itself these models would not be suitable representatives of the target anatomy.

Presence of the mucosal model negatively impacted the number of bacterial cells residing in the biofilm, additionally, the size, complexity, and diversity of the biofilm changed when co-cultured with the mucosal model. On the other hand, a wound healing study showed the effect that the presence of the biofilm had a negative effect on wound recovery at 48&#8201;h in both complex models using either TR146 tumour derived cell line or a human keratinocyte derived from a non-tumorigenic source (HaCaT). This model is advantageous as the filter separation of the microbial biofilm from the complex mucosal model facilitates the independent analysis of the biofilm from the mucosa.

In vivo model systems have been invaluable tools to validate and complement in vitro findings. Yet, they are more expensive, low-throughput and their translatability is still debatable due to species differences. These limitations have prompted to develop ex vivo systems, which sought to decrease the knowledge gap between in vitro and in vivo models. One important advantage of ex vivo systems over traditional in vitro systems or even organ-on-a-chip systems is that it preserves the surface topography and 3D architecture of the native tissues. A growing body of evidence clearly supports that nano- and microscale surface topography has a huge influence on both bacterial attachment and bacterial signalling in the ex vivo modelling of mucosal infectious disease such as biofilm formation.<sup><xref rid="bibr209-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>,<xref rid="bibr210-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">210</xref></sup> For instance, using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication, it was found that stable coexistence of interacting bacteria requires a defined microscale structure.<sup>

</sup> further confirming the role of physiochemical regulation of biofilm formation. Lastly, the use of ex vivo tissues allow experiments to be performed in a more physiologically relevant environment that would otherwise be restricted from using in vivo models due to ethical issues. For these reasons, many ex vivo biofilm model systems are developed using tissues from both animals and human donors, including ex vivo dental and oral mucosal models. As a disadvantage, maintaining ex vivo models for a prolonged period is still a challenge. Depending on the size and geometry of the ex vivo tissues, an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen throughout the tissue may also be an issue.</p><p>This narrative review&#8217;s objective is to discuss the state-of-the-art oral mucosal models &#8211; which are not commercially available &#8211; used to assess the DDSs, paying special attention to more ambitious modelling techniques for different disease states.

<xref rid="bibr220-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>
</sup> the authors utilised an MTT assay to evaluate the mucosa viability before and after permeability tests, thus comparing the cell viability of five different mucosal models extracted and preserved under different modalities and conditions. In particular, the media utilised were phosphate buffer solution (PBS), Kreb&#8217;s bicarbonate Ringer&#8217;s solution (KRP), KRP&#8201;+&#8201;1% foetal bovine serum (FBS), and KRP&#8201;+&#8201;1% FBS in a CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The mucosa ex vivo models were rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs and humans. The separation of the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue by heat treatment resulted in an epithelial thickness of approximately 500&#8201;&#956;m without compromising the permeability and integrity characteristics of all different mucosae. Specifically, the authors placed oral mucosa (used in the permeability experiments) on a 6-well plate and cut the sample. A solution of MTT was added to each well, and after 4&#8201;h of incubation, the cells were lysed, and the formazan crystals were solubilised by DMSO. Thus, the absorbance at 540&#8201;nm was measured in each well, and the viability was determined relative to fresh mucosa, which was assumed to be 100% viable.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr220-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>
</sup> The obtained results confirmed that mucosae maintained their maximum integrity in KRP at 4&#176;C for 36&#8201;h without using any other protectant. Moreover, the authors reported that in the presence of selected cryoprotectants (20% glycerol and 20% trehalose), the mucosae, which were frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C and thawed at 37&#176;C, exhibited preserved integrity and biological viability for 21&#8201;days. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the experimental conditions to standardise the process of isolating, maintaining, and determining the viability of mucosa and thus improve the accuracy of permeability studies.<sup>

One tube is attached to the inlet port of the receptor side to receive the receptor solution by a peristaltic pump. A glass chamber is included into the donor chamber and its inlet port is connected to the drug solution. Then, the glass donor chamber is filled with the drug solution. The donor and receptor solutions are perfused in the same direction.<sup>

</sup> validated this method by testing the transport of drugs (mannitol, L-glucose, D-glucose, methoxy inulin, naproxen and progesterone) across rabbit intestinal mucosa and comparing the permeability results to another diffusion cell, the Ussing chamber. Briefly, the tissue was assembled at the same manner that in the Ussing chamber but preheating the cells at 37&#176;C. Then, the cells were placed in an aluminium block heater and the reservoirs were filled with warmed oxygenated buffer solution that circulates by a carbogen gas (O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>) through the reservoirs. At different time-points, the samples were collected from the receptor chamber and immediately replaced with the same receptor medium. The permeability parameters showed no statistical differences in both methods. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated several advantages of the Sweetana-Grass diffusion chamber over the Ussing chamber. The diffusion cells have only one material type (acrylic) responsible for reducing the probability of leakage. On the other hand, the Ussing chamber has two or three different materials (glass from the reservoir, acrylic from the cell and the connecting tubing). The temperature of the system is easier to control, since the cells and the surface area of the device are heated at the same time, unlike the Ussing chamber that only the fluid of the reservoir is heated. The cleaning is faster and more efficient than the Ussing chamber. The fluid low is parallel to the surfaces of the tissue, reproducing exactly the in vivo conditions. The volume of the reservoir is lower than the reservoir of the Ussing chamber, allowing the quantification of drugs with low permeability. For these reasons, Sweetana-Grass diffusion chamber can be used as alternative to Ussing chamber in the assessment of drug that permeate mucosal tissue. However, this method is not so practical than the Ussing chamber since it requires the separation of the reservoirs from the heating/circulating bath. Moreover, this apparatus cannot be used for electrophysiologic measurements as Ussing chamber.<sup>

</sup> In this model 12 extracted human single-rooted anterior teeth with complete root formation were selected for having comparable root canal space and apical foramina by using periapical radiography. The teeth were completely free from restorations with no previous endodontic treatment. The teeth were autoclaved before use and then stored in sodium azide solution. All teeth were subject to periapical radiographs in the buccolingual and mesiodistal planes. The total two-dimensional area of the root canal space in both projections, as well as the width of the apical foramina, was measured. Five teeth were allocated to the occlusal loading group and five to the static group (no loading). Endodontic access preparations were prepared, and the working length of the canals was established at 1&#8201;mm short of the apex. Root canal preparations were performed by using the Vortex rotary system to size 35 with a 0.06 taper, followed by irrigation with 2&#8201;ml of 5.25% NaOCl. The teeth were then irrigated and stored in 5% sodium thiosulfate for 1&#8201;min to inactivate the hypochlorite, and all the teeth were autoclaved. Twenty microlitres of one McFarland concentrations of S. intermedius bacterial suspension in thioglycolate broth was transferred to each of the root canals. The roots were incubated anaerobically for 21&#8201;days in 100% humidity to allow colonisation of the bacteria on the canal wall and into the dentinal tubules. A similar concentration of bacterial suspension of the bacteria was added every week. After 21&#8201;days of inoculation, all samples were loaded to the test apparatus.</p><p>The apparatus (<xref rid="fig7-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(a)</xref>) consisted of a modified plastic vial with two chambers separated by a thin built-in diaphragm with a small opening created to allow 3&#8201;mm of the tooth root to suspend into the lower chamber containing dental transport medium. The upper chamber of the vial was filled with polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) (to mimic the periodontal ligament) so that the crown is exposed, and the root surface from the cementoenamel junction to a level 3&#8201;mm short of the apex is enclosed by the PVS. The five experimental teeth were then mounted into their respective apparatuses. Once the lower chamber was filled with dental transport medium, a plastic screw cap at the base of the plastic tube of each apparatus was tightened to secure closure (<xref rid="fig7-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(b)</xref>). The apparatuses were mounted to the lower sample holder of a chewing simulator. After a simulated chewing equivalent to 1&#8201;year of function (240,000 cycles over 3&#8201;days) at a dynamic force of 117&#8201;N for the experimental dynamic loading group, 0.5&#8201;ml aliquots of the respective bacterial transport media were collected from the lower chamber of all specimens (static and dynamic) by aspirating through the bottom of the plastic screw cap Quantitative bacterial presence in the bottom chamber was assessed by counting the CFUs. The result demonstrated a significantly higher CFUs in the dynamic group, whereas the static group showed much lower growth. Moreover, the static group showed no periapical bacterial extrusion and there was no statistically significant interaction between the type of bacteria and chewing simulation.</p></sec><sec id="section35-20417314241313458"><title><italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> modelling for oral mucosal reconstruction</title><p>Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons are often confronted with the need for a mucosal lining for oral reconstruction after trauma, surgical resection, or pre-prosthetic surgery. Mucosal reconstruction of the oral cavity has involved the use of either split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) or palatal oral mucosal grafts, both of which require a second surgical procedure. The STSG has a distinct disadvantage in its texture, and the palatal oral mucosa is limited in supp1y<sup>
<xref rid="bibr269-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>
</sup> which encourages the production of oral mucosa equivalents. The production of an oral mucosa equivalent consists of two steps: Keratinocyte cultivation (primary cell culture) and the production of the oral mucosa equivalent on a scaffold. In the past, the technique of Rheinwald and Green has been used to fabricate cultured oral epithelial sheets. Their protocol uses a feeder layer composed of irradiated 3T3 mouse fibroblasts to grow keratinocytes in vitro.<sup><xref rid="bibr270-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>,<xref rid="bibr271-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">271</xref></sup> However, these models are undesirable in elective surgery because of the undetermined risk of introducing a high mouse DNA content onto proliferating human cells.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr278-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>
</sup> It has a polarity by which one side of the material has a basal lamina to grow epithelial cells on, and the other side, an underlying porous dermal matrix, allows in growth of fibroblasts and angiogenic cells.<sup>

</sup> In addition, the AlloDerm has handling characteristics that would allow for the application and stabilisation of the oral mucosal composite within the oral cavity. In this study Billingham and Reynolds have developed a composite human oral mucosal equivalent without the use of an irradiated mouse feeder layer and in a defined culture medium, which may be suitable for intraoral grafting procedures. To produce this ex vivo composite firstly AlloDerm was cut into circular pieces with a 11.3&#8201;mm diameter to conform to the area of a 48-well micro plate. The circular samples were rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline without Ca<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>++</sup> and placed into the 48-well culture plate with 100&#8201;&#181;l FBS for 1&#8201;h to enhance attachment of seeded keratinocytes. The keratinised oral tissue samples from masticatory mucosa were collected from patients having dental extractions, pre-prosthetic surgeries and gingivectomies. The oral mucosal keratinocytes were cultivated using enzymatic method.<sup>

Trypsin activity was inhibited by soybean tissue inhibitor. Disaggregated cells were collected, counted, centrifuged and resuspended. Cells of different concentrations were placed on l cm<sup>2</sup> pieces of AlloDerm and incubated with MCDB 153 medium, containing a high concentration of calcium. After 6&#8201;h the medium was changed to remove the added FBS. The oral keratinocyte-AlloDerm composites were cultured submerged for 4&#8201;days in the 48-well culture plate. After incubating the composites, they were transferred to an organotypic tissue culture flask and allowed the composites to grow at an air-liquid interface. Which encourages stratification of epithelial layer. The rehydrated AlloDerm showed no evidence of any cellular components (<xref rid="fig7-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(c)</xref>) and consisted of interlacing dense collagen bundles of varying sizes, indicating that the structural integrity of the ECM was intact.

The direct explant technique has also been used for 30&#8201;years in the culturing of human oral tissues.<sup><xref rid="bibr284-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>,<xref rid="bibr285-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">285</xref></sup> In the direct explant technique, the cells from the initial tissue extraction affixed to a culture dish migrate out of the tissue starting from the edges of the fragment, adhering to and multiplying on the culture dish. It has been suggested that direct explant technique is more successful than the enzymatic technique in culturing human oral keratinocytes.<sup><xref rid="bibr286-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>,<xref rid="bibr287-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">287</xref></sup> Thus, Bayar et al. developed an optimised version of the original direct explant to obtain keratinocyte culture and produce &#8216;ex-vivo produced oral mucosa equivalents&#8217; (EVPOME). In this study, the oral mucosal keratinocytes were cultivated by direct explant technique where each tissue specimen were cut into 8&#8211;10 pieces, approximately 1&#8201;mm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1&#8201;mm in size, and placed in the different culture flasks followed by incubation with culture media (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100&#8201;U/ml penicillin, 100&#8201;&#956;g/ml streptomycin and 0.5% amphotericin B (<xref rid="fig7-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(e)</xref>).

</sup></p><p>This method of EVPOME production depicted 100% success in keratinocyte cultivation along with that the average number of days required for epithelial cells to grow and migrate out from the tissue origin was around 9&#8211;10&#8201;days and it took a total of 20&#8201;days for the cells to become fully confluent. Moreover, histological evaluation of &#8216;EVPOME&#8217;s showed multilayered epithelium comprising basal, suprabasal, and parakeratinised layers. The epithelial architecture of &#8216;EVPOME&#8217;s resembled that of normal oral mucosa. Highly stratified &#8216;EVPOME&#8217;s showed evidence of parakeratosis. Keratinocytes of the basal layer were cuboid, and they were aligned along the &#8216;AlloDerm&#8217; surface. Under the basal layer of &#8216;EVPOME&#8217;s, &#8216;AlloDerm&#8217; showed no evidence of any cellular components and consisted of interlacing dense collagen bundles of varying sizes, indicating that the structural integrity of the ECM was intact. The thickness of the epithelial sheet was measured to be 3&#8211;7 cell-layers in &#8216;EVPOME&#8217; and 7&#8211;20 cell-layer in the original tissue sample (<xref rid="fig7-20417314241313458" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(f)</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section36-20417314241313458"><title>Limitations of <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> modelling</title><p>Although ex vivo models provide a cheap and high-throughput alternative to in vivo models, they share some common limitations. Based on the above-mentioned scientific literature, it can be concluded that ex vivo models are optimal for both the analysis of drug permeability and for reducing the number of in vivo experiments; however, due to atherogenicity related to tissue origin and preparation, these models cannot completely replace in vivo tests, even if more recent publications are making progress in standardising and automating many experimental procedures.<sup><xref rid="bibr288-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>,<xref rid="bibr289-20417314241313458" ref-type="bibr">289</xref></sup> In addition, similar to in vitro models, one of the major disadvantages of the ex vivo model is the lack of natural immune systems. Migration of cells from blood into the experimental tissue during immune responses cannot be assessed. Culturing conditions in ex vivo models can also deviate from the natural environment found in animal models, although synthetic media has been developed to mimic the native environment.
