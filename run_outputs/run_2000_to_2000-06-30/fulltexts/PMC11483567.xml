To prepare the dialysate, at least 120&#160;L of water are needed for one 4-h session with a dialysate flow (Qd) set at 500&#160;mL/min. A lower dialysate flow rate is associated with a significant reduction in the amount of water used. The aim of this study was to check whether change of Qd from 500&#160;mL/min to 300&#160;mL/min has a significant impact on dialysis adequacy.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a retrospective analysis. Due to administrative issues, a satellite dialysis center reduced their dialysate flow to 300&#160;mL/min for a month. The center then increased Qd to 500&#160;mL/min again. We analyzed laboratory data from 3&#160;months before dialysate flow reduction, in the month with Qd reduced to 300&#160;mL/min, and from 3&#160;months thereafter with Qd set at 500&#160;mL/min.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-four people were included in the final analysis.

Unfortunately, 27% of world population does not have access to safely managed drinking water [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With climate change being the biggest global health threat of the 21st century [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] the environmental impact of our everyday practices must be examined.</p><p>Nephrology is a resource-intensive specialty. Hemodialysis in particular consumes a lot of resources and has a high carbon footprint compared with other medical therapies [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis produce a lot of consumable and disposal waste. These are the many reasons that prompted some nephrologists to promote &#8220;green nephrology,&#8221; or Blue Planet dialysis [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A global and inclusive initiative GREEN-K (Global Environmental Evolution in Nephrology and Kidney Care) with a mission to &#8220;promote and support environmentally sustainable and resilient kidney care globally through advocacy, education, and collaboration&#8221; was announced in 2023 [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Hemodialysis is certainly a lifesaving procedure but its impact on the environment is tremendous. A standard dialysis session lasts 4&#160;h, and with a dialysate flow (Qd) of 500&#160;mL/min requires 120&#160;L of ultrapure water. Due to the inefficiency of reverse osmosis filtration, additional water is needed to prime, rinse and sterilize the system, all this might add up to as many as 500&#160;L of water used for one hemodialysis session. All that is not used becomes waste (up to 380&#160;L per session) and although some centers try to use this as so-called greywater (e.g. for cleaning and toilet flushing) [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], new ways are needed to minimize water use.</p><p>A lower dialysate flow rate is associated with a significant reduction in the amount of water used for the hemodialysis procedure. Lowering the Qd has a potential negative impact however, as it might reduce the delivered single-pool Kt/V. Few reports trying to answer the question of whether dialysate flow can be safely reduced in hemodialysis patients have been published, and the results were mixed [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;13</xref>]. The aim of this study was to check whether change of dialysate flow from 500&#160;mL/min to 300&#160;mL/min has a significant impact on dialysis adequacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study design</title><p>During the COVID-19 surge in January 2022, due to administrative issues in a satellite dialysis center dialysate flow was reduced to 300&#160;mL/min.

On the other hand, it conveys important benefits, as theoretically lowering the dialysate flow from 500 to 300&#160;mL/min saves at least 48&#160;L per dialysis session (when accounting only for the produced dialysate) and reduces the plastic waste burden generated by dialysate concentrate canisters. In the studied dialysis unit (26 patients), assuming 156 dialysis sessions per patient/year it would mean a reduction in water use of 194&#160;688&#160;L per year. If we added to that calculation water of which less is rejected in the reverse osmosis process, less energy used during water purification process the magnitude of savings would be even greater.</p><p>Since the 1960s, the dialysate flow has been kept stable at 500&#160;mL/min all around the world. During that time, however, we have changed the dialyzers that are used for our procedures, which may be one factor allowing the change of the standard prescription. On the other hand, it might have been possible before, as the first report of a patient dialyzed successfully for over a year with a dialysate flow of 100&#160;mL/min comes from the group of Professor Belding Scribner [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The Qd/Qb ratio decreased significantly from 1.99 (1.95&#8211;2.00) at Qd 500&#160;mL/min to 1.18 (1.15&#8211;1.20) at Qd 300&#160;mL/min, and returned to 1.99 (1.95&#8211;2.00) after increasing Qd to 500&#160;mL/min [Friedman's &#967;&#178; = 35.6, <italic toggle="yes">P&#160;</italic>&lt;&#160;.001]. Therefore, it seems that contrary to prior studies [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] the flow ratio does not have to be fixed at 2:1 to achieve dialysis efficiency and that water can be saved without changes made to Qb.</p><p>The first larger study was published in 1981, on 20 carefully selected, stable dialysis patients being treated with a Qd of 300&#160;mL/min for 24&#160;months [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The authors reported no difference in weight, blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, creatinine, bicarbonate or potassium, and no adverse symptoms. The Kt/V was not analyzed due to the fact that it was developed by Gotch and Sargent in 1985 [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], so it is unknown whether modern measures of dialysis adequacy were attained in the study.</p><p>The next study was done on 23 hemodialysis patients and involved changing the dialysis prescription from Qd of 300&#160;mL/min to 500&#160;mL/min and finally 800&#160;mL/min for at least 3&#160;weeks [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast to our study and the few others reported, it was the only negative study. The authors did see a meaningful difference in Kt/V with different dialysate flow rates. They reported the proportion of patients not achieving adequacy and it was 56%, 30% and 13%, respectively, for greater dialysate flow rates. We are unable to fully explain why this study reported different results, although the percentage of patients not reaching the desired Kt/V was large and the authors attribute it to the &#8220;individualized dialysis prescription&#8221; in their center which takes into account residual renal function.</p><p>The only modern long-term study (6&#160;years of observation, 71 patients) of Qd reduction&#8212;400&#160;mL/min versus 500&#160;mL/min&#8212;comes from Colombia and has been reported as an abstract only [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The positive outcome of the study must be therefore interpreted with caution and cannot be fully considered until a peer-reviewed publication is made available.</p><p>The most recent study on the safety of reducing dialysate flow in the dialysis prescription is the one performed by Solomon <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The study population was similar to ours&#8212;they analyzed 30 patients, also dialyzed for 1&#160;month but with three different hemodialysis prescriptions: Qd of 500&#160;mL/min and a temperature of 37&#176;C, Qd of 500&#160;mL/min and a temperature of 38.5&#176;C, and Qd of 300&#160;mL/min and a temperature of 38.5&#176;C. They reported no significant difference in the achieved mean URR or single-pool Kt/V between the compared prescriptions. Unfortunately, due to the concerns of potential hemodynamic instability with higher temperatures patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of &lt;40%, recurrent intradialytic hypotension and autonomic neuropathy were excluded. The study, unlike ours, did not include a group dialyzed with a Qd of 300&#160;mL/min and a standard temperature. They did not report any patient discomfort due to the high temperature, but did witness an episode of symptomatic hypotension resulting in dialysis termination. They did not report on potassium levels in the studied patients, and we well know that hypokalemia is associated with hypothermia [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the converse might be also true (higher potassium levels at higher temperature) as temperature-dependent K+ channels probably play a role in the observed potassium changes [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We, on the other hand, report on potassium removal during the study period. The finding that the mean increase of predialysis potassium evoked by decrease in Qd from 500&#160;mL/min to 300&#160;mL/min was 0.28 (95% CI 0.05&#8211;0.5) mmol/L, which suggests that decreasing blood flow might not be appropriate in patients with high predialysis potassium levels.</p><p>Our study is not without several limitations. First of all, it was retrospective in nature and the number of studied patients is small. The population might not representative (probably due to small numbers)&#8212;e.g. only 17% had diabetes. Dialysate flow was changed only for a period of 1&#160;month, so it is hard to extrapolate on what would be the long-term consequences of such dialysis prescription. The follow-up period is also short. We unfortunately (due to the retrospective nature of the study) were not able to check any patient-reported outcome measures. Nevertheless, it proves that such trials probably can be done safely, and should be done if we want to minimize water usage and plastic waste generation. On the other hand, the main strength of our study is that no patients in the center were excluded due to e.g. age, low EF, recurrent symptomatic hypotension or other reasons, and we changed only one parameter&#8212;the dialysate flow&#8212;with other prescribed factors (especially temperature) being identical which makes the interpretation easier. It suggests that at least in the short-term a Qd of 300&#160;mL/min does not cause significant changes in URR or Kt/V and might be safe in patients without high predialysis potassium levels.</p><p>Whether green, blue or gray, new ways are needed to make hemodialysis ecofriendly and to use water consciously. Minimizing the dialysate flow might be one of them, as shown in this small study. Larger, long-term, randomized studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>K.K., I.G. and A.P. declare no conflict of interest, T.H. received a subvention from Medical University of Bia&#322;ystok funding the study, honoraria for lectures from AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bayer and Sanofi, payment for expert testimony from AstraZeneca, and support for attending meetings from AstraZeneca and Sandoz.
