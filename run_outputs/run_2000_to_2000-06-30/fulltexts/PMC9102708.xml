Forty dogs were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 dogs. All dogs received levobupivacaine (4 blocks) with DEX IO (infraorbital block, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) or IA (inferior alveolar block, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) or placebo (PLC; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) or DEX (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) was injected intravenously (IV) after administration of levobupivacaine. The dose of DEX was always 0.5 &#181;g/kg. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded, and blood was drawn for the quantification of DEX in plasma using LC-MS/MS. Heart rate was lower in all LB + DEX groups, while mean arterial pressure (MAP) was higher in the LB + DEX IV and LB + DEX IA groups compared to the LB + PLC IV group. Compared to DEX IV, IO and IA administration resulted in lower MAP up to 2 min after application. Absorption of DEX was faster at IO administration (C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> were 0.47 &#177; 0.08 ng/mL and 7.22 &#177; 1.28 min and 0.76 &#177; 0.09 ng/mL and 7.50 &#177; 1.63 min for the IO and IA block, respectively). The IA administration resulted in better bioavailability and faster elimination (t<sub>1/2</sub> was 63.44 &#177; 24.15 min and 23.78 &#177; 3.78 min for the IO and IA block, respectively). Perineural administration of DEX may be preferable because of the less pronounced cardiovascular response compared to IV administration.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>regional anesthesia</kwd><kwd>nerve blocks</kwd><kwd>local anesthetics</kwd><kwd>adjuvant</kwd><kwd>dog</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Slovenian Research Agency</funding-source><award-id>P4-0053</award-id><award-id>P3-0067</award-id><award-id>P1-0143</award-id><award-id>J1-6744</award-id><award-id>J3-3082</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (P4-0053, P3-0067, P1-0143, J1-6744, J3-3082).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-animals-12-01217"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Modern anesthetic protocols are based on a multimodal approach to pain prevention that includes the use of various types of analgesics before, during, and after surgery. Perineural administration of local anesthetics (LA) causes efficient and reversible inhibition of excitatory conduction through the nerve and blocks the transmission of pain to the central nervous system. In dogs and cats, the anesthesia-sparing effect of regional anesthesia limits the adverse effects of volatile and injectable anesthetics, prevents hyperalgesia, reduces the consumption of analgesics during the postoperative period, and facilitates faster recovery from anesthesia [<xref rid="B1-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </p><p>Maxillary, infraorbital, major palatinal, inferior alveolar, and mental blocks are used to desensitize the maxilla and mandible in dogs undergoing invasive dental procedures [<xref rid="B5-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Perineural administration of LA into the infraorbital canal in dogs desensitizes the soft and hard tissues from the first incisor to the first molar of the ipsilateral side of the maxilla. Desensitization of the soft and hard tissues of the ipsilateral side of the mandible is achieved by perineural administration of LA into the submucosa at the opening of the mandibular foramen where the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular canal [<xref rid="B3-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The most used LAs in veterinary medicine are lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine [<xref rid="B6-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. After perineural administration of lidocaine into the infraorbital canal, desensitization of the area occurs after 2 to 5 min and lasts for 2 to 3 h, while after administration of bupivacaine desensitization of the area occurs after 5 to 10 min and lasts for 8 to 12 h [<xref rid="B3-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Levobupivacaine (LB), the active l-isomer of bupivacaine, has similar effects to racemic bupivacaine but is less cardiotoxic [<xref rid="B9-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Alpha-2 agonists, including dexmedetomidine (DEX), have been studied as adjuvants to LA to prolong the effect of regional blocks. The combination of LB and DEX was reported to produce 12 to 28 h of sensory block of the brachial plexus in dogs [<xref rid="B10-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Perineural administration of DEX added to ropivacaine for sciatic nerve block prolonged the duration of analgesia [<xref rid="B11-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and caused a dose-dependent increase in the duration of thermal antinociception [<xref rid="B12-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in rats. The onset time was shortened, and the duration of the axillary brachial plexus block and the duration of postoperative analgesia were prolonged when DEX was added to LB in humans [<xref rid="B13-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dexmedetomidine administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 1 &#181;g/kg/h significantly prolonged sensory block after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine and morphine in dogs undergoing various hind leg orthopedic procedures [<xref rid="B14-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is an active d-isomer of the racemic mixture medetomidine. In dogs, its adverse effects are dose-dependent and mainly hemodynamic and include hypertension and bradycardia [<xref rid="B15-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The hemodynamic effects are the result of the activation of pre- and postsynaptic &#945;2-adrenergic receptors, followed by vasoconstriction, sympatholysis, and baroreflex-mediated parasympathetic activation [<xref rid="B16-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of DEX following IV administration in dogs are well known. After a single IV administration 20 &#956;g/kg DEX, the volume of distribution (V<sub>D</sub>) was 0.86 &#177; 0.22 L/kg, the half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was 0.78 &#177; 0.23 h, and the clearance (Cl) was 1.24 &#177; 0.48 L/kg/h. After a single IV application of 10 &#956;g/kg, V<sub>D</sub> was 0.79 &#177; 0.19 L/kg, t<sub>1/2</sub> was 0.66 &#177; 0.18 h, and Cl was 0.97 &#177; 0.33 L/kg/h [<xref rid="B17-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The mean maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) for the IV dose (5 &#956;g/kg), when extrapolated to the time of administration, was 18.6 &#177; 3.3 ng/mL and the time to reach maximal concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 1.5 &#177; 0.6 min. The half-life was 36 &#177; 6 min and the time at which DEX was still detectable in plasma (T<sub>last</sub>) was 110 &#177; 15 min.

The pharmacokinetics of DEX as an adjunctive analgesic drug to regional anesthesia of the oral cavity with LB have not yet been studied. </p><p>The primary aim of this study was to investigate the cardiopulmonary effects of DEX administered perineurally as an adjunctive analgesic to regional anesthesia of the upper and lower jaw with levobupivacaine in anesthetized dogs. The secondary aim of the study was to support the explanation of changes in cardiopulmonary parameters after DEX administration with the results of pharmacokinetic analysis. We hypothesized that infraorbital administration of DEX would result in more rapid and extensive absorption compared with inferior alveolar block due to an increased pressure gradient force across the capillary wall after drug administration in infraorbital canal. Therefore, a greater increase in arterial pressure and more pronounced bradycardia were expected with infraorbital block compared to inferior alveolar block.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-12-01217"><title>2.

Heart rate decreased by 30% after IV administration of DEX and by up to 20% after perineural administration in both infraorbital and inferior alveolar blocks. Based on the difference in heart rate decrease, we determined that at least five dogs per group (DEX IV, DEX infraorbital block, DEX inferior alveolar block, placebo IV) would be required for an alpha of 0.05 and a study power of 0.8. At least 10 dogs per group would be required, for a total of 40 dogs, for a study power of 1.0.

The dose of LB was calculated as in the pilot study. The positive control group (LB + DEX IV) received DEX 0.5 &#181;g/kg IV diluted to 1 mL with Sterile Water for Injection (B Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA), and the negative control group (LB + PLC IV) received IV 1 mL of placebo (Sterile Water for Injection, B Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA). Both positive and negative control groups also received a placebo perineurally together with LB in one of the blocks. The volume (0.2 mL) of perineural placebo in the control groups was equal to the volume of perineural DEX in the test groups. Dexmedetomidine (500 &#181;g/mL) was diluted 1:5 with water for injection to allow accurate dosing. Water for injection was added to the calculated dose of DEX to a final volume of 0.2 mL. The first test group (LB + DEX IO) received DEX 0.5 &#181;g/kg in the left or right infraorbital block and 1 mL placebo IV, while the second test group (LB + DEX IA) received DEX 0.5 &#181;g/kg in the left or right inferior alveolar block and 1 mL placebo IV. The syringe containing the drugs for perineural administration (LB with DEX in the test groups and LB with placebo in the control groups) was always administered as the last block. The stomatologist (A.N.) who administered the blocks and the anesthesiologist (M.P.) who performed the anesthesia and post-procedure evaluations did not know which group each dog was assigned to until the end of the study (double-blind study). For this reason, all injections were always prepared in a different room and by a different anesthesiologist who also participated in the study (A.S.).</p><p>Food was withheld for no more than 12 h before anesthesia and water were allowed ad libitum until the procedure. For drug administration, a 20-gauge catheter (BD Venflon, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Stockholm, Sweden) was aseptically placed in a cephalic vein. The dogs were IV premedicated with methadone 0.2 mg/kg (Comfortan, Dechra, Northwich, UK) and 5 min later induced to anesthesia with propofol (Propoven, Fresenius Kabi, Lake Zurich, IL, USA) titrated until endotracheally intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (Isoflurin, Vetpharma Animal Health, Barcelona, Spain) in oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 1) delivered through a circle breathing system (22 mm Flextube breathing system; Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, UK). The dogs breathed spontaneously during anesthesia. They were placed in dorsal recumbency on a dentistry table covered with soft padding, and forced-air warming (Bair Hugger, 3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) was used when rectal temperature decreased below 37 &#176;C.</p><p>A 22-gauge catheter was aseptically placed in the dorsal pedal artery (BD Venflon, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Stockholm, Sweden) for direct arterial pressure measurement.

The measurements of SAP, DAP, MAP, HR, and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic><sub>R</sub> were recorded three times within 15 s to minimize the possibility of recording errors at each measurement point. The basal values were recorded immediately after the arterial catheter was placed. The oral blocks were performed and then either DEX or placebo was administered IV over two min.

In dogs with a bodyweight of 14.6 &#177; 1.5 kg, the width and height of the infraorbital canal at the narrowest point were 3.1 &#177; 0.2 mm and 3.6 &#177; 0.2 mm, respectively [<xref rid="B19-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The volume of LB used in a 15 kg dog in our study was 0.68 mL. The DEX concentration was 500 &#181;g/mL and had to be diluted for accurate dosing (7.5 &#181;g in a 15 kg dog). The final volume of diluted DEX was 0.2 mL and was mixed with 0.68 mL of LB. Although the pressure within the IO canal was not measured, we presume that the application of drugs into the infraorbital canal increased the pressure within it and resulted in faster absorption in the LB + DEX IO group compared to the LB + DEX IA group. On the other hand, the higher C<sub>max</sub>, better bioavailability (higher AUC<sub>(0</sub><sub>&#8594;120min)</sub>), and faster elimination rate (almost three-times shorter t<sub>1/2</sub>) after IA application might be due to better vascularization and perfusion of the submucosa near the mandibular foramen.</p><p>After perineural administration of DEX, significantly longer t<sub>1/2</sub> and lower AUC<sub>(0</sub><sub>&#8594;120min)</sub> were observed compared to IV application. The process of absorption is a limiting factor in extravascular administration and the terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> reflects the rate and extent of absorption and not the elimination process [<xref rid="B20-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The high SEM of the pooled DEX concentration data determined one min after injection reflects the overlap of the distribution and elimination phases of DEX pharmacokinetics, while at 5 min elimination already predominated and the SEM stabilized. Dexmedetomidine may reduce its own elimination dose-dependently as observed in healthy human volunteers, mainly due to the decrease in cardiac output [<xref rid="B23-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] resulting in decreased hepatic blood flow and slower metabolization rate. A prolonged t<sub>1/2</sub> is expected with higher doses and overdoses or when DEX is co-administered with drugs that affect hepatic circulation [<xref rid="B21-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The dogs in our study were anesthetized with isoflurane which dose-dependently decreases cardiac output [<xref rid="B24-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Dexmedetomidine may counterbalance the effects of isoflurane in terms of vasodilatation and stabilize vascular tone [<xref rid="B25-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

The hemodynamic effects of DEX in dogs are a consequence of the activation of postsynaptic &#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptors in peripheral vascular smooth muscle, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction. The initial increase in blood pressure is associated with increased vagal tone and bradycardia [<xref rid="B31-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Medetomidine, a racemic mixture of the two optical isomers levomedetomidine and dexmedetomidine, produced similar hemodynamic changes at doses of 1 to 20 &#181;g/kg IV, although the changes were less evident at the lowest doses (1 to 2 &#181;g/kg) [<xref rid="B32-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The difference, although non-significant, in MAP and HR in the LB + DEX IV and LB + DEX IA groups compared to the LB + DEX IO group was due to a higher plasma concentration of DEX (more than 10-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> after IV administration and more than 7-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> after IA administration). The better bioavailability of DEX after IA administration may be attributed to greater absorption of DEX after application of the drug into the well-perfused submucosa in the vicinity of the mandibular foramen. The highest MAP and lowest HR and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic><sub>R</sub> in the LB + DEX IO group were observed earlier than in the LB + DEX IA group, consistent with the shorter, although not significant, T<sub>max</sub> in the LB + DEX IO group. We presume that this may be due to an increased pressure gradient force across the capillary wall immediately after drug administration into the infraorbital canal. The early oscillations in cardiopulmonary parameters after application of oral blocks in all dogs were attributed to nociceptive stimulation due to the dental procedure and the time to onset of sensory blockade with LB (usually less than 15 min if applied close to the nerve) [<xref rid="B33-animals-12-01217" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The present study has some limitations which need to be addressed. First, because this was a clinical study, the dogs underwent different dentistry procedures. Although blood samples were taken up to 120 min after IV application, the statistical analysis of cardiopulmonary parameters (HR, MAP, <italic toggle="yes">f</italic><sub>R</sub>) and the comparison between groups was performed only up to 30 min after IV application of DEX or placebo. According to the calculation of the power of the study, at least five dogs per group were required for &#945; = 0.05 and a study power of at least 0.8. This requirement was met only up to 30 min after IV application because in some dogs the procedure was terminated within 30 min. It would not be ethical to prolong anesthesia only because of the requirements of this research. Second, although all blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis from each dog, in some of them the procedure was completed before the last sampling. In this case, the remaining blood samples were collected from non-anesthetized dogs and this might affect the pharmacokinetics of DEX. Last, because of the repeated blood sampling (the total volume of blood withdrawn from each dog was 60 mL), no dogs weighing less than 10 kg were included in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-animals-12-01217"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The hypothesis that the administration of DEX into the infraorbital canal would result in faster and more extensive absorption leading to a greater increase of MAP and more pronounced bradycardia compared to IA administration was not confirmed. Although IO administration resulted in faster absorption of DEX, the bioavailability was better and elimination faster at IA administration. No difference in MAP and HR was observed between the LB + DEX IO and LB + DEX IA groups; however, MAP was higher in the LB + DEX IV group when compared to perineural administration. Perineural administration of DEX was associated with lower plasma concentration compared to IV administration and may be preferable because it induces a less pronounced cardiovascular response in terms of bradycardia and hypertension. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-animals-12-01217"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following is available online at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ani12091217/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ani12091217/s1</uri>, Table S1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</p><supplementary-material id="animals-12-01217-s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="animals-12-01217-s001.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, M.P., M.K., A.N. and A.S.; Formal analysis, M.K. and A.B.; Investigation, M.P., A.N. and T.K.; Supervision, A.S.; Writing&#8211;original draft, M.P., M.K., T.K. and A.B.; Writing&#8211;review &amp; editing, M.K. and A.S.
