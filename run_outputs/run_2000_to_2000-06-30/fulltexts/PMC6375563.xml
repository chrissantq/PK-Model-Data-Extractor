It is, therefore, essential that we understand the optimal environment and diet for a child&#8217;s first months. Recent reviews affirm that breastfeeding confers numerous benefits to infants in comparison with formula feeding (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">AAP 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Hennet and Borsig 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Ip et&#160;al. 2007</xref>) and that exclusively breastfeeding infants for their first 6 mo, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">AAP 2012</xref>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref rid="c132" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2011</xref>), provides additional benefits over exclusively breastfeeding for only the first 3 or 4 mo (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">AAP 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Kramer and Kakuma 2012</xref>). Strong evidence supports the association between breastfeeding and reduced childhood risks for acute otitis media, severe lower respiratory infections, nonspecific gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), neurodevelopmental problems, and childhood leukemia, as well as necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">AAP 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Ip et&#160;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c124" ref-type="bibr">Victora et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). Breastfeeding is also associated with maternal health benefits, including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and breast and ovarian cancers (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">AAP 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Ip et&#160;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c124" ref-type="bibr">Victora et&#160;al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, breast milk and infant formula contain environmental chemicals to which infants are exposed (<xref rid="c145" ref-type="bibr">Baier-Anderson et&#160;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c144" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Slorach 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et&#160;al. 2018</xref>). Epidemiological research has focused on exploring whether infant exposure to these environmental chemicals is associated with various health outcomes. The earliest epidemiological studies on environmental chemicals in breast milk were published in the late 1980s (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Gladen et&#160;al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="c103" ref-type="bibr">Rogan et&#160;al. 1987</xref>), and the literature has expanded since that time. In contrast, environmental chemicals in infant formula&#8212;reconstituted with drinking water or ready to use&#8212;and associated health outcomes in infants and children have not garnered the same attention.</p><p>Several reviews of epidemiological research on environmental chemicals in breast milk and potential adverse health effects in infants and children have been published (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Jorissen 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Kacew 1994</xref>; <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Landrigan et&#160;al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Massart et&#160;al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c98" ref-type="bibr">Pohl and Hibbs 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Ribas-Fit&#243; et&#160;al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c105" ref-type="bibr">Schreiber 2001</xref>). Most examined one or a few classes of chemicals rather than attempting to examine all of the extant literature on environmental chemicals, and none included a formal examination of study quality in their assessments. For example, Goldman et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) evaluated the benefits and risks to the breastfeeding infant from a variety of potential risk factors, such as micronutrient deficiency, proinflammatory fatty acids, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pharmaceuticals, and environmental chemicals. Although some of these factors were associated with adverse clinical outcomes in infants, for environmental chemical exposures, the authors concluded that risks associated with breastfeeding were &#8220;largely undetermined.&#8221; In a risk&#8211;benefit assessment, van den Berg et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c122" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) found that dioxin-like chemicals in breast milk were above levels considered safe and that <inline-formula><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#931;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>DDTs</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) are below or around safe levels but concluded that if &#8220;&#8230;potential adverse effects are balanced against positive health aspects for (breastfed) infants, the advantages of breastfeeding far outweigh the possible disadvantages.&#8221;</p><p>LaKind et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) reviewed the literature on environmental chemicals in human milk, including concentrations, infant exposures, epidemiological (six mother&#8211;infant cohort epidemiological studies) and risk assessment studies, and guidance for future research. For an in-depth case examination of the epidemiological literature on dioxins in breast milk, LaKind et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used risk assessment methods as well as a review of the epidemiological evidence. Although some of the epidemiological studies found effects in breastfed infants exposed to dioxin-like compounds in breast milk, LaKind et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) noted that effects were generally within the range of normal and exposures in these study cohorts were higher than are typically found today. The authors also reported that, in most studies, it was not possible to separate the effects of prenatal and postnatal exposures (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2008</xref>). They observed that &#8220;The essential conclusion&#8230;is that in studies of breastfed versus formula-fed infants across time, including times when levels of environmental chemicals such as dioxins were higher, beneficial effects associated with breastfeeding have been found.&#8221; Jorissen (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) published an evaluation of epidemiological studies on postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) via breast milk and similarly concluded that although breastfed infants experienced higher exposures to PCBs in comparison with formula-fed infants, they &#8220;fared&#8221; better than formula-fed infants. Similarly, Aliyu et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) recommended breastfeeding despite the presence of PCBs in breast milk. Although these published reviews offer assessments of different aspects of the literature on infant exposures to environmental chemicals via diet (principally from breastfeeding) and associated health outcomes, none included a formal method for assessing the quality of the literature nor a strength-of-evidence assessment.</p><p>To our knowledge, a critical examination of information on&#8212;and approaches to&#8212;understanding associations between infant exposures to environmental chemicals in breast milk or infant formulas, including data strengths and weaknesses, has not been undertaken.</p><p>In this paper, we examine epidemiological literature and use a strength-of-evidence approach to address the following question: Are infant exposures to background levels of environmental chemicals in breast milk and formula associated with adverse health effects?</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Using a Population, Exposure, Comparison, and Outcomes (PECO) framework (<xref rid="c146" ref-type="bibr">Higgins and Green 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c143" ref-type="bibr">Lam et&#160;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c142" ref-type="bibr">Stephens et&#160;al. 2016</xref>), we define the boundaries of the review as follows:</p><p><bold>Population:</bold> Infants and children (up to 18 y of age).</p><p><bold>Exposure:</bold> Exposure to environmental chemicals via breastfeeding or consumption of infant formula as assessed using at least one measurement of levels of chemical(s) in breast milk or formula.

For the purposes of this review, we restrict the definition of environmental chemicals to those found in the environment with exposure sources, including air, soil, water, personal care products, food and drinks, clothes, or furniture.

These current-day levels of breast milk chlordecone measured in Guadeloupe are similar to levels reported in the only study we could find of chlordecone in breast milk from women in the United States. That report was published in 1978, and chlordecone was detected in 9 of 298 samples at levels ranging from <inline-formula><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#8211;</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mtext>&#8201; ppb</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref rid="c119" ref-type="bibr">U.S. EPA 1978</xref>). Chlordecone use in the U.S. was never as extensive as in Guadeloupe, and U.S. production of chlordecone ended in 1975 (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">ATSDR 1995</xref>). Because of differences in the patterns of use of this pesticide, it is unlikely that the general population of the U.S. currently has breast milk levels of chlordecone comparable to those reported in the studies of Guadeloupe; we did not include these studies in our evidence summaries.</p><p>During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military applied herbicide mixtures, including Agent Orange, to eliminate foliage that could conceal enemy forces, to clear areas around military installations, and to disrupt agricultural food production (<xref rid="c107" ref-type="bibr">Stellman et&#160;al. 2003</xref>). Agent Orange was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD); as a result, exposures in the areas that were sprayed consist predominantly of this most toxic dioxin congener. High levels of usage and spills not mirrored in the United States coupled with differences in congener patterns (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Banout et&#160;al. 2014</xref>) make it unlikely that one would observe exposure patterns in the United States similar to those in hotspots in Vietnam.

Three groups of mother/infant pairs were included in these studies&#8212;two in rural villages of either fishermen or cassiterite miners and one in an urban center. In general, due to vaccinations, proximity to smelters and kilns, and subsistence fishing, this cohort is likely exposed to higher concentrations of heavy metals than would be found in the general U.S. population, and their overall life experience is quite different from the U.S. population. Therefore, this cohort was excluded from our evidence summaries.</p><p>Sixty-six publications were ultimately included in the evidence summaries.

In general, these were prospective cohort studies with recruitment from hospitals or birthing centers. Both exposure levels and outcomes were determined after entry into the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3.1.2"><title>Was knowledge of the exposure groups adequately prevented during the study?</title><p>For studies included in this review, assessment of subjective outcomes most often included the use of neurodevelopmental assessment batteries or pubertal developmental staging; objective outcomes included measures of hormone levels or immunological factors in blood, or anthropometric measures, such as height and weight. Most studies either implemented adequate blinding or included only objective outcome measures unlikely to be influenced by knowledge of exposure level or group (Table S2). A judgment of inadequate blinding was generally made if blinding was not mentioned in the study and the outcome assessment was more subjective in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s3.1.3"><title>Were the methods for assessing lactational exposures robust?</title><p>Strong, exemplary breast milk exposure assessment methods were used in a number of studies. Researchers conducting a birth cohort study in North Carolina (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Gladen et&#160;al. 1988</xref>) sampled breast milk four times by 6 mo postpartum and every 6 or 12 mo thereafter for as long as the mother was breastfeeding. This cohort, which informed numerous publications, stands out as nearly unique for the number of samples collected over time. In the D&#252;sseldorf cohort, two samples were taken at 2 and 4 wk postpartum (<xref rid="c135" ref-type="bibr">Winneke et&#160;al. 1998</xref>), and the results of the chemical analyses of each individual sample were averaged together to provide the chemical concentration for the exposure estimation. In the Groningen/Rotterdam study, up to three milk samples per mother were collected until 3 mo postpartum (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Huisman et&#160;al. 1995a</xref>); however, in publications reporting on the cohort, the researchers mention only one of the samples in connection with their analyses (at 2 wk postpartum). The cohort study conducted in Amsterdam and Zaandam, the Netherlands, pooled two samples from the same time period, at 3 wk postpartum. No other study included in our review reported collecting or using multiple breast milk samples in their analyses of postnatal exposures.</p><p>The Netherlands cohort (<xref rid="c96" ref-type="bibr">Pluim et&#160;al. 1994</xref>) provides a good example of estimating total exposures by including both volume of milk consumed and time of exclusive breastfeeding in their exposure assessment along with the concentrations of chemicals of interest at 3 wk postpartum. Not only did the North Carolina cohort mentioned above collect multiple milk samples, but researchers also calculated exposures using the amount of milk consumed and length of time breastfeeding, completing what was one of the most comprehensive and complete postnatal exposure assessments in this database. Many studies included duration of breastfeeding in their exposure calculations, but some dichotomized duration data in their analyses (i.e., expressed duration as &#8220;<inline-formula><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mo>&#8804;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> some number of weeks or months&#8221; or &#8220;<inline-formula><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> some number of weeks or months&#8221;), which poses increased risk of misclassification bias (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). Others did not include any duration factor in their exposure estimations, relying solely on one chemical concentration in breast milk and not considering extent and duration of breastfeeding. Far fewer studies collected information about exclusivity of breastfeeding or appropriately adjusted volume of milk consumed in their exposure estimation or included this information in their statistical analyses for associations with the health outcome of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s3.1.4"><title>Was confounding from prenatal and postweaning exposures adequately addressed?</title><p>Any epidemiology study will have a multitude of confounders to consider, and we recognize that it may not be possible to account for every conceivable confounder. For the purposes of this review, we focus on two aspects of confounding that we view as critically important for assessing relationships between health outcomes and exposure to environmental chemicals in breast milk: consideration of <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures and consideration of child dietary exposures outside of breastfeeding.</p><p>Only two studies reviewed in this paper included estimates of prenatal exposures in their analysis of associations between infant exposure to chemicals in breast milk and health outcomes. Huisman et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">1995a</xref>) measured chemicals in cord blood and used these data to adjust analyses of associations between health outcomes (2&#8211;3 wk postpartum) and chemical concentrations in milk. The study by Walkowiak et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) included a chemical exposure assessment method that could potentially control for prenatal and postweaning exposures. The researchers measured PCBs in cord and children&#8217;s blood at 42 mo (the time of outcome assessment) and then used child blood levels at 42 mo in an effects model controlled for prenatal exposure. They did not note whether they created a model with prenatal, breast milk, and postweaning dietary exposures, though measurements of PCBs at the various time points would make such an analysis possible.</p><p>Aside from those two studies, others in this review separately analyzed the associations of a measure of prenatal exposure and postnatal breast milk exposure with the outcome of interest. Although not as robust as controlling for one exposure in the statistical model, this analysis provides an estimation of the relative strength of associations between the two routes of exposure and various developmental windows.</p><p>In terms of child dietary exposures, for many of the chemicals examined in the literature (e.g., dioxins and furans, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides), diet is a substantial pathway of exposure. For studies evaluating outcomes in infants or very young children who are still predominantly breastfed, exposures from other foods may not be an important issue. However, for many of the cohorts included in this review, children were followed for many years, well past the time of weaning. In these cases, dietary exposures outside of breast milk will likely play important roles, both in terms of exposure and outcome, and are thus confounding elements in these studies.</p><p>Only one study reviewed here (<xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">Walkowiak et&#160;al. 2001</xref>) analyzed associations between health outcomes (mental and motor development) and blood chemical (PCB) levels at the time of outcome assessment (42 mo of age) while also controlling for prenatal exposure levels. The researchers also analyzed associations of breast milk PCB levels with the same outcomes and compared the strengths of association. That said, their data indicated a fivefold higher blood PCB level at 42 mo old in children breastfed for more than 4 mo in comparison with those children breastfed for less than 2 wk, which might indicate that the confounding effect of postweaning exposures is relatively minor at 42 mo of age. Other cohort studies that assessed outcomes at 8, 10, or 13 y of age (Table S1) did not report on chemical levels at the time of assessment. Most studies did not attempt to factor in postweaning exposures, even though more than a decade might have elapsed between weaning and outcome assessment. Years of dietary and environmental media exposures to the same chemicals found in breast milk would contribute to overall lifetime exposures to those chemicals, and, for many health outcomes studied, the sensitive window of development is not known, such that exposures during later life stages may be as important as exposures during infancy.</p></sec><sec id="s3.1.5"><title>Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</title><p>Many of the studies we reviewed compared demographic characteristics or exposure levels for participants whose outcomes were assessed with those for the original cohort.

The authors obtained data on other outcomes, including coughing spells, dyspnoea, asthma, pneumonia, chickenpox, measles, and atopy, reporting the results for several of these outcomes in a later publication (<xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">ten Tusscher et&#160;al. 2003</xref>). Lactational exposures to PCDDs/PCDFs were significantly negatively associated with allergies for both exposure metrics; findings were null for otitis media, pneumonia, and chicken pox. In the Rotterdam/Groningen cohort from preschool age to school age, Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c131" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found no association between PCDDs/PCDFs/PCBs in breast milk and chicken pox, allergic reaction, or shortness of breath/wheeze. There were significant positive associations with middle ear infection for PCBs (expressed as the sum of four PCB congeners in breast milk multiplied by the breastfeeding duration) and also for children breastfed less than 4 mo in comparison with children breastfed for more than 4 mo. As in ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), no association was found between ear infections and TEQs in breast milk. Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c131" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) also observed no significant difference in shortness of breath with wheeze between children breastfed less than 6 wk and greater than 4 mo. Children who had been breastfed for less than 4 mo had a higher risk of ear infection and less shortness of breath in comparison with those breastfed for greater than 4 mo.</p><p>It is difficult to interpret the results for the children of school age, because no information on various factors that influence morbidity in the years between weaning and outcome assessment was provided, and it is not clear if this information was obtained. There was only one study on lung function (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">ten Tusscher et&#160;al. 2001</xref>), so assessing overall strength of evidence across studies is not possible. The lung function study (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">ten Tusscher et&#160;al. 2001</xref>) and one other study (<xref rid="c129" ref-type="bibr">Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al. 2000</xref>) found statistically significant positive associations between TEQs in breast milk and chest congestion in children 7&#8211;12 y old and 42 mo of age, respectively (although the latter study combined coughing, chest congestion, and phlegm). Results for allergy and ear infections were different across studies. Again, for ear infections, there were differences in the chemicals analyzed. Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c131" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found a positive association between middle-ear infection and lactational exposure to PCBs expressed as the sum of four congeners (PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180). However, neither this study nor ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) observed such an association when exposure was expressed as total TEQs. For allergy, ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) reported a negative association with lactational exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs expressed as total TEQ whereas Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c131" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found no association between total TEQ in breast milk and allergic reaction. These studies defined allergies and assessed their prevalence using similar methods. Even so, many factors could influence study results, including difference in exposures and exposure assessments, breastfeeding duration, and parental medical histories.</p></sec><sec id="s3.2.9.3"><title>Assessment of study quality and risk of bias.</title><p>The highest quality studies for this outcome category include Dewailly et&#160;al.

The ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) study reported significant associations between the TEQs in breast milk and chest congestion in children at 7&#8211;12 y old, a finding that mirrors the findings that Weisglas-Kuperus et&#160;al.

The children in these two studies were 31 mo of age and 7&#8211;12 y of age, respectively, and thus experienced a longer postweaning duration in comparison with the other cohorts, which all comprised children around 1 y of age or younger.</p><p>Pluim et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) reported that for the group exposed to higher dioxin-TEQ levels in breast milk, there was a significant positive association with plasma TT4 and TT4/TBG at both 1 and 11 wk of age and with TSH at 11 wk.

(<xref rid="c80" ref-type="bibr">2001b</xref>), but the result became null when data were analyzed from a larger group of infants (sample sizes increased from 55 in the breastfed group and 30 in the formula-fed group to 337 and 53, respectively) (<xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr">Matsuura et&#160;al. 2001a</xref>). Nagayama et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>) observed a significant negative association between total dioxin-PCB TEQ in breast milk and TT4 and TT3 in infants at 1 y of age but found no association with TBG or TSH.</p><p>Although it is difficult to draw strength-of-association conclusions across these studies due to differences in study design, several of the study authors who reported significant findings placed their results in a child health context. For example, Pluim et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) stated that &#8220;the change in circulating TT4 and TSH concentration does not prove that functional thyroid status has been affected by pre- and postnatal exposure to dioxins.&#8221; Koopman-Esseboom et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) found that the thyroid hormone levels were in the normal range, but cautioned that the &#8220;small changes observed in this study might be of influence on the development of the fetus and infant.&#8221; Nagayama et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>) did not provide health context for the thyroid hormone levels in their study, but LaKind et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) stated that the TSH levels generally fell within&#8212;and TT4 and TT3 levels were within or slightly higher than&#8212;published reference ranges.</p><p>One study examined the relationship between perchlorate and thiocyanate in breast milk and thyroid hormone levels in infants. Leung et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) conducted a cross-sectional study in 64 Boston-area mothers and their 1&#8211;3 mo-old infants. They found no correlations between infant TSH or FT4 and breast milk levels of perchlorate and thiocyanate. With only one study available for these chemicals, it is not possible to explore strength of association.</p><p>The studies with the highest rankings were Ilsen et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c113" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and Pluim et&#160;al.

None of the highest quality studies for this outcome category included exposure to PCBs in their analysis. Pluim et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) was the only one of these highest quality studies to evaluate thyroid hormone levels in young infants and the only one to observe an association between thyroid hormone levels and lactational exposure. The direction of this association was opposite that observed in some other studies of young infants (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Koopman-Esseboom et&#160;al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">Nagayama et&#160;al. 1998a</xref>), and it is possible that the difference in results may be explained by differences in study quality or by differences in the chemicals included in the analyses (dioxin TEQs vs. total dioxin/PCB TEQs). The other two highest quality studies found no associations in older children when considering dioxin TEQs (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Ilsen et&#160;al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c113" ref-type="bibr">ten Tusscher et&#160;al. 2008</xref>).

(<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) found significant positive associations between mono-ethyl phthalate (mEP) and mono-<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-butyl phthalate (mBP) in breast milk and serum levels of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in 3-mo-old boys. Positive associations were also observed between the serum luteinizing hormone (LH):free testosterone ratio and mono-methyl phthalate (mMP), mEP, and mBP and between serum LH and mono-isononyl phthalate (miNP). Significant inverse associations were reported between mBP and free testosterone and between mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (mEHP) and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):inhibin B ratio. No associations were observed between any of the measured phthalates, including mono-benzyl phthalate (mBzP), and serum levels of testosterone, FSH, inhibin B, or the LH:testosterone ratio.</p><p>Rennert et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) observed no associations between lactational exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs/PCBs and testosterone, estradiol or 17-OH-progesterone in older children from the Duisburg cohort (6&#8211;7- and 8&#8211;9-y-old children). However, a positive association with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) was observed.</p><p>Tang-Peronard et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c110" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported an association between HCB in breast milk and increased levels of serum insulin (girls only), but not leptin in the Faroese Birth Cohort. They did not find mediating effects of insulin or leptin on later obesity.</p><p>Wohlfahrt-Veje et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c138" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) examined associations between serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) and lactational exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs/PCBs (expressed as TEQs), nondioxin-like PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), PBDEs, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in 3-mo-old infants. Results were reported only for total TEQs, for which a significant positive association was found. Although as described above, Wohlfahrt-Veje et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c138" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also found a significant positive association between dioxins in breast milk on height (from 0&#8211;36 mo of age) and weight gain (from 0&#8211;18 mo of age), other studies have observed negative or no associations between breast milk dioxins and growth in children of similar ages (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Ilsen et&#160;al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#160;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr">Patandin et&#160;al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c97" ref-type="bibr">Pluim et&#160;al. 1996</xref>).

In particular, several potential deficits related to exposure assessment were noted. The publications by Rennert et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Wohlfahrt-Veje et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c138" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) had only two categories with lower quality ratings and both ranked lower for the criterion of confounding. In addition, lower rankings were assigned to the study by Rennert et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) for incomplete outcome data and to the study by Wohlfahrt-Veje et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c138" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) for incomplete exposure characterization. Because these three studies each looked at different chemical exposures or different outcomes, no strength-of-evidence conclusions were drawn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3.2.11"><title>Infant/child neurodevelopment.</title><p>Neurodevelopment is the most frequently studied outcome category in this body of literature. For the purposes of examining strength of association across studies, the research is divided into two groups. First, we describe research that used parent questionnaires for child behavior, language, and/or developmental milestones [e.g., tests such as the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MacArthur CDI), Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Pre-School Activities Inventory (PSAI), Child Behavior Checklist/Teacher&#8217;s Report Form (CBCL/TRF)]. We then describe the literature that used standardized researcher-administered tests in two categories. The first includes studies that used researcher assessments of motor development for children under approximately 6 mo of age [e.g., tests such as Prechtl/Neurological Optimality Score (NOS), Hempel, Psychomotor Development Index/Bayley Scales of Infant Development (PDI/BSID), the motor portion of the McCarthy Scales of Children&#8217;s Abilities (MSCA)]. The second used standardized researcher-administered assessments of broader neurodevelopment beyond the first 6 mo, including IQ (i.e., intelligence quotient), motor function, memory, reaction time, and/or language [e.g., tests such as BSID, Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), MSCA, Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (Fagan), Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (Kaufman), Test of Attentional Performance for Children (KiTAP), Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R), Reynell Developmental Language Scales (Reynell)] [one study that is not replicated in the literature is not discussed further; visual function&#8212;Riva et&#160;al.

This association was stronger among less-educated mothers and was no longer present at 24 mo of age, regardless of maternal education.</p><p>Two studies with different cohorts assessed neurodevelopment in children from 12&#8211;24 mo of age and reported mostly null results. The study by Pan et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) was relatively strong, receiving a lower ranking for the category of missing outcome data (Table S2). Forns et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) was ranked lower for blinding, confounding, and incomplete outcome data. Although both of these studies assessed DDT and DDE and used questionnaires completed by parents to evaluate behavioral parameters in 12-mo-old children, the specific behavioral parameters assessed in these studies were different. The MacArthur CDI, used by Pan et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), provides a measure of a child&#8217;s vocabulary, while the ITSC, used by Forns et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), assesses a wider variety of behavioral aspects, including those related to self-regulation and temperament. The only association reported between breast milk organochlorine pesticide levels and parent-assessed development was between DDT and ITSC scores at 12 mo of age, and this association was transient, disappearing by 24 mo (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Forns et&#160;al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>Pan et&#160;al.

The Duisberg cohort children were assessed with the PSAI at 6&#8211;8 y of age and Winneke et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c137" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) observed a statistically significant association between lactational TEQ&#8722;weighted sum of <inline-formula><mml:math id="m59"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PCDD</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>PCB</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> exposures and reported femininity [positive for boys and negative for girls; there were also statistically significant results for masculinity (negative for girls for PCDDs/PCDFs and PCDDs/PCDFs/PCBs)]. The children in the Rotterdam cohort were assessed at 7.5 y of age using the PSAI to determine whether exposures to PCDDs/PCDFs/PCBs were associated with sex-related differences in childhood play behavior (<xref rid="c126" ref-type="bibr">Vreugdenhil et&#160;al. 2002b</xref>). <inline-formula><mml:math id="m60"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#8721;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>PCBs</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in milk were associated with more masculine play behavior in girls, whereas dioxin TEQ levels in milk were associated with more feminized play behavior in both sexes; lactational exposures assessed as chemical concentrations in breast milk multiplied by the number of weeks of breastfeeding were not associated with play behavior in children who had been breastfed or in boys and girls separately. The Amsterdam-Zaandam cohort was assessed with the CBCL and TRF at ages 7&#8211;12 y (<xref rid="c114" ref-type="bibr">ten Tusscher et&#160;al. 2014</xref>). The authors reported that the TRF showed a statistically significant increase in social problems, aggressive behavior and thought problems&#8212;as well as an increase in total TRF and total externalizing scores&#8212;associated with cumulative lactational PCDD/PCDF exposures. The CBCL showed a statistically significant increase in social problems with increasing cumulative lactational PCDD/PCDF exposures. A borderline positive significant association was seen with increasing aggressive behavior. Parents reported increased anxious/depressed feelings and social problems with increased TEQ in breast milk. Kono et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) used the Social Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to evaluate associations between lactational exposure to dioxins and social and behavioral problems in children between the ages of 6 and 13 y. They found no significant association between the SDQ &#8220;total difficulties score&#8221; and estimated dioxin exposure through breastfeeding in boys or girls, or in children aged 6&#8211;10 y or 11&#8211;13 y. The Duisberg cohort was studied at 8&#8211;11 y of age using a parent rating scale for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (FBB-ADHS) (<xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr">Neugebauer et&#160;al. 2015</xref>); a reduced FBB-ADHS impulsivity score was observed for <inline-formula><mml:math id="m61"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#8721;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>PCBs</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> exposure through breastfeeding but not for TEQ-weighted PCBs or PCDDs/PCDFs.</p><p>These studies of different cohorts yielded mixed results for influence on feminine/masculine behavior and on outcomes such as social problems. The only similar finding was for increased reported femininity behavior in older boys with increasing exposure to TEQs as discussed earlier. However, direct comparisons of the results of the studies of social problems are problematic because of differences in the testing instruments used. In addition, it is difficult to draw conclusions about associations between breastfeeding and effects in older children without examining multiple possible confounders for the intervening years. Nonreplication of outcomes for other findings make strength-of-evidence assessments difficult. Pan et&#160;al.

Despite similarities in recruitment year and in country (western, developed countries), it is difficult to draw any robust conclusions regarding the evidence of an association between lactational exposures and early life motor development due to differences in study design and results.</p></sec><sec id="s3.2.11.3"><title>Standardized researcher-administered assessments (neurodevelopment in children approximately 7 months of age and older).</title><p>Many studies have used researcher-administered function tests of development in children to examine potential effects of lactational exposure to PBDEs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs, and/or DDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">13</xref>).

Although exposure levels cannot be directly compared across cohorts (e.g., different methods of PCB analysis were used for each cohort, measuring different sets of congeners for each), it is of interest to note that breast milk PCB levels in two studies that recruited women in the early 1990s, and reported significant findings, were <inline-formula><mml:math id="m73"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>835.9</mml:mn><mml:mtext>&#8201; ng</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">mL</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> lipid (mean) and <inline-formula><mml:math id="m74"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>162.4</mml:mn><mml:mtext>&#8201; ng</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> lipid (median) for Jacobson et&#160;al.

In the D&#252;sseldorf cohort, at 7 mo of age, after adjustment for mother&#8217;s BMI, age, education, vocabulary, and breastfeeding duration as well as infant birth weight, HOME score, Apgar score, and cord blood lead levels, a significant negative association was observed between lactational exposure to PCBs 138, 153, and 180 and the mental development index (MDI) part of the BSID-II; no associations with motor development were observed (<xref rid="c135" ref-type="bibr">Winneke et&#160;al. 1998</xref>). Walkowiak et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) reanalyzed the data from infants at 7 mo of age together with data gathered when the children reached 18, 30, and 42 mo of age, adjusting for variables known to impact mental or motor development (i.e., parental education, maternal IQ, infant sex, and HOME score) as well as variables found in their analysis to correlate with both exposure and outcome (i.e., parity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and maternal BMI). They reported negative associations for both mental and motor scores that were statistically significant at 30 mo of age and older (using the BSID at 18 and 30 mo and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children at 42 mo). At 72 mo of age, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children scores were no longer associated with lactational exposure to these PCBs (<xref rid="c136" ref-type="bibr">Winneke et&#160;al. 2005</xref>); the authors postulate that &#8220;early PCB-exposure at current environmental background levels possibly induces transient delay in cognitive development rather than irreversible deficit.&#8221; Further evidence for a potential reduction in impact associated with lower exposure levels comes from the Duisberg cohort, with no reported associations between BSID-II scores in 12- to 24-mo-olds and lactational exposures to either PCDD/PCDF/PCB-TEQ (<xref rid="c134" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et&#160;al. 2008b</xref>) or the sum of PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 (<xref rid="c133" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et&#160;al. 2008a</xref>).

First, environmental chemicals in breast milk are also present in the mother during gestation, a particularly vulnerable life stage for many health end points. Thus, depending on study design, it is either difficult or impossible to disentangle the two exposure periods when ascribing any effects observed in children to environmental chemical exposure; studies that compare breastfed infants across different dose groups as well as formula-fed infants and include a measure of chemical levels in each pregnant mother offer an opportunity to separate possible effects from exposures during these two life stages. Second, we can only attempt to evaluate potential links between exposure and outcome for those chemicals actually measured, as most studies limit their focus to one or a few chemicals. Third, breastfeeding in and of itself confers many health benefits to infants, requiring an assessment of decreased optimality rather than simply examining risk alone. This type of complexity mirrors that of assessing risk/benefits associated with fish consumption; i.e., how to assess the benefits associated with consuming omega-3 fatty acids vs. the risks associated with environmental chemicals in fish. Finally, there are numerous end points related to growth and development that could be examined; however, due to resource-, time- and burden-related limitations, most studies can only focus on at most one or a few outcomes. Therefore, although there is a body of literature related to health outcomes and environmental chemicals in breast milk, all studies suffer from at least some of the limitations described here. Despite this, there is information to be gleaned from the literature as well as lessons learned that can inform future research.</p><p>In this examination of the environmental epidemiology literature on associations between environmental chemicals in breast milk and infant/child outcomes, we sought to identify aspects of the literature that, taken together, would inform public health discussions about this critical life stage. Although a relatively large number of cohorts have been studied, and many studies reported no associations between exposure and outcome, the number of chemicals that have been addressed by the body of research is relatively small. The only studies with similar study design yielding concordant results were two studies that reported inverse associations with cognitive outcome and BDE-209, although the exposure assessments were not conducted in the same way (i.e., colostrum vs. milk samples collected one mo postpartum). Two studies reported statistically significant positive associations between chest congestion and TEQs in breast milk, though in children of different ages and using different questions to ascertain that health outcome. Similarly, two other studies reported negative associations in children of different ages with different neurodevelopmental function tests and higher PCB levels.</p><p>Results varied for studies that evaluated effects of chemicals in breast milk on growth in infants and young children. Some differences may stem from variations in study design (e.g., chemicals measured, age of children at the time of outcome assessment, types of anthropometric measurements taken). For studies that compared growth in breastfed infants with those not breastfed [e.g., Grandjean et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>)], it must be recognized that these efforts are complicated by the differences observed for growth curves between breastfed and formula-fed infants (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">CDC 2015</xref>). For example, at 18 mo of age, breastfed babies in a cohort in Davis, California, were shown to weigh less than formula-fed babies (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Dewey et&#160;al. 1992</xref>). The difference in weights of breastfed babies and those not breastfed in the Faroe Islands (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Grandjean et&#160;al. 2003</xref>) and in Davis, California was almost identical; assuming that infants in Davis had lower PCB exposures than the Faroese children because of the Faroese consumption of fish and marine mammals with high levels of environmental chemicals (<xref rid="c128" ref-type="bibr">Weihe and Joensen 2012</xref>), this would reinforce the hypothesis that other nutritional factors drive the difference in weight gain for the two different forms of infant nutrition. Further, <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures to PCBs may be associated with delayed infant growth. Grandjean et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) point out the challenge of disentangling the highly correlated pre- and postnatal exposures.</p><p>Similar to the results for studies of effects on growth in infants and young children, statistically significant findings were not replicated across studies with similar exposure&#8211;outcome hypotheses for health outcomes, such as otitis media, and allergic and infectious diseases (for ages ranging from infancy to school-age children; the strongest studies provided contrasting findings), or thyroid hormone levels in infants and children. Although small changes in immune function biomarkers were observed in more than one study, there was little consistent evidence supporting an increased risk of infectious disease or other alteration in immune function in infants. For neurodevelopmental outcomes, the literature once again offers mixed results in terms of outcome and study quality, with limited replication of study design. Although these issues are particularly evident for the literature on PBDEs, these chemicals have been studied more recently in comparison with the organochlorine chemicals. Additional studies will be useful to determine whether the reported significant outcomes&#8212;some of which were variously described by the study authors as &#8220;small,&#8221; &#8220;imprecise,&#8221; or &#8220;modest&#8221;&#8212;are consistently observed.</p><p>To interpret the information in this review, several issues must be addressed. First, we limited our assessment to cohorts with background levels of exposure similar to those encountered by the general population of the United States. For the studies included in our evaluation, it is uncertain whether the convenience sampling conducted covered the entire range of possible background exposures&#8212;particularly those experiencing the highest levels of background exposure&#8212;during the studies&#8217; respective time periods. Some of the cohorts may have included individuals in the general population that may have been more highly exposed based on their consumption of game fish [e.g., cohorts of anglers in Michigan (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et&#160;al. 1990</xref>) and New York (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#160;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et&#160;al. 2012</xref>)], or Arctic marine mammals [e.g., a population from Arctic Quebec, the Inuit Cohort (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Dewailly et&#160;al. 2000</xref>)]. Longnecker et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) compared the PCB exposures of mothers (as characterized by their milk and serum levels) from 10 different cohort studies evaluating neurodevelopmental impacts. Their analysis highlighted similarities as well as differences seen across the cohorts: &#8220;a) the distribution of exposure in the majority of studies overlapped substantially, b) exposure levels in the Faroe Islands study was about 3 to 4 times higher than in most other studies, and c) the exposure levels in the more recent United States studies were one-third or more lower than in the earlier United States studies or more recent European and northern Qu&#233;bec studies.&#8221; Our current review included two of the studies (<xref rid="c93" ref-type="bibr">Patandin et&#160;al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">Walkowiak et&#160;al. 2001</xref>) and half of the cohorts assessed by Longnecker et&#160;al.

(<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) found no associations between neurodevelopmental impacts in infants at 12 mo of age and lactational exposure to PCB 153, and observed that &#8220;the median PCB 153 concentration (in breast milk) in our study population would be much lower than in the study with the lowest PCB 153 concentration that was previously reviewed&#8221; (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">Longnecker et&#160;al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Second, various issues with study design must be acknowledged. For example, three important factors drive the overall level of exposure: the concentration of the chemical in the medium of interest, and the extent and duration of exposure. In an ideal study seeking to explore associations between exposures to environmental chemicals in breast milk and infant and child health outcomes, the chemical(s) of interest would be measured in multiple breast milk samples over the duration of lactation, and data would be collected on exclusive versus partial breastfeeding and the number of weeks that the infant was breastfed. Collection of this type of information places demands on the new mother as well as on the resources available to the investigators. However, without these data, exposure misclassification is more likely, and it is not known in which direction the misclassification could bias the results; either direction is possible.</p><p>In terms of physicochemical properties, two general classes of environmental chemicals in breast milk have been explored for their associations with health outcomes in infants and children: those with short physiological half-lives (i.e., hours to days or weeks) and those with long half-lives (i.e., years). For the former, it is well established that variability in chemical concentrations in the body can be quite high and that one measurement may be insufficient for characterizing longer-term exposures (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Braun et&#160;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Johns et&#160;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr">Meeker et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). Although most of the studies on variability in levels of short-lived chemicals have used urinary biomarkers, there is no reason to assume that this variability will not be observed in breast milk samples as well.</p><p>For chemicals with long half-lives, the conventional wisdom is that concentrations in breast milk would slowly decline over the duration of breastfeeding as historically accumulated levels in the mother would be mobilized and depurated (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">LaKind 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, recent research conducting careful examinations of levels of these types of chemicals over the course of lactation has revealed a more complex picture, with some concentrations remaining relatively constant in breast milk over time and others either increasing or decreasing at variable rates (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Hooper et&#160;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c116" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen et&#160;al. 2010a</xref>). At this time, it is not known what drives these differences, although women&#8217;s current dietary exposures may play a role (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">LaKind 2007</xref>) as may proximity to products containing these chemicals, particularly for flame retardants. Regardless, for both classes of chemicals, it is highly unlikely that one measurement of a chemical from one sample of milk will be able to fully capture infant exposure. An exception to this would be an early life study in which the sample was collected shortly postpartum and the health outcome was assessed at the same time or soon thereafter.</p><p>The extent and duration of breastfeeding provides information on the total amount of breast milk consumed over the course of lactation until weaning is complete. According to estimates by the U.S. EPA (<xref rid="c120" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), an exclusively breastfed infant consumes approximately <inline-formula><mml:math id="m76"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>600</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#8211;</mml:mo><mml:mn>900</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">mL</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> breast milk/day over the first 6 mo of life. In contrast, an infant who is partially breastfed might consume on the order of 60% of that amount. Further, knowing the duration of breastfeeding is essential to estimating overall exposure to a chemical of interest. Therefore, a robust exposure assessment incorporates information on whether and for how long an infant was exclusively breastfed.</p><p>We are unaware of any chemical included in this assessment that would involve exposures via breastfeeding to the exclusion of <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures. Because of this complication, it is necessary to account for potential impacts of <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures when attempting to ascribe a particular health outcome to exposures via breastfeeding. Some of the studies reviewed in this paper attempted to distinguish between these two exposure pathways by determining <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures using cord blood measures or maternal blood measures during pregnancy or immediately postpartum and using this information in their analyses. However, many studies made no attempt to assess <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures, making it virtually impossible to determine which window of exposure, or whether both, might be related to an observed outcome. Identifying the sensitive window(s) of development and exposure is important for understanding potential impacts of chemicals in breast milk and for providing information to doctors and parents about infant nutrition.</p><p>Given the paucity of data characterizing background exposures at any given point in time in the countries where studies were conducted, we are not able to place the cohorts&#8217; exposure levels within contemporary and geographically relevant distributions of background exposures. However, many of the cohorts described in this paper were recruited decades ago at a time when some classes of chemicals such as dioxins, furans, and PCBs were present in the environment and in humans at much higher concentrations than today. Our review&#8217;s findings may be less certain or pertinent for exposures above or below the range of exposures in the included studies. Wilhelm et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c133" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>) specifically addressed this question and reported that while in the D&#252;sseldorf birth cohort both mental and motor development were negatively associated with PCBs in breast milk, this finding was not repeated in a cohort recruited some years later (the Duisburg cohort), suggesting that more recent levels of PCBs &#8220;no longer apparently impair neurodevelopment of infants.&#8221; Pan et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) noted that their cohort had much lower <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8242;-DDE levels compared to Rogan et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c103" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>), and generally found no association between exposure to persistent chemicals and neurodevelopment at 12 mo of age, except between <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8242;-DDE exposures and decreased gross motor score in boys. Of the studies reporting unfavorable, nontransient effects associated with organochlorine chemicals in breast milk, most were studies of cohorts recruited in the early 1990s (Table S1).</p><p>There have been few attempts to collect population-wide data on environmental chemicals in breast milk, and no comprehensive data are available for the United States (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2001</xref>). In the absence of data, it is challenging to establish a baseline range of &#8220;background&#8221; levels of chemicals in breast milk in this country or to identify individuals or populations that may experience exposures above that range. Although data on concentrations of most chemicals in U.S. breast milk are generally lacking, concentrations of dioxins and furans have declined from 1975 to 2005 (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">LaKind 2007</xref>). Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that serum concentrations of dioxins, furans, and dioxin-like PCBs in the United States have decreased by more than 80% since the 1980s (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">CDC 2017</xref>), and it is reasonable to assume that breast milk concentrations have similarly decreased (<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">Marchitti et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). This finding provides some assurance that current concentrations for some of the chemicals discussed in this review are lower than concentrations observed in the cohorts that were recruited in the 1980s and 1990s. Similar data for the same timeframe for organochlorine pesticides are not available. However, regarding PBDE flame retardants, penta-BDE products were phased out in 2004, and mean serum concentrations of PBDEs decreased from 2003&#8211;2004 to 2005&#8211;2008, although the differences for most congeners were not statistically significant (<xref rid="c106" ref-type="bibr">Sjodin et&#160;al. 2014</xref>). More recently, Guo et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) found that between 2003&#8211;2005 and 2009&#8211;2012, total PBDEs in the milk of women in California declined by approximately 39%.</p><p>Other study design limitations commonly encountered in this body of literature include small sample size or lack of demonstrated adequacy of statistical power, narrow focus with regard to health outcomes, and incomplete exposure assessment (e.g., lack of data on breastfeeding duration and/or exclusivity, additional exposure sources during and after infancy).</p><p>A third issue critical to interpreting the information in this review relates to whether statistically significant findings in the epidemiological literature reviewed here are of clinical significance. Subclinical effects should be placed into context when describing study results to health care providers and families because these results, although meaningful at the population level and potentially important from an overall public health perspective, should be interpreted together with information on health benefits associated with breastfeeding and potential risks associated with environmental chemicals in formula when informing personal decisions regarding infant nutrition. For several of the studies that reported a statistically significant association between exposures from breastfeeding and health or biomarker outcomes, the results were characterized by the authors as subtle and/or with uncertain clinical significance [see, for example, Huisman et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">1995a</xref>); Jacobson et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>); Koopman-Esseboom et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>); Pluim et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, <xref rid="c96" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>); ten Tusscher et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>); Walkowiak et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>); Winneke et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c136" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>)]. Further, statistically significant findings were sometimes reported in an early assessment of a specific cohort but were no longer observed when the cohort was reassessed at a later age [e.g., Winneke et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c136" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>)], suggesting transiency in effect.</p><p>Fourth, in attempting to understand windows of exposure that may be related to a specified outcome, the infant stage presents a particularly complex exposure problem. Even with a detailed exposure assessment with serial sampling from time of conception throughout infancy (which none of the studies reviewed here conducted), it can be extremely difficult to separate out potential effects of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures. Although one could argue that, for public health protection efforts, it is important to understand early life exposures during all of these periods, it may be especially important to separate effects resulting exclusively from prenatal exposure from those that may also result from exposure during breastfeeding as this has implications for advice provided by health care practitioners regarding infant nutrition.</p><p>Fifth, although it would be useful to be able to compare cohort exposures across studies, infant lactational exposure is related not only to chemical levels in breast milk but also to duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. Almost none of the studies evaluated these aspects of exposure. Cross-study interpretation is also generally hindered by differences in the numbers/types of chemicals measured across different studies (e.g., differences in congeners assessed within a chemical class), and by differences in the range of exposures represented in different study populations, which led to differing definitions of &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; exposure levels between studies.</p><p>Sixth, from a public health perspective, shifts in infant/child health outcomes associated with environmental chemicals in breast milk are important to recognize and can be used to support recommended reductions in exposures in the general population. However, recommendations to limit infant exposure to breast milk would be short-sighted without also considering the health benefits of breastfeeding and potential risks associated with exposure to environmental chemicals in formula in addition to comparisons of <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposures. For example, research would be needed to confirm that any negative outcomes observed in exposed breastfed infants exceeded negative outcomes in a similar formula-fed cohort of infants. Unfortunately, the literature on this is extremely sparse. However, in an overview of the literature on PCBs in breast milk and infant outcomes, Jorissen (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) concluded that although breastfed infants experienced higher exposures to PCBs in comparison with formula-fed infants, they fared better than formula-fed infants in terms of neurological development, physical growth, and immunological status. For dioxin-like compounds, although Koopman-Esseboom et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) observed a transient significant negative association between postnatal dioxin/PCB exposure and psychomotor development at 7 mo of age at the two highest exposure levels, they noted that breastfed infants never scored significantly lower than formula-fed infants. Formula-fed comparison groups are needed in epidemiological studies to inform this discussion.</p><p>Seventh, aspects of study design in this body of literature limited our ability to interpret the results. For example, many of the studies included measurements of several chemicals and assessments of many outcomes; if such a study reports one or two significant findings in their examination of what can be 20 or more associations, it becomes more likely that significant findings were due to chance (i.e., multiple comparison issue). This was highlighted by Lynch et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) in their discussion of a significant association between PCB-153 and decrements in motor development; they note &#8220;we cannot rule out that our findings are due to chance alone, given the number of hypothesis tests that were performed as a part of this study.&#8221; Also, for studies that follow a cohort over a long time period (e.g., for years after weaning), there is a lack of information on possible confounding factors that may influence outcomes in older children. Although in some cases, measures of persistent environmental chemicals (e.g., PCBs) in older children were included, as noted by Engel and Wolff (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), use of these measures &#8220;cannot be used as a surrogate for perinatal exposure because body size changes dramatically during early life, and similarly dramatic and unpredictable changes in child PCB levels occur due to breastfeeding, weight gain, and continued dietary exposure.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, there is also a larger design issue that applies to the literature as a whole: Despite the large number of epidemiological studies that have investigated associations between environmental chemicals in breast milk and health outcomes, there has been very little replication of study design across studies, and limited replication of study results even for studies with similar designs, which limits our ability to draw confident conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we provide a critical examination of the environmental epidemiological literature on associations between environmental chemicals in breast milk and infant/child health outcomes. Our goal was to draw information from the literature that can be used to inform public health discussions about a sensitive life stage (i.e., infancy and early childhood). This review revealed that, although a relatively large number of cohorts has been studied, the number of chemicals addressed by the body of research is relatively small. Further, the number of high-quality studies (for example, those with rigorous exposure assessments) is limited, as is the number of studies that have replicated findings from earlier studies.</p><p>It is clear from this review that more research is needed to fully inform our understanding of the potential for lactational exposures to environmental chemicals to impact health outcomes during infancy or at later life stages. This research needs to include properly powered studies and adequate recruitment of study participants from the high and low ends of the exposure distributions. Clearly, to synthesize literature and examine the weight of the evidence&#8212;in particular for observational research&#8212;more than one study on a given exposure&#8211;outcome assessment (i.e., study replication) is also needed. Our review highlighted the general lack of study replication in the current body of literature. We strongly recommend that future study designs include sufficiently similar components to previous studies such that evidence synthesis can be conducted.</p><p>Although the research needs identified above are essential, we note that exposure assessment can be considered the Achilles heel of environmental epidemiology, and many of the data gaps described in this review attest to this. We therefore describe here in detail exposure assessment-related gaps and research needs:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Chemical mixtures: Very few studies examine chemical mixtures beyond particular groups of congeners, such as dioxins, furans, and PCBs. Assessment of mixtures is a difficult but necessary step forward in understanding chemical&#8211;outcome associations. As new chemicals are introduced into the marketplace, resources and tools are needed to analyze breast milk for their presence. For the mixtures that are currently the subject of study, agreement on a consistent approach to reporting will be vital to conducting interstudy comparisons. For example, all future studies of PCBs could include congener-specific analyses as well as summing of congeners, and studies focused on dioxin-like chemicals could include a TEQ assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Chemicals in infant formula: There is a dearth of U.S.-specific data on concentrations of environmental chemicals in infant formula powder and reconstituted formula. A full picture of potential effects of postnatal exposures to environmental chemicals is incomplete without epidemiological studies on environmental chemicals in infant formula (reconstituted with drinking water or ready to use) and infant/child health outcomes. Further, epidemiology studies of environmental chemicals in breast milk should include a comparison formula-fed group (with measures of prenatal exposures via cord blood) to increase the ability to explore separate associations between health outcomes and exposures at different life stages.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Distinguishing between prenatal and lactational exposures: It can be a challenge to assess the relative contributions of prenatal and breastfeeding exposures to associated health outcomes. Some studies have included a comparison group of formula-fed infants to observe potential effects of prenatal chemical exposure in the absence of lactational exposure. However, interpreting the results from comparisons between breastfed and formula-fed infants can be complicated, especially when the outcomes of interest may differ between these two groups independent of specific chemical exposures. Other approaches to address this issue involve the incorporation of <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposure data (e.g., cord blood or maternal blood chemical levels) into analyses of associations between breastfeeding exposures and health outcomes. Studies might also use pharmacokinetic models to estimate exposures at different life stages and to distinguish effects resulting from prenatal exposure from effects resulting from exposure during infancy (<xref rid="c123" ref-type="bibr">Verner et&#160;al. 2010</xref>). Additional studies implementing approaches such as these would allow for a much more precise determination of the likelihood for potential health outcomes of exposure during the breastfeeding period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes in chemical concentrations during lactation: To accurately assess infant exposures to persistent, lipophilic chemicals via breastfeeding, data on the concentrations over the entire duration of lactation are needed (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Fenton et&#160;al. 2005</xref>). An early synopsis of the literature on changes in concentrations of persistent chemicals indicated that concentrations declined over the course of lactation, in accordance with the hypothesis that the levels of these chemicals are primarily a reflection of the lifetime exposures of the mother; thus, with continued lactation, the accumulated stores of chemicals in the mother&#8217;s lipids would be eliminated, and concentrations in her milk would decline accordingly (a process referred to as depuration) (<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2011</xref>). This hypothesis also found support in the literature indicating that multiparous women have lower concentrations of persistent chemicals in breast milk than primiparous women (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2004</xref>), although not all studies have observed this decline with increasing parity (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Harris et&#160;al. 2001</xref>). More recent longitudinal studies designed to quantify the rates of depuration for several types of persistent lipophilic chemicals (dioxins, furans, PCBs, PBDEs, organochlorine pesticides) (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Hooper et&#160;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2009</xref>) found no consistent evidence of substantial&#8212;or in some cases any&#8212;depuration. In contrast, Thomsen et&#160;al. (<xref rid="c117" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>) reported decreasing concentrations of PBDEs, hexabromocyclododecane, PFASs, and PCBs in breast milk over 12 mo of lactation. Changes in physiology during pregnancy and postpartum complicate this analysis (e.g., blood loss at delivery). Further, the relative impact of the mothers&#8217; current exposure versus lifetime exposure on breast milk chemical concentrations is not understood (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">LaKind 2007</xref>). Thus, a full understanding of changes in concentrations of these chemicals in breast milk over the course of lactation will ultimately require a longitudinal exposure/biomonitoring study that captures changes in mothers&#8217; exposures during lactation while also measuring concentrations of lipophilic environmental chemicals in the mother&#8217;s adipose tissue, serum, and milk.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Even fewer data are available on variability in breast milk chemical concentrations for short-lived chemicals. Based on measurements of the chemicals in serum and urine, large day-to-day or even hour-to-hour variability is anticipated (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">LaKind et&#160;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c111" ref-type="bibr">Teeguarden et&#160;al. 2011</xref>), making estimates of infant exposures highly uncertain. Studies on temporal variability of breast milk concentrations of short-lived chemicals are needed.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Based on this review, the overall strength of the evidence&#8212;though weak&#8212;did not reveal any consistency in health outcomes associated with exposures to environmental chemicals in breast milk at general population background levels. Our overall conclusion must be weighed with various uncertainties, including differences in background levels across studies that may not have captured the high or low end of the exposure distributions, the clinical meaning of reported outcomes, the difficulty of differentiating effects of pre- and postnatal exposures, and the lack of statistical power in some of the studies. Regardless of the chemical concentrations in breast milk, breastfed children have generally fared at least as well as formula-fed children in these studies (when formula-fed control groups were available for comparison). This speaks to the benefits of breastfeeding, even in light of evidence that exposures to some chemicals are higher in breastfed infants as compared to formula-fed infants.</p><p>Although our initial goal was to conduct a parallel assessment of environmental chemicals in infant formula and health consequences associated with those exposures, this was not possible due to a dearth of pertinent epidemiological literature on this topic. Because research on environmental chemicals in breast milk has the potential to affect decisions regarding infant nutrition, it is essential that epidemiological research on environmental chemicals in infant formulas and associations with various health outcomes be conducted. Researchers need to design studies that will help to better characterize infant exposures to environmental chemicals in breast milk and infant formula. Further, epidemiologists and risk assessors should incorporate those improved exposure characterizations in their efforts to examine health outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, the evidence compiled and evaluated here does not provide conclusive evidence of consistent or clinically relevant health consequences to infants exposed to environmental chemicals in breast milk at population background levels. Further, there is epidemiological evidence suggesting that some subtle effects observed in earlier studies when levels of persistent organic chemical levels in breast milk were higher than today&#8217;s levels are no longer observed (<xref rid="c133" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et&#160;al. 2008a</xref>). However, based on comparisons between breastfed infant exposure levels and current reference values and some epidemiological evidence of potential health risk from early life (including prenatal) exposures, it may be prudent to consider measures that would reduce maternal chemical exposures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ehp-126-096002-s003.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ehp-126-096002-s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ehp-126-096002-s002.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), by appointment of S.A.M. to the Postdoctoral Research Program at the Computational Exposure Division, administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through Interagency Agreement No. DW8992298301 between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. EPA, and by support to C.A. through Cooperative Agreement Number X3-83555301 between the U.S. EPA and the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH).
