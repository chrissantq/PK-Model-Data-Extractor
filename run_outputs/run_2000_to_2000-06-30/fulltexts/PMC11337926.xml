The primary purpose of this review is to provide an update on the first drug used clinically, sodium borocaptate (BSH), by the Japanese neurosurgeon Hiroshi Hatanaka to treat patients with brain tumors and the second drug, boronophenylalanine (BPA), which first was used clinically by the Japanese dermatologist Yutaka Mishima to treat patients with cutaneous melanomas. Subsequently, BPA has become the primary drug used as a boron delivery agent to treat patients with several types of cancers, specifically brain tumors and recurrent tumors of the head and neck region. The focus of this review will be on the initial studies that were carried out to define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BSH and BPA and their biodistribution in tumor and normal tissues following administration to patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas and their subsequent clinical use to treat patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas. <italic toggle="yes">First</italic>, we will summarize the studies that were carried out in Japan with BSH and subsequently at our own institution, The Ohio State University, and those of several other groups. <italic toggle="yes">Second</italic>, we will describe studies carried out in Japan with BPA and then in the United States that have led to its use as the primary drug that is being used clinically for BNCT. <italic toggle="yes">Third</italic>, although there have been intense efforts to develop new and better boron delivery agents for BNCT, none of these have yet been evaluated clinically. The present report will provide a guide to the future clinical evaluation of new boron delivery agents prior to their clinical use for BNCT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="cac212582-kwd-0001">Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)</kwd><kwd id="cac212582-kwd-0002">boronophenylalanine (BPA)</kwd><kwd id="cac212582-kwd-0003">brain tumors</kwd><kwd id="cac212582-kwd-0004">head and neck cancer</kwd><kwd id="cac212582-kwd-0005">sodium borocaptate (BSH)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="13308"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>August 2024</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.4.7 mode:remove_FC converted:21.08.2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

BPA was used initially to treat patients with cutaneous melanomas [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and subsequently patients with brain tumors [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which is the focus of this review.

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for the use of BNCT to treat tumors of the head and neck region. BNCT is based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when the stable isotope, boron&#8208;10, is irradiated with low&#8208;energy (0.025 eV) thermal neutrons to produce boron&#8208;11 in an unstable form, which undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high&#8208;linear energy transfer (LET) alpha particles (stripped down helium nuclei) and recoiling lithium&#8208;7 nuclei, as shown below [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, and samples of tumor and blood were taken from individual animals.

Upon his return to Japan, Hiroshi Hatanaka, a neurosurgeon who had been a visiting scientist in Soloway's laboratory, initiated a clinical trial in patients with brain tumors [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] treated a total of 77 patients with malignant brain tumors of varying histopathologic types, and among these, 40 purportedly were high&#8208;grade gliomas. Initially, patients had de&#8208;bulking surgery to remove as much tumor as possible, followed at varying time intervals thereafter with BNCT. Neutron irradiation was carried out at four different Japanese nuclear reactors producing low&#8208;energy (0.025 eV) thermal neutrons. Due to their limited depth of penetration, this required that irradiation be administered following removal of a portion of the skull and reflection of the overlying skin flap [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This was done in order to increase the depth of penetration of the thermal neutrons and to prevent damage to the skin, which would have occurred if it had not been reflected. Initially, BSH was administered via the carotid or vertebral arteries [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and subsequently intravenously, although it is unclear when this transition occurred. Among the first group of 77 patients that had been treated, those with cortical or subcortical tumors had a 5&#8208;year survival rate of 58% and a 10&#8208;year survival rate of 29% [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As it turned out, these survival data were too good to be true. Most likely, the majority of these patients probably had lower grade rather than high&#8208;grade gliomas. The fact that they were of lower grade was substantiated by a recent case report by Kamano et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] on a patient with a diffuse astrocytoma, who had been treated by Hatanaka. BSH was administered via the left internal carotid artery (80 mg/kg) the night before treatment and BNCT was carried out using an unspecified nuclear reactor, which required a radiation time of 5.5 h. The histopathology of the original tumor was unknown, but presumably it was a low&#8208;grade glioma, which was apparent when the patient's tumor recurred 7 years later. The patient underwent a second resection of a tumor mass, the histopathology of which revealed grade III radiation damage but no viable tumor cells [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The patient subsequently survived for a total of 32 years following BNCT with a reasonably good quality of life. This case report supports the prevailing view that the unusually long survival times of Hatanaka's patients were in large part due to the fact that they had lower rather than higher grade gliomas. Be that as it may, his results were impressive enough to stimulate an interest in BNCT, which had fallen into decline following studies at the MGH [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Farr et&#160;al.&#8217;s [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] unsuccessful clinical trials in the 1950's. Following Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s encouraging reports [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], clinical studies were initiated in a number of countries, including the United States, Finland and several other European countries, using either BSH or the more promising drug, BPA.

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], BPA became the drug of choice for BNCT.</p><p>Almost 10 years later, Hatanaka et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provided an update on their original report [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As of December 1992, 119 patients with gliomas of varying grades had been treated using BSH as the boron delivery agent [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Eighteen out of 87 patients, treated on or before May 1987, had lived longer than 5 years, and 9 of them had lived longer than 10 years out of 53 patients operated on or before May 1982. Among the latter, 2 had died at 12 and 17 years following BNCT. Based on these results, it was concluded that BNCT could produce &#8220;cures&#8221; of what had been regarded as incurable high&#8208;grade brain tumors. Sadly, Hiroshi Hatanaka died in May 1994, but in 1997 Nakagawa et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] published an update on their clinical studies using BSH as the boron delivery agent to treat patients with gliomas of varying grades. Between 1968 and 1997, a total of 149 patients received BSH as part of their treatment with BNCT following de&#8208;bulking surgery. Among these, 64 patients had a diagnosis of glioblastomas (GBM), 39 had lower grade anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 17 had grade I or II astrocytomas, and 29 had other tumor types. Finally, there were 29 patients with other types of brain tumors. The patients with gliomas had an overall response rate of 64%. The 2&#8208;year survival rate was 12% for patients with GBMs and 56% for patients with AAs. A more realistic picture of the histopathologic diagnoses of Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s 173 patients [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], treated between 1968 and 1985, subsequently was provided by Nakagawa et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Of those patients who lived more than 3 years, only 10 had GBMs, 14 had AAs, and 9 had low&#8208;grade astrocytomas, and the histopathology of the remainder was not specified. Based on this, Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s original report [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] of long&#8208;term survivors of patients who purportedly had GBMs was based in part on the erroneous histopathologic classification of their tumors. However, the 3&#8208;year survival rate of these patients was at least as good as, if not somewhat better than, those patients who had received conventional therapy consisting of surgery and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with bis&#8208;chlorethyl&#8208;nitroso&#8208;urea (carmustine) during the same time period. The sum and substance of all of the above was that Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s clinical results were sufficiently promising to result in significant funding from both the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy to support BNCT&#8208;related research and further clinical trials in the United States.</p></sec><sec id="cac212582-sec-0030"><label>3</label><title>CLINICAL STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN JAPAN USING BSH AS A BORON DELIVERY AGENT</title><p>The only other clinical study carried out in Japan to evaluate BSH as a boron delivery agent was that of Takagaki et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which consisted of a group of 11 patients who purportedly were diagnosed with GBM. All of these patients had received BSH at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight at 2.5&#8208;16 h prior to surgical removal of their tumors. Boron concentrations in tumor and blood were determined quantitatively by prompt gamma spectroscopy and qualitatively at the cellular level by alpha track autoradiography. There was considerable variability in the brain tumor boron concentrations both quantitatively and qualitatively at varying time intervals following the 90&#8208;minute infusion of BSH. Variability in large part was due to differences in the time intervals between BSH administration and debulking surgery, which ranged between 2.5 h and 19 h. As might be expected, there was great variability in the blood boron concentrations, which ranged from 1.6 to 26.6 ppm, and in the tumor boron concentrations, which ranged from 0.5 to 8.6 ppm. These very low tumor boron concentrations would have limited the depth of penetration of thermal neutrons to 12.8 cm. However, no details relating to the neutron irradiation procedure itself were provided. It was very confusing that the biodistribution study involved 11 GBM patients, but the survival data were reported for 16 patients, and no explanation for this inconsistency was provided by the authors. A 3&#8208;year survival rate of 31% was reported for 16 patients and a 2&#8208;year survival rate of 50% for 8 patients. Plain and simple, these numbers do not add up! Again, the survival data seemed too good to be true. The most likely explanation for the discrepancy was that some patients in the study had lower grade rather than high&#8208;grade GBMs, which also had been the case with Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s patients [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study 11961 at the Petten High Flux Reactor located in Petten, the Netherlands. As of the time of the writing of their final report, a total of 30 patients had been entered into the study, but only 26 had received BNCT. Neutron irradiation was given in 4 fractions on 4 consecutive days. One day prior to the first irradiation, 100 mg of BSH/kg body weight were administered intravenously. On the following days, both the amount of BSH and its time of administration were modified to attain an average blood boron concentration of 30 parts per million (ppm) over the 4 fractions of BNCT. Of the 26 patients who received BNCT, the mean blood boron concentration over the 4 days was 30.2 ppm. Only one patient developed serious radiation treatment&#8208;related toxicity following BNCT. Acute radiation toxicity involving the brain was slightly less than that observed following conventional external beam photon radiation, and late toxicity outside of the brain was mild. The mean survival time (MST) of the all of the patients was not significantly different from one another. All of the patients either died of recurrent brain tumors or had recurrent brain tumors at the time of writing of their final report [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The MST of the patients deemed not candidates for BNCT was 6.5 months, and they all died due to local progression of their GBMs. It was concluded that additional studies were necessary in order to come to a definitive conclusion as to the suitability of BSH as a boron delivery agent. To the best of our knowledge, the only other clinical study using BSH was that of Burian et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in Czech Republic. A total of 5 patients were treated at the epithermal neutron facility at the LVR&#8208;15 reactor at the Nuclear Research Institute Rez (Rez, Czech Republic), but the number of patients was not high enough to evaluate the efficacy of BNCT.</p><p>Hidegh&#233;ty et&#160;al.

The average tumor boron concentration was 19.9 &#177; 9.1 ppm for the patients who were treated with 100 mg of BSH/kg body weight group and 9.8 &#177; 3.3 ppm for those with 22.9 mg of BSH/kg body weight. The corresponding tumor:blood concentration ratios were 0.6 &#177; 0.2 and 0.9 &#177; 0.2 for the patients who were treated with 100 and 22.9 mg of BSH/kg body weight, respectively. The average brain boron concentrations were reported for 4 patients who were treated with 100 mg of BSH/kg body weight group, and the mean was 6.6 &#177; 2.6 ppm. However, 3 or more tumor tissue samples were taken from only 3 patients. In contrast, as had been reported by Goodman et&#160;al.

This study, funded by the US Department of Energy, consisted of a group of 25 patients (10 men and 15 non&#8208;pregnant women), 21 years of age or older, with pre&#8208;operative diagnoses of GBMs or AAs. Twenty&#8208;two of them were patients at the Beijing Neurosurgical Institute (BNI, Beijing, China), which at that time saw the largest number of patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas than any other institution in the world, and 3 were patients at the OSU Medical Center. Of the 25 patients, 19 had tumors that were subsequently confirmed by histopathologic examination in the Department of Pathology at OSU to be either GBMs or AAs. These 19 patients constituted the study population, and the remaining 6 had neither of these two types of brain tumors and therefore were excluded from the study. The study plan had been reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Review Committee of OSU and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which assigned an Investigational New Drug number (34687) to BSH. Since a major part of this study involved Chinese patients at the BNI, the study also received approval by the relevant Chinese health authorities, including the Ethics Committee of the BNI, the Beijing Municipal Health Authority, which has jurisdiction over the BNI, and the Drug Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese equivalent to the US FDA. Most importantly, because this was a biodistribution and pharmacokinetic study, it had no influence on the type of surgery performed or the type of adjuvant therapy administered after surgery. The BSH drug (#672422, assigned by the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center) was synthesized and purchased as a drug substance from Centronics, Ltd. (Croydon, UK). The patients in this study were stratified into 3 groups and received 15 mg (3 patients), 25 mg (3 patients), or 50 mg of boron (13 patients), which corresponded to 26.5, 44.1, or 88.2 mg of BSH/kg body weight. The drug was infused intravenously in 500 mL of normal saline over 1 h. Since the report of Goodman et&#160;al.

For boron doses of 15, 25, and 50 mg/kg body weight, the corresponding blood boron concentrations at 6 h following administration were 20.8, 29.1, and 62.6 &#181;g/mL. The maximum solid tumor boron concentrations for a boron dose of 50 mg/kg body weight at 3&#8208;7 h after administration were 17.3 &#177; 10 &#181;g/g of tumor for AAs and 17.1 &#177; 5.8 &#181;g/g for GBMs. When averaged over all tumor samples of AAs and GBMs at 3&#8208;7 h after infusion, the tumor boron concentrations were 11.9 &#181;g/g, while the normal brain tissue boron concentrations were 5.5 &#177; 3.9 &#181;g/g brain for AAs and 4.6 &#177; 5.1 &#181;g/g for GBMs. The corresponding tumor:normal brain boron concentration ratios were 3.8 and 3.2, respectively. Samples of mixed normal brain and tumor had lower concentrations of boron than those of tumor. Following a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, blood boron concentrations decreased from 104 &#181;g/mL at 2 h to 63 &#181;g/mL at 6 h, and the muscle and skin boron concentrations were 39.2 &#181;g/g and 43.1 &#181;g/g, respectively, during the sampling period of 3&#8208;7 h. Taking all of the tissue and blood boron concentrations together, the best tumor boron concentrations were seen at a boron dose of 25 mg/kg body weight at 3&#8208;7 h following the end of administration of BSH. Normal brain tissue boron concentrations were consistently lower than tumor boron concentrations. However, tumor boron concentrations were lower than those required for a tumoricidal effect, and there was significant variability within different regions of the same tumor (Figure&#160;<xref rid="cac212582-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), as well as variability in the uptake of BSH from patient to patient, thereby making any estimate of the radiation dose delivered to the tumor very difficult, if not impossible. Based on these findings, it was concluded that intravenous administration of a single dose of BSH would not be sufficient for a successful therapeutic effect.</p></sec><sec id="cac212582-sec-0060"><label>6</label><title>STUDIES COMBINING BSH AND BPA AS BORON DELIVERY AGENTS</title><p>Based on the clinical studies of several other groups, summarized by Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], clinical interest in BSH as a boron delivery agent for BNCT of patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas almost completely ended. Subsequently, BPA became the only drug that today is being used clinically, with the exception of several reports describing the combination of BSH and BPA. The rationale for this was that the uptake of BSH was dependent upon a breakdown of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) within the tumor, while in contrast the uptake of BPA was dependent upon upregulation of the L&#8208;type amino acid transporter&#8208;1 (LAT1) in tumors [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As recently reported by Watanabe et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], there was an association between tumor expression of LAT1 and the potential efficacy of BNCT. In the first study using a combination of BSH (5 g) and BPA (13 g), Kawabata et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] described the clinical results obtained in 2 patients, one of whom had a GBM and the other a &#8220;glial&#8221; tumor, which were infused intravenously for 1, 12, and 1 h before neutron irradiation. A marked reduction in tumor volume was seen by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at varying numbers of days following BNCT. However, no long&#8208;term follow&#8208;up information was provided. In a second and more extensive study by Kawabata et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a total of 21 patients with malignant gliomas, the grades of which were not reported, were treated using a combination of BSH (100 mg/kg) and BPA (700 mg/kg), which were infused intravenously prior to neutron irradiation. The MST was 15.6 months for this cohort versus 10.3 months for 27 patients who had received external beam radiation therapy (XRT). In a second arm of the study, 10 patients received BNCT using both BSH and BPA as boron delivery agents, followed by XRT consisting daily fractions of 2 Gy for a total dose of 20&#8208;30 Gy. The MST was 23.5 months for this group compared to 14.1 months for those who only received BNCT, clearly indicating a significant therapeutic gain associated with the combination of BNCT and XRT, as had been reported by Barth et&#160;al.

Initially, this was administered peri&#8208;lesionally [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and subsequently intravenously to patients with cutaneous melanoma involving other regions of the body [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Coderre et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were the first to demonstrate that BPA, initially administered orally by gavage and subsequently intravenously, was effective in treating Fischer rats bearing intracerebral implants of the 9L gliosarcoma, which is highly immunogenic [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These studies laid the groundwork for the most comprehensive clinical pharmacokinetic and tissue biodistribution studies of BPA in patients with GBM carried out by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Varying doses (130&#8208;250 mg/kg body weight) of a fructose complex of BPA were administered intravenously 2&#8208;3 h prior to the start of the craniotomies of 16 patients with GBMs. Blood samples were taken during and after a 2&#8208;hour infusion of BPA. Multiple samples of tumor, normal brain and scalp were taken at surgery for boron determinations. Blood clearance was biphasic with the first phase (re&#8208;distribution) having a half&#8208;time (T<sub>1/2</sub>) of &#8764;1.2 h lasting 30&#8208;40 min and with the second phase (elimination) having a T<sub>1/2</sub> of &#8764;8.2 h. There was a high degree of variability in the tumor boron concentrations of multiple samples taken from the same patient, as well as patient&#8208;to&#8208;patient variability [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, tumor:blood boron concentration ratios were highly variable [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and appeared to be related to the cellularity of the samples [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Normal brain boron concentrations were either less than or equal to those seen in the blood. Tumor:blood boron concentration ratios were highly variable from patient to patient and ranged from 0.3 to 3.5. However, the data obtained were encouraging enough to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial between 1994 and 1998 in the Medical Department of the Brookhaven National Laboratory using the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The median time to progression and median survival time of 37 patients treated using the BMRR were 31.6 weeks and 13.0 months, respectively. Local control and survival times were similar to those of historical controls at the time the study was carried out between 1994 and 1999 [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These clinical results probably could have been predicted based on the biodistribution and tumor boron concentrations reported by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the relation of boron concentrations to tumor cellularity reported by Coderre et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, they laid the groundwork for a number of clinical studies carried out in Japan [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Finland [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Sweden [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the United States [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] for patients with brain tumors. The clinical study carried out in Sweden was noteworthy in that the dose of BPA was increased to 900 mg/kg body weight and the duration of its infusion was increased to 6 h [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A total of 12 patients were treated with BNCT, 11 of whom also received Temazolomide (TMZ).

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] on the tumor versus normal brain uptake of BPA in patients with brain tumors. More recently, Hiratsuka et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have presented a brief review on the pharmacokinetics of BPA in the blood following a two&#8208;stage infusion of 500 mg/kg of BPA (400 mg/kg BPA for 2 h and 100 mg/kg for 1 h) during neutron irradiation. However, no tumor boron concentrations were reported. Koivunoro et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] carried out a biokinetic analysis of tissue boron&#8208;10 concentrations in a group of 98 patients with gliomas who received a 2&#8208;hour intravenous infusion of BPA at doses ranging from 290 to 450 mg/kg. Blood samples were taken at 20&#8208;min intervals until the end of irradiation. A closed 3&#8208;compartment model was used to predict the changes in the total boron concentrations as a function of time in brain and tumor tissues during BNCT treatments. Although all of the calculated tumor:normal brain boron concentration ratios were in a very narrow range of 2.0&#8208;2.5, there was considerable variability in the calculated average tumor boron concentrations ranging from 44 to 93 mg/g tumor. Since these were calculated and not quantitatively determined boron concentrations, nothing could be said about the intra&#8208;tumoral variability of the boron concentrations, as had been determined by direct boron measurement of multiple samples from the same tumor, as reported by Elowitz et&#160;al.

In a study involving 15 patients with recurrent head and neck cancers, treated at the KURRI between June 2004 and February 2006, the total dose of BPA&#8208;fructose was 500 mg/kg body weight (400 mg/kg administered at a constant rate of 200 mg&#183;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for 2 h prior to irradiation, followed by the remaining 100 mg/kg during irradiation).

In contrast, the blood boron concentration immediately after irradiation in 5 patients treated with 250 mg/kg of BPA (fructose solution) could not be maintained at 20 ppm. The average boron concentration in whole blood immediately after irradiation in 8 patients treated with 500 mg/kg was 19.5 ppm, compared with an average of 30.4 ppm before irradiation, showing pre&#8208; and post&#8208;irradiation variability [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

If discrepancies between the pre&#8208;dose prescription and post&#8208;dose evaluation were large, the treatment would be suboptimal and could cause serious clinical problems such as adverse or ineffective treatment due to over&#8208; or under&#8208;delivered doses.

[<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], BSH initially was administered intra&#8208;arterially via the carotid or vertebral arteries at a dose of 30&#8208;50 mg/kg body weight the night before neutron irradiation. At some unknown point later in time the route was changed to intravenous administration at a BSH dose of 60&#8208;80 mg/kg body weight [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Subsequently, in the EORTC 11961 clinical trial [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], BSH at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight was administered intravenously 8&#8208;14 h prior to each neutron irradiation and a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight was administered during irradiation in order to achieve a blood boron concentration of 30 ppm. After infusion of BSH, the tumor:blood concentration ratio was 1.2 &#177; 0.4, and the corresponding tumor:normal tissue boron concentration ratios varied from 3.6:1 to 1:1 depending upon the tissue. BNCT was performed in 4 fractions on 4 consecutive days. Horn et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] carried out a detailed study on the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of BSH in a group of 10 patients with either astrocytomas or GBMs. BSH at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight was administered intravenously over 1 h, and craniotomies and tumor resections were carried out at varying time intervals ranging from 3 to 18 h following termination of the infusion. Average tumor boron concentrations ranged from 4.7 to 16.6 &#181;g/g tumor weight, but there were no data on intra&#8208;tumoral variability. Tumor:blood boron concentration ratios ranged from 0.318 to 3.357, and 6 of the 10 patients had tumor:blood boron concentration ratios of 1:5 or greater, which was considered the necessary ratio for effective BNCT. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the most advantageous time interval between BSH infusion and BNCT was 12 h. However, and most importantly, the retention of BSH in the kidneys was very high and potentially nephrotoxic if repeated infusions of BSH were given [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The intravenous route of administration was used in all of the other pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies of BSH, as summarized by Goodman et&#160;al.

They compared the intravenous route of administration to intra&#8208;carotid administration for BSH and BPA with or without BBB disruption. This was achieved by the intra&#8208;carotid infusion of a hyperosmotic solution (25%) of mannitol prior to the intra&#8208;carotid administration of either BSH or BPA [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The lowest tumor boron concentrations were seen in rats that received either BSH or BPA intravenously (12.9 and 20.8 &#181;g/g, respectively). The highest concentrations, almost 4&#8208;fold greater, were seen in rats that received BSH or BPA by intracarotid administration combined with BBB disruption (48.6 &#181;g/g and 94.5 &#181;g/g, respectively). The MST of F98 glioma&#8208;bearing rats that received either BSH or BPA by intravenous injection followed by BNCT were 33 and 37 days, respectively, and by intra&#8208;carotid injection were 40 and 52 days, respectively. The greatest increase in MST was seen in rats that received BPA by intra&#8208;carotid administration combined with BBB disruption (95 days). Based on the studies described above, it was concluded that maximizing the concentrations of BPA by intra&#8208;carotid administration combined with BBB disruption increased the physical radiation dose from 33.84 Gy to 119.67 Gy with a corresponding increase in the MST, as indicated above. Furthermore, optimizing the mode of delivery of BSH and BPA has significant impacts on tumor boron concentrations, MSTs, and the physical radiation and relative biological effective (RBE) doses delivered to the tumor.</p><p>Although Hatanaka et&#160;al.

To the best of our knowledge, other than Hatanaka et&#160;al.&#8217;s early protocol that employed intra&#8208;arterial administration of BSH, this route has never been investigated clinically using BPA. The one exception was a pilot study carried out by Cruickshank et&#160;al.

However, no further studies were reported using this approach. These data suggest that there still may be a role of BSH and BPA combined with some alternative methods to clinically enhance their delivery to brain tumors. This could include osmotic opening of the BBB [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] by means of pulsed or focused ultrasound [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].

That is not to say that BSH or derivatives of it might not be useful in the future as a boron delivery agent for certain types of tumors [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. What is especially attractive about BSH is that it has 12 boron atoms per molecule, and this provides a strong incentive to develop new delivery agents incorporating the BSH molecule.

There are many excellent reviews covering this topic, and the earliest of these were those of Hawthorne [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and Soloway et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], among the later are those of Zhu et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], Barth et&#160;al.

Yet, despite this voluminous literature relating to boron delivery agents for BNCT, to the best of our knowledge, none of these agents have been evaluated in any animals larger than mice and rats. The one exception was a tetrakiscarborane carboxylate ester of 2,4(a,b&#8208;dihydroxyethyl)&#8208;deuteroporphyrin IX [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], also known as boronated protoporphyrin (BOPP) which was synthesized by Kahl et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] and was evaluated in mice [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], rats [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], and dogs [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Biodistribution studies were carried out in C6 glioma&#8208;bearing mice [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] and 9L glioma&#8208;bearing rats [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], which revealed that BOPP had attained a tumor:normal brain boron concentration ratios of up to 400:1 [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Based on toxicologic [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], and tissue biodistribution studies [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] that were carried out in dogs, it was concluded that BOPP did not have clinically significant toxicity [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and tissue biodistribution studies suggested that BOPP might be suitable as a sensitizing agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is another binary therapeutic modality [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Based on these preclinical studies, Rosenthal et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] and Stylii et&#160;al.

BOPP was administered intravenously followed by intracerebral PDT delivered to the site of the tumor in patients with recurrent GBMs. Although there was a modest increase in patient survival times, it was concluded that infiltrative tumor cells invariably resulted in tumor progression, leading to death of the patients. However, as far as we can determine, there were no further studies using BOPP as a photosensitizer for PDT in patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas. Similarly, no clinical studies ever were initiated to evaluate BOPP as a boron delivery agent for BNCT. Rejection of BOPP as a boron delivery agent may have been based on studies in 9L gliosarcoma&#8208;bearing rats, which revealed unacceptable toxicity following intravenous administration and great variability in tumor boron concentrations following intracerebral administration by convection&#8208;enhanced delivery [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no other boron delivery agents have been used clinically for BNCT other than BSH, which was first used by Hatanaka et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and BPA, which was first used by Mishima et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The detailed clinical study with BSH, which was carried over 25 years ago by Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], provided a guide for future clinical studies to evaluate new boron delivery agents that have been shown to be promising in dogs and ultimately in humans. Based on the studies described above, it should be possible to reach a conclusion as to whether other agents should be a candidate for clinical use. New delivery agents will then require the submission to the appropriate local and national health authorities of all of the data obtained from the studies described above, including adverse events in animals that could be attributed to their administration. However, up to the present time, no agent other than BPA has reached this stage.</p><p>One of the advantages that Barth et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] and Yang et&#160;al.

These initially were carried out using the BMRR and subsequently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor (MITRR). Unfortunately, the BMRR was decommissioned many years ago, and MITRR, to the best of our knowledge, has not been used for BNCT studies since those carried out by Coderre et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Barth et&#160;al.

It remains to be determined if the new BNCT treatment facilities that have ABNSs also can be used for animal studies. Hopefully they can, and this would greatly advance therapeutic evaluation of the most promising of the myriad of boron delivery agents that have been described in the chemical and biological literature [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This is of paramount importance since the future success of BNCT largely depends on the development of new and better boron delivery agents than BPA and BSH, each of which has a number of significant shortcomings.</p><p>The theoretical advantage of BNCT compared to other radiotherapeutic modalities is that in theory it is the radiation oncologists&#8217; ideal type of radiation therapy, in that it specifically targets malignant cells and spares normal cells. However, this is not only an advantage but also a significant challenge, especially in using BNCT to treat patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas. The biodistribution studies by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with BPA and by Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with BSH in patients with GBMs and AAs revealed that there was significant variability in the uptake of these boron delivery agents in different samples of the same tumor. There are many reasons for this varibility, including the extensive phenotypic and genotypic cellular heterogeneity and their invasive properties, the admixture of necrotic and non&#8208;necrotic regions within the same tumor, and perhaps most importantly the complex tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>].</p><p>High&#8208;grade gliomas are the most difficult of all human cancers to treat by virtue of the fact that they are highly infiltrative of the normal brain and have a highly immunesuppresive microenvironment [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. All of these variables may have a significant impact on the cellular uptake of chemotherapeutic agents, and more specifically the two boron delivery agents BSH and BPA, which have been used clinically. The optimum method, dosing and timing to deliver BSH and BPA has yet to be determined, and at the present time the only reliable indicator of their efficacy is patient survival time. There are a number of different regimens for the delivery of BPA [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], but only one of them has been evaluated at the time of their first surgical resection although positron emission tomography imaging of 18&#8208;fluoro&#8208;BPA has provided some useful information on tumor uptake [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. However, it is incapable of detecting the variability of cellular uptake of BPA, and uptake alone can be very misleading. As reported by Kawabata et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] using the F98 glioma model, carboranyl porphyrins were administered intracerebrally to F98 glioma&#8208;bearing rats by convection&#8208;enhanced delivery. The tumor uptake of carboranyl porphyrins, as determined by direct current plasma&#8208;atomic emission spectroscopy (DCP&#8208;AES), was many times greater than that of BPA administered intravenously [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and yet the survival times were very similar to those obtained following intravenous administration of BPA [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. An explanation for this was provided by postmortem microscopic examination of the brains of these rats, which revealed that the apparent high tumor uptake of carboranyl porphyrins was attributable to uptake by tumor&#8208;infiltrating macrophages and not the tumor cells [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This observation provides a caveat to the studies carried out by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with BPA and by Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with BSH, that high tumor boron uptake, as determined by a method such as DCP&#8208;AES, does not provide an accurate picture of the actual cellular uptake of the boron delivery agent. Support for this was provided by Coderre et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] who related the boron concentrations with cellularity indices of 107 tumor samples. They found that tumor boron concentrations ranged from 2.7 to 41.3 &#181;g <sup>10</sup>B/g over the range of BPA doses that were administered. There were poor associations between the mean tumor boron concentration for each patient with the dose delivery regimen for BPA and therapeutic regimens [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This will be a major challenge for the future clinical success of identifying a boron delivery agent that will be effective for BNCT of patients with recurrent, high&#8208;grade gliomas.</p></sec><sec id="cac212582-sec-0130"><label>13</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To re&#8208;emphasize, the purposes of this review were twofold. <italic toggle="yes">First</italic>, to summarize the clinical pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies that have been carried out with BSH and BPA and how these have led to clinical trials for treating patients with high&#8208;grade gliomas. <italic toggle="yes">Second and third</italic>, and equally as important, to provide a template, as described in Table&#160;<xref rid="cac212582-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, on how new boron delivery agents might be evaluated before being used clinically to treat patients.

Sadly, none of these, except for BOPP [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="cac212582-bib-0119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], have reached the stage of clinical evaluation, and this was for PDT rather than BNCT. As reported by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], both BPA and BSH are less than ideal boron delivery agents for BNCT of patients with GBMs due to the great variability in their uptake in different regions of the same tumor. This variability unquestionably accounts for the less than curative clinical results obtained in treating patients with the most challenging of all human cancer, high&#8208;grade gliomas. The logistics of carrying out such clinical studies have been described by Elowitz et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and in even more detail by Goodman et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Unfortunately, however, both studies were published in the non&#8208;open access journal, <italic toggle="yes">Neurosurgery</italic>, and this has significantly limited their accessibility, even today. We hope that this review, will make available to a broad audience of readers interested in BNCT of what needs to be done to evaluate the most promising of the hundreds of boron delivery agents that, as of yet, are still in an early stage of pre&#8208;clinical evaluation. Conceivably, clinical studies of promising boron delivery agents initially could be carried out in patients with recurrent tumors of the head and neck region, where multiple samples could be taken in different regions of the same tumor. This is done by a surgeon, who is able to extend the margins of tumor resection when guided by a surgical pathologist in order to remove all of the tumor. The future success of BNCT is dependent upon the development of new and better boron delivery agents for not only brain tumors and head and neck cancers but also other types of cancers.</p><p>The various challenges that make BNCT clinical trials very complex to design, implement, and get meaningful clinical results have been summarized by Gupta et&#160;al. [<xref rid="cac212582-bib-0120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. One of the most significant challenges is that different boron delivery agents probably will have very different uptake pharmacokinetic and pharmacldynamic profiles in tumors and normal tissues. While it is common to report average boron concentrations in the tumor and critical structures, the micro&#8208;dosimetric impact of this high&#8208;LET radiation therapy is completely dependent on how unformly the <sup>10</sup>B is distributed within the tumor. Perhaps even more important is that all of the tumor cells presumptively must have the required amount of boron to sustain a lethal <sup>10</sup>B(n,&#945;)<sup>7</sup>Li capture reaction. To date, BNCT clinical trials have not focused on evaluating and standardizing the optimal boron dosing delivery regimen. Unfortunately, this has resulted in variations in the clinical results obtained in these trials. Not surprisingly, this has limited the enthusiasm of a large group of radiation oncologists for BNCT as a cancer treatment modality. If BNCT is to be widely accepted as a cancer treatment modality, there must be standardization of various aspects of the design of clinical trials, and implementation and reporting of their results. Most importantly, there is a need for a future plan to carry out multi&#8208;institution clinical trials, which have been the key to success in developing new cancer treatment modalities. This could become a reality with the increasing number of ABNSs in Japan, China, and hopefully in other countries.</p></sec><sec id="cac212582-sec-0140"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>The majority of the manuscript was written by Drs.
