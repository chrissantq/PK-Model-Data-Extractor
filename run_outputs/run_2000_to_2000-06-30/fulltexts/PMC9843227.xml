There is an urgent need to explore multimodal therapeutic regimens which are effective and safe for children. Large-scale studies have revealed abnormal cancer epigenomes caused by mutations and structural alterations of chromatin modifiers, aberrant DNA methylation, and histone modification signatures. Therefore, targeting epigenetic modifiers for cancer treatment has gained increasing interest, and inhibitors for various epigenetic modulators have been intensively studied in clinical trials. Here, we report a cross-entity, epigenetic drug screen to evaluate therapeutic vulnerabilities in MYC amplified MB, which sensitizes them to macrophage-mediated phagocytosis by targeting the CD47-signal regulatory protein &#945; (SIRP&#945;) innate checkpoint pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a primary screen including 78 epigenetic inhibitors and a secondary screen including 20 histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to compare response profiles in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT, n=11), MB (n=14), and glioblastoma (n=14). This unbiased approach revealed the preferential activity of HDACi in MYC-driven MB. Importantly, the class I selective HDACi, CI-994, showed significant cell viability reduction mediated by induction of apoptosis in MYC-driven MB, with little-to-no activity in non-MYC-driven MB, AT/RT, and glioblastoma in vitro. We tested the combinatorial effect of targeting class I HDACs and the CD47-SIRPa phagocytosis checkpoint pathway using in vitro phagocytosis assays and in vivo orthotopic xenograft models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CI-994 displayed antitumoral effects at the primary site and the metastatic compartment in two orthotopic mouse models of MYC-driven MB. Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed nuclear factor-kB (NF-&#954;B) pathway induction as a response to CI-994 treatment, followed by transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) expression, which enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion. We further show interferon-&#947; release and cell surface expression of engulfment (&#8216;eat-me&#8217;) signals (such as calreticulin). Finally, combining CI-994 treatment with an anti-CD47 mAb targeting the CD47-SIRP&#945; phagocytosis checkpoint enhanced in vitro phagocytosis and survival in tumor-bearing mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, these findings suggest a dynamic relationship between MYC amplification and innate immune suppression in MYC amplified MB and support further investigation of phagocytosis modulation as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy responses.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>Brain

Traditionally cancer has been defined as a genetic disease. However, disruption of epigenetic mechanisms can influence tumorigenesis likewise by inducing malignant cellular transformation and driving tumor progression.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, and post-transcriptional gene regulation by non-coding RNAs, directly influence gene expression patterns and cell identity. The best-studied epigenetic modifications are the methylation of the DNA base cytosine within so-called CpG island of gene promoter regions and the acetylation of lysine side chains of histone tails. The methylation of cytosine is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and the hypermethylation of CpG island in promoter regions is associated with transcriptional silencing of genes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> DNA methylation profiling has been widely applied for classifying brain tumors and helped to identify further layers of heterogeneity within entities.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, repression of gene transcription is also mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine side chains of histone proteins. Exploiting the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved DNAMT inhibitors (azacytidine and decitabine) for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) romidepsin, Zolinza (vorinostat), and belinostat (PXD101) for T-cell lymphomas such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In addition, dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape has been reported in several pediatric and adult brain tumor entities and constitutes a promising therapeutic approach.</p><p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and is composed of four distinct molecular subgroups, with additional layers of intertumoral heterogeneity. The four consensus subgroups, wingless, sonic hedgehog, group 3, and group 4, are characterized by distinct DNA copy number aberrations, mutational alterations, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression profiles.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Relative to all disease subgroups, group 3 MB is associated with a comparatively poor prognosis in current multimodal therapeutic regimens and aberrant activation of the proto-oncogene MYC in distinct group 3 subtypes, particularly confers dismal outcomes<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#8211;7</xref> with metastasis incidence of 39% and a less than 45% 5-year overall survival rate in tumor with MYC amplification. Metastatic dissemination at diagnosis is a well-established clinical predictor of poor prognosis in patients with MB.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previous studies have demonstrated consistently that group 3 MBs display the highest propensity for metastatic dissemination at diagnosis.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9</xref> Furthermore, most group 3 MBs recur metastatically<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and maintain or even acquire <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> amplification at recurrence<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;13</xref> while curative second-line treatment options are lacking and desperately needed for these patients.</p><p>In the current study, we performed drug screening to compare the antitumoral activity of epigenetic inhibitors (n=78) in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), MB, and glioblastoma. With our multientity study design, we aimed to provide an unbiased evaluation of selective activity emerging from the biological differences of the entities rather than identifying inhibitors with broad, unspecific cytotoxicity across entities. In our comparative analysis, we demonstrate a preferential therapeutic activity of HDACi in MYC-driven MB compared with the other brain tumors tested. We performed a targeted rescreen of commercially available preclinical and clinically approved HDACi (n=20) and identified CI-994 (tacedinaline), a class I specific HDACi, as the most selectively active compound for MYC-driven MB. CI-994 demonstrated in vivo efficacy against the primary tumor and, importantly, metastatic lesions in orthotopic xenograft models of MYC-driven MB. Lastly, we uncovered that CI-994 overcomes immune-evasion mechanisms in MYC-driven MB potentially by restoring the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway and inducing the expression of immunogenic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) on the tumor cell surface and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This, in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (CD47-signal regulatory protein &#945; (SIRP&#945;) phagocytosis blockers), provides a promising approach to improving the therapeutic efficacy against high-risk MB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>A detailed description of all cell models and culture conditions is provided in <xref rid="SP1 SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables 1,2</xref>.

Out of the 78 inhibitors screened, 48 drugs displayed a median IC<sub>50</sub> greater than 25&#8201;&#181;M (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 7</xref>), revealing that the majority of inhibitors showed negligible activity. However, 17 inhibitors showed significantly lower IC<sub>50</sub> values in MB compared with glioblastoma and AT/RT in vitro. Remarkably, 11 out of the 17 (65%) selective compounds were HDACi, demonstrating a clear over-representation of this inhibitor class (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 7</xref>). The preferential therapeutic activity of HDACi was even more notable when MB models were subdivided according to <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> status. We found significantly decreased IC<sub>50</sub> values for these 11 inhibitors when comparing <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB with non-<italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB (p=0.0019, <xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). Thus, we next focused on epigenetic inhibitors that exhibit preferential sensitivity in <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A, B</xref>). We identified 32 inhibitors with higher median activity in MYC-driven MB (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>, group 1), 40 inhibitors with no preferential activity (group 2), and 4 inhibitors that were less active in MYC-driven MB when compared with the median response in the other tested entities (group 3). Among the group of inhibitors with higher median activity in MYC MB, we identified 13 epigenetic inhibitors that were significantly more active when compared with the other tested entities. Again, the majority of these significantly active inhibitors were HDACi (n=9, 69%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A, B</xref>). Only six inhibitors demonstrated selective activity when in glioblastoma or AT/RT models were compared against the other cell lines together. Three inhibitors of the histone methyltransferase G9a were preferentially active in glioblastoma cell lines, validating our screening approach since G9a has already been shown to be a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma (<xref rid="SP9" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 7</xref>).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition, we identified two DNMTs inhibitors (5-azacytidine and fisetin) and the Jumonji inhibitor GSKJ4 as selectively active in AT/RT models (<xref rid="SP10" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 7</xref>).

Inhibitor response was subdivided into three groups. Group 1 consists of inhibitors that showed a lower median IC<sub>50</sub> for <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB compared with the remaining entities. Group 2 inhibitors were largely inactive across the entities, and group 3 inhibitors were less active in the <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB cell lines compared with the other entities. Inhibitors are sorted according to their respective p value when comparing the IC<sub>50</sub> values of <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB against the IC<sub>50</sub> values of all other cell lines (unpaired t-test). (B) The screened epigenetic library is composed of various inhibitor classes targeting different epigenetic modulators (the inner circle). Out of the 78 inhibitors screened, 13 drugs were significantly more active in <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB (outer layer). Nine of those selective inhibitors are HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), three compounds inhibit DNA methyltransferases, and one drug is an aurora kinase inhibitor.

The focused HDACi library included the previously evaluated HDACi (n=15) and was extended with the FDA-approved drugs panobinostat, romidepsin, and belinostat, as well as the well-characterized HDACi entinostat and tubastatin A. IC<sub>50</sub> values derived from both screens, are highly correlated (Pearson&#8217;s correlation r=0.956, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>). The FDA-approved drugs vorinostat, panobinostat, romidepsin, and belinostat showed substantial inhibition of cell viability across the three tumor entities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the low nanomolar range for panobinostat and romidepsin (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 8</xref>).

Significantly higher levels of IFN-&#947; were detected in all three cell lines (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>), with the highest response in D283 cells. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns is crucial for the success of the CD47-SIRP&#945; phagocytosis checkpoint immunotherapy. We assessed if CI-994 treatment induces phagocytosis of tumor cells and causes the release of DAMPs. We found that calreticulin was expressed on the surface of MYC-driven MB cells, and its cell-surface exposure was upregulated by CI-994 treatment (p&lt;0.05, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B, C</xref>).

The combination of CI-994 and anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) strongly enhanced phagocytosis of D425 cells by human PBMC-derived macrophages, whereas the treatment of anti-CD47 showed only a slight increase in phagocytosis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5E</xref>).

Our approach significantly enhances recent HDACi-related insights for <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> as we identify drugs that are specifically active in entities or even molecularly-defined subsets of tumors. In our primary screen, we demonstrated that HDACi are specifically active in <italic toggle="yes">MYC-</italic>driven MB compared with non-<italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> MB, AT/RT, and glioblastoma models. Although epigenetic dysregulation caused by, for example, aberrant methylation patterns or alterations of chromatin modulators is also commonly identified in AT/RT and glioblastoma, cell lines from these entities were, on average, less susceptible to our epigenetic inhibitor library. Our cross-entity comparison, therefore, indicates that targeting epigenetic modulators might be particularly promising for MB. In a targeted re-screen with an extended HDACi library, we identified CI-994 as the most promising and selective HDACi in <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB. CI-994 is an orally bioavailable class I specific HDACi, which crosses the blood-brain barrier.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Previous studies reported that CI-994 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in other tumor entities,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> but it was not examined in MB up to now.</p><p>Based on the selective activity of CI-994 in <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB and the attractive pharmacological features as well as the known side effect profiles of CI-994 for treating children with brain tumors, we prioritized this drug for in vivo testing. Our in vivo data not only demonstrate significantly extended survival in two orthotopic <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>-driven MB mouse models (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3D</xref>) but, importantly, reveal significant antitumoral activity against metastatic dissemination (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>). This addresses a pressing clinical challenge, as these tumors are commonly metastatic at diagnosis and at recurrence, which is associated with dismal prognosis, and therapeutic strategies are urgently required for these high-risk patients.</p><p>Downstream effects of class I specific HDACi and potential resistance mechanisms are currently unknown in MB. Using a transcriptomic approach, our data highlighted a significant induction of the NF-&#954;B pathway on CI-994 treatment, which was detected in multiple curated gene sets, and significant transcriptional activation was demonstrated using IPA (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 10</xref>). The NF-kB pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of tumor inflammation. As a controller of the transcription of cytokines and antimicrobial effectors, NF-kB is involved in promoting differentiation, development, and response in cells of innate and adaptive immune systems. MYC-driven neoplastic cells can bypass immune detection by regulating immune checkpoints through CD47 and programmed death-ligand 1.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Therefore, activation of NF-kB in MYC-driven MB cells may restore the immune response and sensitize these cells to immunotherapy. Here we observed an upregulation of tissue <italic toggle="yes">TGM2,</italic> a direct transcriptional target of NF-kB that is frequently upregulated during inflammation and wounding. Treatment with CI-994 increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by Grp3-MB tumor cells, which was inhibited by the blocking of TGM2 function. The CCL2/MCP-1, IL-1&#946;, &#932;&#925;F-&#945; and IFN-&#947; TH-1 responses explain the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophage response when Grp-3 MB xenograft bearing mice were treated with CI-994.</p><p>Recently, the important roles of macrophages in the surveillance and elimination of tumor cells, which was termed &#8216;programmed cell removal&#8217; (PrCR), have been revealed by us and other laboratory studies.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#8211;42</xref> The upregulation of anti-phagocytic &#8216;don&#8217;t eat me&#8217; signals on cancer cells protects them from PrCR, while blockade of such pathways enables PrCR and leads to the elimination of tumor cells by macrophages. The CD47/SIRP&#945; axis serves a broader role as a myeloid immune checkpoint frequently co-opted by tumor cells to avoid immune surveillance.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Previously we demonstrated that anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody has potent antitumor activity against a wide range of solid tumors, including adult glioblastoma<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and five etiologically distinct human pediatric brain tumors, including Grp3-MB (6). More recently, a number of studies have shown that inducing immunogenic cell death is an attractive approach to activating the immune microenvironment of &#8216;cold&#8217; tumors. Inducing immunogenic cell death and expression of DAMPs, such as calreticulin and phosphatidyl-&#173;serine on the cell surface, increase the immunogenicity of tumor cells to trigger immune responses engaging both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we demonstrate that sublethal doses of CI-994 caused tumor inflammation presumably through the activation of the NF-kB pathway leading to secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-&#947;. We further observe cell surface expression of calreticulin as well secretion of HMGB1. These, combined with the blockade of the CD47-SIRP&#945; phagocytosis checkpoint pathway, enhance macrophage-mediated tumor cell phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo, thereby enhancing the survival of mice with MYC-driven MB xenografts. While the blood-brain barrier is a major concern for the delivery of drugs from the systemic circulation to the brain prior, our previous studies have shown accessibility of the anti-CD47 Mab to the tumor bed. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that the central nervous system (CNS) is immune-accessible and interacts dynamically with the systemic immune system.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Inflammation also induces immune cells to migrate into the parenchyma by traveling a chemotactic response through (among others) IFN-&#947; inducible cytokine gradients, a key pro-inflammatory myeloid activator.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> Additionally, FcRn, a ubiquitous immunoglobulin receptor highly expressed in blood vessels in the brain, can facilitate IgG transport into the CNS.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Currently there are multiple clinical investigations targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis alone or in combination with reagents that enhance the do not eat me signal.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref></p><p>Our study demonstrates the efficacy of combining macrophage-checkpoint inhibition with HDACi for cancer immunochemotherapy against MYC-driven MB. The combination of anti-CD47 and HDACi eliminated MYC-driven cancer cells with increased efficacy due to the enhancement of the NF-kB mediated &#8216;eat-me&#8217; signals and antibody-dependent block of &#8216;don&#8217;t eat-me&#8217; signals. This may be an effective approach for treating high-risk MYC-driven MB.</p><supplementary-material id="SP13" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/jitc-2022-005871.supp13</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>
