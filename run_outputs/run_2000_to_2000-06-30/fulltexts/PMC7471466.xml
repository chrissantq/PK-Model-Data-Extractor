A recent study reported that nimesulide (NIM) could increase the liver injury risk of methotrexate. The latter was mainly metabolized by AOX to form hepatotoxic 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH MTX). Thus, we speculated that NIM could induce AOX. In this study, we investigated the potential induction of AOX activity by NIM using methotrexate as the probe substrate. Treatment of primary human and rat hepatocytes with NIM (20&#8201;&#956;M) for 24&#8201;h caused a 2.0- and 3.1-fold, respectively, increase in 7-OH MTX formation. Oral administration of NIM (100&#8201;mg&#183;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;d<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, for 5 days) to rats significantly increased the systematic exposure (6.5-fold), liver distribution (2.5-fold), and excretion (5.2-fold for urinary excretion and 2.1-fold for fecal excretion) of 7-OH MTX. The 7-OH MTX formation in liver cytosol from rats pretreated with 20, 50, and 100&#8201;mg&#183;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;d<sup>&#8722;1</sup> NIM for 5 days increased by 1.9-, 3.2-, and 3.7-fold, respectively, compared with that of rats pretreated with the vehicle. We revealed that the elevation of AOX activity was accompanied by an increase in AOX1 protein levels but not the corresponding mRNA levels. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that NIM can increase the AOX activity of humans and rats, and may raise concerns regarding the risk of drug interactions between NIM and AOX substrates in clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nimesulide</kwd><kwd>aldehyde oxidase</kwd><kwd>induction</kwd><kwd>methotrexate</kwd><kwd>hepatocytes</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>drug interaction</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; CPS and SIMM 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Aldehyde oxidase (AOX) is a member of the molybdo-flavoprotein enzyme family that is mainly localized in the cytosolic subcellular fraction.

However, AOX-mediated drug interactions are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate inhibitors and inducers. To date, no published studies have focused on AOX induction by commonly used clinical drugs. This study demonstrated for the first time that NIM, a commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, could increase the AOX activity of humans and rats.</p><p id="Par33">To our knowledge, CYP induction studies are usually conducted following 48&#8211;72&#8201;h of treatment of hepatocytes with a test inducer to achieve the maximal induction response. However, few studies have focused on the optimal induction time for AOX activity. Thus, the effect of induction time on the induction response of AOX was first investigated in our study. MTX was mainly metabolized to 7-OH MTX by AOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and was used as a probe substrate to evaluate the AOX activity. The AOX activity in rat hepatocytes decreased with the increase in the preincubation period, and no significant difference was observed in the induction response of 24&#8201;h compared with that of 48 or 72&#8201;h. Thus, 24&#8201;h was chosen as the hepatocyte induction time for AOX activity.</p><p id="Par34">Based on our previous studies, NIM was toxic to rat and human hepatocytes, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 40 and 213&#8201;&#956;M, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To avoid a toxic response, the NIM concentration ranges of 0&#8211;20 and 0&#8211;100&#8201;&#956;M were selected for the induction of AOX in rat and human hepatocytes, respectively. Treatment of rat and human hepatocytes with NIM for 24&#8201;h increased the 7-OH MTX formation in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that NIM could increase the AOX activity of humans and rats. The turnover of MTX to 7-OH MTX mediated by AOX was low in human and rat hepatocytes, indicating that human and rat AOX had a very low affinity for MTX. Similar results were also reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. 7-OH MTX was not detected in patients receiving conventional-dose therapy. However, with high dose (&gt;50&#8201;mg MTX/kg) therapy regimens employed for the treatment of certain cancers, as high as 33% of MTX could be excreted as 7-OH MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These data suggested that the conversion of MTX to 7-OH MTX was a dose-dependent phenomenon with the enzyme involved having a low affinity.</p><p id="Par35">Treatment of the rat hepatocytes with the NIM metabolites did not increase the 7-OH MTX formation, suggesting that the increase in rat AOX activity was due to NIM itself instead of its metabolites. Interestingly, treatment of human hepatocytes with 20&#8201;&#956;M M1 for 24&#8201;h increased 7-OH MTX formation by 1.4-fold, indicating that M1 could increase human AOX activity. The different effects of M1 on human and rat AOX activity suggested that species differences existed in AOX induction.</p><p id="Par36">Furthermore, in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the in vitro results. Oral administration of 100&#8201;mg&#183;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#183;d<sup>&#8722;1</sup> NIM to rats for 5 days significantly increased the systematic exposure (6.5-fold), liver distribution (2.5-fold), and the urinary (5.2-fold) and fecal (2.1-fold) excretion of 7-OH MTX, indicating that NIM significantly increased the 7-OH MTX formation in rats.</p><p id="Par37">The effect of NIM on AOX activity in rat livers was evaluated. Rats were administered NIM with different doses and times. The AOX activity in rat livers was characterized by the formation of 7-OH MTX in liver cytosols prepared from different groups of rats. A dose- and time-dependent increase in AOX activity was confirmed in the livers of rats in response to NIM. In addition to MTX, the metabolism of other AOX substrates was also enhanced. All these findings demonstrated that NIM pretreatment increased AOX activity in rat livers.</p><p id="Par38">Previous studies demonstrated that NIM underwent nitro-reduction by AOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. According to Paragas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], reductive transformation occurred at a second site within AOX that was kinetically distinct from the oxidative site. The nitro-reduction of NIM might be involved in AOX enzyme stabilization, thus increasing its activity. To test this hypothesis, various concentrations of NIM (5&#8211;20&#8201;&#956;M) were directly added to the RLC incubation of MTX. However, compared with the incubation containing no NIM, no significant difference in 7-OH MTX formation was observed (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), indicating that the increase in AOX activity by NIM was not due to direct activation.</p><p id="Par39">The protein and mRNA levels were analyzed to consider the mechanism involved. NIM increased the AOX1 protein level but decreased the AOX3 protein level in rat livers. Vila et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported that AOX1 and AOX3 oxidized the same spectrum of exogenous substrates, and AOX1 was more efficient than AOX3 in oxidizing various substrates. This might explain why the elevation of AOX activity in the liver of NIM-treated rats was observed, although the AOX3 protein level decreased. Consistent with the results obtained from rat experiments, a concentration-dependent increase in the AOX1 protein level was observed in human hepatocytes treated with NIM. Notably, there was no significant alteration of AOX mRNA levels after NIM treatment. The inconsistency between the mRNA level of AOX and the corresponding protein level and activity has been reported by a few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The studies by Calzi et al. showed that a correlation between AOX mRNA and protein levels in various tissues was not always evident, suggesting that both transcriptional and translational events controlled the expression of AOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Kurosaki et al. reported that despite similar amounts of AOX1 mRNA in the livers of male and female mice, the corresponding protein level and enzyme activity in the livers of male mice were significantly higher than those in female mice. It was likely that androgens regulated AOX activity by a translational or posttranslational mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Rivera et al. documented that there was a remarkable time lag between the accumulation of AOX1 mRNA and its translational products during the induction of AOX1 by dioxin, indicating that factors other than increased gene transcription contributed to the regulation of AOX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All these reports showed that the mechanisms by which NIM increased AOX activity were highly complicated and should be investigated from a variety of aspects, which would be the subjects of future studies.</p><p id="Par40">The <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC values of MTX also increased in the plasma of NIM-treated rats, which was not consistent with the results of only increasing the AOX activity due to NIM. It has been reported that MTX is a substrate of the uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and efflux transporters breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our previous studies also demonstrated that NIM was an inhibitor of OATPs and MRP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, the transporter-based drug interactions between NIM and MTX might affect the distribution and metabolism of MTX in rats. Herein, a sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was performed to evaluate the effect of NIM on the hepatobiliary disposition of MTX. NIM reduced the cellular plus biliary accumulation of MTX in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the biliary excretion index (BEI) of MTX was not changed after NIM treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). These results showed that NIM significantly inhibited the uptake of MTX and did not inhibit the efflux of MTX, which led to decreased liver exposure and increased plasma exposure of MTX in rats. Although MTX exposure in NIM-treated rat liver was reduced, the concentration of the metabolite 7-OH-MTX was still increased due to the increased AOX activity caused by NIM.</p><p id="Par41">In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that NIM could increase the AOX activity of humans and rats. Our results may partially explain the increased liver injury risk of MTX caused by the combination with NIM and may raise concerns regarding the risk of drug interactions between NIM and AOX substrates in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
