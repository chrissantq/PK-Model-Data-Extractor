Vascular access port systems are widely used in human medicine to provide long term central venous access in patients who require comprehensive intravenous fluid therapy, multiple administrations of medication or repeated blood sampling. In people, they are commonly implanted in the superior vena cava via a subclavian, cephalic or jugular vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In veterinary medicine the use of VAP systems is not common practice and literature on applications has been limited. Due to the reduced risk of infection, the limited chance for dislodgement and the ability to provide minimally invasive vascular access for repeated and long-term use, implantable VAP systems were previously suggested for both animal and human use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. VAP systems in the dog and cat can be valuable tools in experimental research, but also have clinical potential in veterinary medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Also, VAP systems were used in radiotherapy protocols requiring frequent anaesthesia to provide long-term venous access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">VAP implantation in the portal vein was advocated for regional chemotherapy of liver metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Permanent portal vein catheterization using a VAP was described in a human case series of repeated hepatocyte transplantations via the portal vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Use of VAP systems in canine portal veins has not been reported yet, as far as the authors know.</p><p id="Par9">A VAP system in dogs has been evaluated as part of a research project in which liver cells were transplanted into the liver via the portal vein &#8216;unpublished observations by H.S. Kruitwagen et al.&#8217;. The VAP system was intended to provide long-term, low-invasive portal venous access for the administration of cell suspensions and the collection of portal venous blood samples. The possibilities for direct measurement of portal venous blood pressure were also explored. The aim of this preliminary report is to describe the surgical technique, results, and complications of a VAP system in three dogs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">All procedures were approved by Utrecht University&#8217;s Ethical Committee, as required under Dutch legislation (DEC number 2014.III.12.112) and performed at the Utrecht University Clinic for Companion Animals. Three research dogs were instrumented with the VAP system and the system was evaluated for a subsequent period of 5 months. After surgical implantation, the VAP system was used for intravenous infusion of liver cells intraoperatively and once daily for 2 days after surgery.

The dogs were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.01&#8201;mg/kg IM (Robinul 0.2&#8201;mg/mL injection, Riemser Pharma GmbH, Greifswald, Deutschland) and methadone 0.5&#8201;mg/kg IV (Comfortan 10&#8201;mg/mL, Dechra, Bladel, The Netherlands). Propofol 1&#8211;4&#8201;mg/kg dosed to effect IV (Propofol 1%, MC Fresenius Kabi, Zeist, The Netherlands) was used for induction.

A clinical examination including abdominal circumference and central venous pressure measurements were performed every 4 hrs for 3 days. Mean arterial pressure was monitored via an intra-arterial line for at least 24&#8201;h postoperatively. Venous blood analysis was performed pre-operatively, and 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-operatively. Blood was sampled through the jugular catheter for the first three postoperative days and at later time points by venipuncture and was analysed for the following parameters: haematocrit, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, total protein and albumin. Dogs received postoperative pain medication, initially consisting of fentanyl 3&#8211;5&#8201;&#956;g/kg/h CRI (Fentanyl, Bipharma, Almere, The Netherlands) and ketamine 3&#8211;5&#8201;&#956;g/kg/min CRI (Narketan, Vetoquinol, &#8216;s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) to effect.

As part of the liver cell transplantation protocol, dogs received cyclosporine 6.25&#8201;mg/kg two times daily per os (Sporimune, AST Farma, Oudewater, The Netherlands) from the day before surgery until 3 months post-operatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Surgery</title><p id="Par14">First, the implantation of the VAP system was practiced on two fresh cadavers of female mixed breed dogs (28&#8201;kg), euthanized for non-related medical experiments (surplus material, Utrecht University 3R-policy). The surgical protocol was then applied to the three experimental dogs. All surgeries were performed by the same surgeons. A midline celiotomy was performed in dorsal recumbency and the falciform ligament was removed after cranial ligation. A left lateral hepatic lobectomy was performed as part of the liver cell transplantation study using double ligation of the large vessels near the hilus of the lobe with polydioxanone (PDS 0, Johnson &amp; Johnson International, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) and additional electrocoagulation to seal the parenchyma peripheral to the ligated vessels.</p><p id="Par15">The VAP system used was a PORT-A-CATH II POWER system (reference number: 21&#8211;4477-24, Smiths Medical Nederland B.V., Rosmalen, The Netherlands) that consisted of a polyurethane catheter with an outer diameter of 1.9&#8201;mm (5.8 Fr), a titanium connector and a single lumen portal made of polysulfone and titanium. The priming volume was provided by the manufacturer and manually confirmed pre-operatively. The volume amount of the catheter + portal&#8201;=&#8201;0.7&#8201;+&#8201;0.3&#8201;ml&#8201;=&#8201;1&#8201;ml. This is the total amount needed to fill a non-adjusted device. The VAP system was prepared and flushed with heparinized saline (50&#8201;IU/mL). A distal branch of the extrahepatic portal circulation (jejunal or splenic vein) was selected based on accessibility and size (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two polyglecaprone 25 (Monocryl 4&#8211;0, Johnson &amp; Johnson International, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) stay-sutures and a Rummel tourniquet (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, left) were placed around the vessel to fixate the vessel and to prevent bleeding. A stab incision was made between both sutures and elongated to approximately 5&#8201;mm over the length of the vein. With the aid of a vein hook (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, middle) the rounded tip of the VAP catheter was inserted into the vein and carefully fed towards the main stem of the extrahepatic portal vein, just one to two centimetres proximal to the hepatic entrance. The position was checked by palpation and the VAP catheter was fixed at the insertion site using a Chinese finger trap suture technique with polypropylene (Prolene 4&#8211;0, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, right). The tourniquet was removed and the preplaced stay-sutures, one distal and one proximal to the catheter insertion, were tied.

A stab incision was made in the abdominal wall and the extravenous part of the catheter was inserted through the incision and connected to the portal outside the abdomen. The portal was fixated to the muscular fascia with three polypropylene (Prolene 2&#8211;0, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) interrupted sutures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The VAP system was flushed again to confirm patency and the subcutaneous pocket was closed with single interrupted polyglecaprone 25 sutures. A 19G gripper needle (reference number: 21&#8211;3280-24, Smiths Medical Nederland B.V., Rosmalen, The Netherlands) was placed percutaneously into the port to obtain venous access for the liver cell infusions and to enable portal venous pressure measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

Images of the portal vein and the tip of the catheter were obtained by B-mode imaging and colour Doppler was applied to check for hepatopetal flow during infusion. The gripper needle was removed 5 days after surgery.</p><p id="Par19">Subsequently, patency was checked by flushing the VAP system once a month. The skin overlying the portal was clipped, locally anesthetized with a combined lidocaine and prilocaine ointment EMLA Cream 5% (AstraZeneca, Den Haag, The Netherlands) and routinely disinfected. A 19G gripper needle (reference number: 21&#8211;3468-24, Smiths Medical Nederland B.V) was inserted percutaneously into the subcutaneous portal. Using a syringe, 5&#8201;ml of blood was withdrawn and the catheter was subsequently flushed with 10&#8201;ml of saline. Patency of the portal vein and the position of the intravenous catheter were also checked with abdominal ultrasonography.

This did not result in any adverse clinical signs. In dog no. 1 routine ultrasonographic evaluation 2 months after placement showed the catheter tip to be dislocated from the proximal position in the portal vein. The exact location of the VAP catheter was determined with additional abdominal radiographs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a,b) and computed tomography (PhilipsSecura, single-slice helical CT scanner; Philips NV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The catheter was lying free within the abdominal cavity. In dogs no. 2 and 3 the catheter became dysfunctional four and 1 month after placement, respectively, because of an obstruction due to thrombus formation at the tip of the catheter, extending into the lumen of the portal vein (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

The VAP system was successfully used for administration of cell suspensions in the portal vein and blood sampling from the portal vein for a minimum period of 1 month after placement. It was demonstrated that also direct portal blood pressure measurements during surgery are possible with the use of the VAP system, and the results are within the reported physiological range for dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In contrast to percutaneous venous catheters, VAP systems have a subcutaneous portal access that offers better protection against external trauma, such as auto-mutilation, and contamination. Their potential durability enables continuous intravenous access for a longer time period, both for clinical and research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study demonstrates their effectiveness in obtaining easy and long term access to parts of the cardiovascular system that are out of reach of percutaneous catheters. Therefore, VAP systems could be useful in a wide range of clinical and research applications in dogs such as prolonged or frequent intravenous administration of therapeutics, blood pressure measurements or blood sampling.</p><p id="Par27">For access to the portal venous system both the use of a jejunal vein and a splenic vein as insertion site for the VAP catheter have been advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The use of a five to seven French diameter catheter has been suggested in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The 5.8 French diameter catheter that was used in this study still appeared too large for insertion in a jejunal vein in two medium sized dogs. However, a splenic vein offered a good alternative for catheter insertion when the jejunal veins were too small.</p><p id="Par28">Postoperatively, haemoabdomen was a serious complication in dog no.1 and no.2. In both dogs no signs of a local bleeding were observed due to ineffective ligation of large hepatic vessels and both showed coagulopathy shortly after surgery (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Retrospective evaluation of the procedures noticed an extensive use of heparin in both dogs: heparinised sodium chloride 0.9% with a concentration of heparin of 50&#8201;IU/ml was used to flush the IV catheters (VAP system, peripheral and central venous catheters) very often. The exact amounts of administered heparin were not documented but overuse could have iatrogenically caused a hypocoagulable state. Therefore in dog no. 3 the heparin concentration in saline used to flush all catheters per-operatively was reduced from 50 to 10&#8201;IU/ml and flushing volumes were minimized. No postoperative coagulopathy or other complications were noticed in dog no. 3.</p><p id="Par29">Infection of the VAP system is one of the most common complications in human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Monthly microbial cultures of specimens from the port revealed a rate of one infection per 200 catheter days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study no microbial cultures were performed, but no clinical signs indicating infection (e.g. fever, leucocytosis) were encountered in our dogs. In future applications, microbial cultures could be useful to detect early (subclinical) infections.</p><p id="Par30">Dislocation of the catheter or port has been described as a complication in both veterinary and human use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In dog no. 1 the catheter was dislocated from the prolene suture, which was still intact. It is unclear why the suture did not hold in this dog, but dislocation of the catheter may have been related to the suture technique, the thermoplastic nature of the polyurethane catheter or motility of the intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The fact that the catheters positioned in the splenic vein did not dislocate supports the causative role of intestinal motility on the dislocation. For future VAP use in the portal system in dogs we would therefore recommend a splenic vein as first choice insertion site.</p><p id="Par31">Although no adverse clinical signs developed by the thrombosis at the tip of two VAP catheters, deep venous thrombosis of the portal vein with complete intraluminal obstruction can lead to portal hypertension and hepatic embolization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Conceivably, we noticed the complication early in its development before portal hypertension could occur. Few cases of VAP system-associated venous thrombosis have been reported in veterinary medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In an experimental study with a VAP system in the portal system no thrombosis of the portal vein was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Differences between studies in the occurrence of thrombi may be explained by differences in species, the applied VAP system, its vascular location, the applied (chemo)therapeutics, time span and catheter maintenance procedures. In this study the maintenance recommendations of the manufacturer were followed: a monthly catheter flush with 5&#8201;mL of heparinized (100&#8201;IU/mL) normal saline. Instead, in the study without reported thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] the system was flushed weekly with normal saline (3&#8201;mL) followed by a heparin lock of 1&#8201;mL of heparinized (1000&#8201;IU/mL) saline. More research is needed to specify whether more frequent flushing and/or increased heparin concentrations are most effective in decreasing catheter-associated thrombosis in canine VAP applications.</p><p id="Par32">In our study, the presence of thrombi in the main stem of the portal vein of two dogs urged the premature removal of the VAP system. In human medicine, catheter removal because of thrombus formation is only considered if anticoagulation therapy fails or is contraindicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Because of missing evidence supporting successful use of thrombolytics in canine venous thrombosis and potential risk of inducing bleeding tendencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], it was decided to remove the VAP systems. Thrombectomy during celiotomy for removal of the VAP system was considered too risky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. After removal of the VAP system the dogs had an uneventful recovery. Further research is necessary to determine the optimal maintenance regime to prevent catheter-associated thrombosis in VAP systems in the canine portal vein.</p><p id="Par33">Although the number of dogs in our study was limited, the results of this study could benefit other veterinary clinicians and researchers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">This pilot study demonstrates that a VAP system can be effectively applied in dogs to obtain long term access to the portal venous system for venous pressure measurements, repeated infusions, and blood sampling.
