Recurrent UPEC infections are a major concern in the treatment and management of UTIs in both species. In humans, the ability of UPECs to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within urothelial cells has been implicated in recurrent UTIs. However, the role of IBCs has not been explored in the pathogenesis of canine recurrent UTIs. In this study, we identified IBCs in both urine and bladder tissue from dogs with UPEC associated UTIs. In addition, we showed that UPECs derived from canine UTIs form IBCs within primary canine urothelial cells. As in human UTIs, formation of IBCs by canine UPECs correlated with the presence of the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene as those isolates lacking the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene formed fewer IBCs in canine urothelial cells then those harboring the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene. Additionally, UPEC strains from clinical cases classified as recurrent UTIs had higher rates of IBC formation than UPEC strains from non-recurrent UTIs. These IBCs were tolerant to treatment with enrofloxacin, cefpodoxime and doxycycline at 150, 50 and 50 &#956;g/mL respectively, which are representative of the concentrations achieved in canine urine after standard dosing. This is consistent with the clinical perspective that current UTIs are a common condition of dogs and are difficult to manage through antimicrobial treatment. Additionally, the dog could prove to be a powerful model of IBC formation as they are natural models of UPEC-causing UTIs and have similar pathophysiology of IBC formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its supplementary figures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its supplementary figures.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common bacterial infections of dogs accounting for 14% of medical cases. Uropathogenic <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) are the most common etiological agents in both human and canine UTIs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recurrent infections are a major concern in the treatment and management of UTIs of both species [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Previous reports show that 20% of dogs with UTIs will develop a recurrent infection with the same uropathogen, despite antimicrobial therapy, within 6-months of the original infection [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In humans, recurrent UTIs are associated with the ability of UPEC to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) that are tolerant to antimicrobial therapy [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, the role of IBCs in canine UTIs has not been demonstrated.</p><p>There has been an increasing interest in the relationship between UPEC biofilm potential and infection persistence in recurrent UTIs; however, a previous study from our group was unable to identify associations between traditional biofilm formation <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and clinical recurrence of UTI in dogs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The traditional definition of a biofilm is a community of bacteria within a polymeric matrix that is attached to an abiotic or biotic surface [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, recent advancements in biofilm research suggest that, in the urinary tract, IBCs are considered non-surface attached, intracellular biofilms [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In human isolates, the ability of UPEC to adhere to and invade the urothelium to form IBCs is facilitated by the type 1 pilus-associated adhesin FimH [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The majority of UPECs encode the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene, a part of the <italic toggle="yes">fim</italic> operon, which is transcribed to the FimH adhesion protein [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. FimH binds to mannose-containing glycoprotein receptors on host cell membranes, which in the urinary tract, are the mannosylated residues on uroplakin proteins that line the apical surface of urothelial cells in the bladder [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. UPEC utilize binding of FimH to the uroplakin receptor complex to enable adhesion to the urothelial surface [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subsequently, the binding of FimH to uroplakin triggers host cell signaling promoting bacterial internalization [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thereafter, UPEC grow and divide intracellularly forming small clusters of bacteria termed IBCs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Once an IBC develops, UPEC are protected, able to tolerate the -cidal activity of many antimicrobials [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Dogs are an ideal translational model for urinary tract infection research as their size allows for repeated access to large volumes of urine [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and biopsies of bladder tissue can be easily accomplished via uroscopy. In addition, dogs are commonly used as models of human disease and are great pharmacokinetic models for novel therapeutics [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also, dogs have similar UTI epidemiology and have urinary biology comparable to humans [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For UPEC specific UTIs, dogs are infected by similar sequence types (STs), have similar rates of multi-drug resistant strains, and canine <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> isolates have shown similar virulence traits and biofilm phenotypes as human isolates [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it is currently unknown if canine UTIs have a similar pathogenesis to human UTIs. More specifically if IBCs are part of UTI pathogenesis in canines.</p><p>Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if dogs demonstrate similar UPEC associated UTI pathogenesis predominated by IBC formation as observed in humans and murine models [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Through retrospective data analysis, we demonstrated that dogs are clinically afflicted by similar uropathogens with similar resistance rates and recurrent infection frequencies as human UTIs. In clinical specimens, we demonstrated that UPEC-causing UTIs were associated with IBCs on both urine cytologies and bladder biopsies in symptomatic dogs; additionally, we validated an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> IBC model using primary canine urothelial cells.

UPEC account for &gt;75% of human UTIs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found that UPEC accounted for 40% of canine urinary tract infections in our retrospective analysis. Although UPEC prevalence was lower, UPEC is still the most frequent uropathogen causing UTIs in dogs. Recurrent infections are a major concern during the treatment and management of UTIs in both dogs and humans [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] We found a slightly higher recurrence rate of 42% in dogs when compared to huams [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which may be due to the case selection: all cases were from a referral hospital and not a primary care clinic. UPEC account for most human recurrent infections associated with the same UPEC strain in &gt;65% of human recurrent UTIs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Similarly, in dogs we found that UPEC accounted for the majority (52%) of recurrent cases. In recent studies, multi-drug resistant UPEC strains are identified in &gt;60% of human isolates [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We found that 45% of canine UPEC isolates were resistance to at least 3 classes of antimicrobials. In addition, extended spectrum beta-lactamase production (ESBL) has been identified in &gt;30% of human UPEC isolates [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In our canine population, we observed 33% of canine UPEC isolates harboring one or more beta-lactamase or ESBL-associated genes.</p><p>In both human and murine UTI studies, the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within the urothelium is a key attribute of UPEC pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. UPEC readily attach, invade, and colonize urinary epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and this ability is often implicated in recurrent UTIs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A study in mice showed UPEC persisting within the bladder epithelium and causing recurrence in one third of the mice [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A publication from Rosen et al. 2007 was the first to show IBCs within sloughed urothelial cells from urine of women with UTI symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In that study, 1 out of 5 urine samples had evidence of IBCs and filamentous bacteria in 50% of the urine samples. We found evidence of IBC formation and filamentous bacteria in 60% and 77% of urine cytologies from UPEC-associated UTIs, respectively. We speculate that the higher rates of IBCs and filamentous bacteria observed in our canine study was because we only evaluated dogs with a positive UPEC culture while Rosen et al., 2007 evaluated UTIs caused by a variety of uropathogens. Other uropathogens such as <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Proteus mirabilis</italic> can also form IBCs, but no evidence of IBC formation in gram-positive species has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We also found evidence of IBCs within the urothelium of the bladder of dogs with a positive UPEC culture and UTI symptoms. These IBCs were similar in structure and appearance to the IBCs seen within murine urothelium during experimental UPEC infection [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Others have shown that human primary urothelial cells, human urothelial cells lines and bladder-on-chip models are able to support IBC formation by UPECs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that canine urothelial cells might be able to support IBC formation as well. Indeed, we demonstrated that most UPEC isolates were able to form IBCs in our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> canine urothelial cell model. These results correlate well with a murine study showing that most human derived UPECs could form IBCs in a murine <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> UTI model [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>The ability of UPEC to adhere to and invade into the urothelium to form IBCs is facilitated by the type 1 pilus-associated adhesin FimH, a protein encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene, and which binds to mannosylated uroplakin-proteins that line the apical surface of urothelial cells in the bladder, triggering bacterial internalization about 3-hours post-infection [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Other studies in mice have shown that UPEC lacking the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene are unable to form IBCs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the ability of canine derived UPEC harboring or lacking the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene to from IBCs in our canine urothelial cell model. We found that UPEC isolates lacking the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene formed fewer IBCs than those isolates with harboring the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene. However, in those UPEC isolates harboring the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene we observed a range of IBCs from rare to robust.</p><p>We also found that UPECs isolated from recurrent UTI cases formed more IBCs then those UPEC isolates from non-recurrent cases. Other studies have shown that certain SNPs within the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene can results in a gain or loss of function in binding to urothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. If UPEC are unable to bind to the urothelial cell, they are subsequently unable to invade into the cell to form IBCs. Therefore, we hypothesize that this variation and association with recurrence could be due to the FimH type or SNPs within the <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> gene resulting from pathoadaptation to the urinary environment which will be a line of inquiry for future work.</p><p>UPEC within IBCs are protected from killing by antimicrobials [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This protection arises from both decreased penetration of the antimicrobial into the bacterial community within the urothelial cell and the reduced metabolic state of bacteria within the IBC [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. We infected canine urothelial cells with UPEC strains know to form robust IBCs from previous screening for 24 hours prior to treatment with a variety of antimicrobials from different drug classes used to treat canine UTIs [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]; specifically, the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin, the cephalosporin cefpodoxime, and the tetracycline doxycycline. We challenged the UPEC-infected urothelial cells with concentrations achievable in canine urine after standard dosing of each antimicrobial [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. None of the antimicrobials at clinically relevant concentrations were able to reduce the number of IBCs or the bacterial load greater than 2-log; although some variability was observed in response, this is likely due to intracellularly achievable concentration differences between antimicrobial classes. Our outcomes are supported by several studies showing that IBCs are tolerant to antimicrobial treatment [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For example, in a murine bladder infection model treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not eradicate bacteria within the bladder [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study showed persistence of UPEC within the bladder epithelium using multiple antibiotics with urine concentration well above the therapeutic threshold of planktonic (single cell) UPEC [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a bladder on chip model, treatment with a beta-lactam, ampicillin, did not reduce the IBC size or distribution within the tissue [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These findings correlate with the clinical observations that approximately 14% of women require a second antibiotic prescription within 28 days of diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the dog is a robust translational model for human UTIs. A recent review article calls for the development of new animal models that better recapitulate human disease [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. As the dog is a naturally occurring model of UPEC UTIs it holds promise as a more clinically relevant model then the induced murine or porcine models currently in use [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The results of this study show that the pathogenesis of canine UPEC UTIs, with the formation of antimicrobial tolerant <italic toggle="yes">fimH</italic> dependent IBCs, are similar to human UTIs caused by UPECs. Importantly, the use of the dog would serve as a One Health model as results from these studies could directly apply to both human and veterinary medicine. However, future work is needed that expands upon the presented in this manuscript into an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experimental model that can be used to study pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutics. In addition, direct genomic comparisons of canine and human UPECs could be useful in further assessing the canine UTI model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>Clinical UPEC isolates (n = 206) were obtained from routine clinical aerobic cultures of canine urine submitted to the North Carolina State University&#8217;s College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM), Microbiology and Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory (Raleigh, NC).

The dogs were euthanized by the local animal control facility based on unfit temperament for adoption at the discretion of the facility; the authors had no role in the decision to euthanize and were notified of the planned euthanasia prior to attending. No dogs were euthanized for the purpose of this study. Dogs were apparently healthy, in good body condition and did not show any signs of urinary or renal disease. At the time of collection, the distal abdomen was aseptically prepped, and a surgical incision was made to reach the urinary bladder. A urine sample was collected for culture after surgical incision by cystocentesis prior to removing the bladder. The bladder was removed by severing of the ureters and ligaments and excising the bladder at the neck before placing the bladder in PBS containing antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco&#174; Antibiotic-Antimycotic ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Bladders were transported to the laboratory on ice and all subsequent work was completed in a biosafety cabinet. The bladder was turned inside out to expose the mucosa. Mucosa was evaluated for any noticeable gross pathology. If a bladder had a positive urine culture or the mucosa appeared grossly abnormal, the bladder or any isolated cells were excluded from further use. The mucosa neck of the bladder was sutured closed to ensure only mucosa was exposed. The tissue was then suspended in an Erlenmeyer flask in HBSS containing antibiotic-antimycotic and 2.4U/mL Gibco&#174; Dispase II (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and incubated for 2 hours at 5% CO2, 90% humidity, and 37&#176;C under constant rotation (<xref rid="pone.0316834.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). After 2 hours, any remaining tissue on the mucosal surface was gently scraped off and added to the dispersed cells, passed through a 100&#956;m filter, and centrifuged at 300g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in fresh HBSS and a live cell count was determined using a Cellometer&#174; Auto 2000 and ViaStainTM AOPI Staining Solution (Nexcelom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA).

Dead or non-adherent cells were removed the next day by washing with warm PBS three times and adding fresh UCPM. The culture medium was changed every 48 hours for 5&#8211;7 days. UCPM is a serum-free media and was used to proliferate urothelial cells while decreasing fibroblast contamination; by the end of 5&#8211;7 days, depending on the donor, a pure urothelial cell culture was appreciated by brightfield microscopy and analysis of cellular morphology as described by others (<xref rid="pone.0316834.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].

First, the intracellular bacterial load was assessed in each culture by lysing urothelial cells and performing serial dilutions and plate counting to determine intracellular CFU [<xref rid="pone.0316834.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Second, we visualized and quantified IBCs by immunofluorescence. Briefly, after infection and/or treatment, cultures were washed five times with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Cultures were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% BSA prior to staining with Rabbit Anti-<italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> FITC (1:100, ab30522, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and Alexa Fluor&#8482; 555 Phalloidin according to manufacturer&#8217;s directions (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Nuclei were stained with DAPI Fluoromount-G&#174; (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) prior to imaging on an Olympus IX73 inverted scope with DP80 camera using appropriate fluorescent channels (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). To quantify the number of IBCs by visualization, the average number of IBCs observed per high powered field (HPF) were counted; five HPFs at 10x magnification were counted per well. A secondary quantification method was performed to determine the intracellular bacterial load. Using this method, urothelial cell monolayers were washed 3x with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X for 10 minutes. After lysis, serial dilutions were performed, and spot plated in triplicate at each serial dilution for colony counts.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data in graphs is presented as bars representing the mean and standard deviations. Data was analyzed for normality by the Shapiro&#8208;Wilk test. Based on normality, single data points such as IBCs/HPF and log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL were analyzed by either a 1-way non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis Test) or unpaired t-test. A 2-way ANOVA with Tukey&#8217;s post hoc test was used to analyze the antimicrobial effects on IBCs. Frequencies were evaluated by a chi-square test. Sex and other covariates were included as fixed effects in the model if indicated. Analysis was performed using JMP Pro 11.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla California USA). For all comparisons, p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0316834.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Canine urothelial cell isolation and differentiation.</title><p>Canine bladders (n = 10) were aseptically collected postmortem from apparently healthy dogs after planned euthanasia by an animal control facility.

Several suggestions for improvement are given below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. The Introduction could do a better job of specifying what is and what is not known about canine UTI prior to the present study. In the passage starting on line 69, the authors state that &#8220;dogs have similar UTI pathogenesis&#8221; to humans and that dogs have similar rates of drug-resistant uropathogens, giving multiple references for these statements. Then, in the subsequent paragraph, the authors state that the goal of the present study was to &#8220;determine if dogs demonstrate similar UTI pathogenesis&#8221; to humans, and that the present paper &#8220;demonstrated that dogs are clinically affected by similar uropathogens with similar resistance rates&#8230;&#8221; On a related note, the authors state (line 70) that dogs have &#8220;urinary biology comparable to humans&#8221; but this statement needs more specifics. What aspects of urinary biology are similar between the two species?</p><p>2. The letter-labels for the panels in Figure 1 don&#8217;t match between the legend (lines 116-128) and the figure itself.</p><p>3. In the paragraph starting on line 250, it appears that 12 recurrent UTI strains and 12 non-recurrent strains were evaluated. But then &#8220;97.5%&#8221; and &#8220;84.9%&#8221; of the strains carry fimH, which presumably reflects n=206 (Figure S2 legend)? The text in this paragraph should be clarified as to how many strains were evaluated for each analysis.</p><p>4. In Figure 7, it isn&#8217;t clear what is meant by &#8220;significant differences are indicated by differing letters&#8221; &#8211; in other words, what the a&#8217;s and b&#8217;s mean in panels A and B. Accompanying this, it would be helpful if in the Discussion, the authors commented on these differences and how they might correlate with the likely intracellular penetration of the chosen antibiotics. Specifically, fluoroquinolones (e.g., enrofloxacin) and doxycycline would be expected to penetrate cells better than a beta-lactam (here cefpodoxime), and there appears to be a correlation between this property and the antibacterial effect as measured by CFU and IBC numbers.</p><p>5. In Figure S2, the measurements of both fimH carriage (panel A) and MDR (panel B) are binary in nature. So, what do the bars represent here? There should not be standard deviations in this type of data. Accompanying that, one would expect that a chi-square analysis rather than &#8220;an unpaired, nonparametric t-test&#8221; (line 279) would be appropriate for comparisons.</p><p>6. The vertebrate animals information would benefit from additional clarification. The authors state that all the samples were collected for clinical purposes and prior to the start of any analysis (i.e., they were banked). What was the clinical indication for bladder biopsies in dogs with active UTIs?</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1. Given that no methodologic details are not fully available in the abstract, one should remove the specific numerical data from the abstract. For example, &#8220;4.2 log10 CFU/well&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have specific meaning as the reader hasn&#8217;t yet read the methods.</p><p>2. Line 44: &#8220;20% of dogs with UTIs will develop a recurrent infection&#8230;&#8221; during what period of follow-up (in reference 4)?</p><p>3. Line 182: Beyond &#8220;similar morphology,&#8221; can the authors be more specific as to the size of intracellular communities or the apparent number of bacteria, in canine uroepithelial cells vs the immortalized human bladder cell line?</p><p>4. Some of the figure legends could be shortened by reducing methodologic detail (these details already appear in the Methods section).</p><p>5. The Discussion could probably also be shortened by reducing the degree to which the current Results are recapped.</p><p>6. Panels A and B of Figure 2 could probably be eliminated, as they reflect simple percentages that are described in the text.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The authors have written an informative manuscript.

</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their time and thoughtful suggestions on improving this manuscript. There are detailed responses to each concern noted. </p><p>Reviewer #1: In this paper, Gilbertie and colleagues describe a series of experiments identifying intracellular uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in the urothelial tissues of dogs with UTIs, as well as the capability of canine uroepithelial cells to be propagated and to support an intracellular, IBC-like state for UPEC. Several suggestions for improvement are given below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. The Introduction could do a better job of specifying what is and what is not known about canine UTI prior to the present study. In the passage starting on line 69, the authors state that &#8220;dogs have similar UTI pathogenesis&#8221; to humans and that dogs have similar rates of drug-resistant uropathogens, giving multiple references for these statements. Then, in the subsequent paragraph, the authors state that the goal of the present study was to &#8220;determine if dogs demonstrate similar UTI pathogenesis&#8221; to humans, and that the present paper &#8220;demonstrated that dogs are clinically affected by similar uropathogens with similar resistance rates&#8230;&#8221; On a related note, the authors state (line 70) that dogs have &#8220;urinary biology comparable to humans&#8221; but this statement needs more specifics. What aspects of urinary biology are similar between the two species?</p><p>We agree that the introduction was confusing, and we appreciate the reviewers point. We have edited the introduction to state that we know dogs have similar UTI epidemiology in that they are infected with similar etiologic agents, are infected by similar UPEC sequence types, have similar MDR and ESBL carriage within their UPEC population and are afflicted by similar recurrence rates. However, if canine and human UTIs have a similar pathogenesis is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this manuscript was to determine if IBCs form in canine UTIs in a similar manner as observed in humans.</p><p>2. The letter-labels for the panels in Figure 1 don&#8217;t match between the legend (lines 116-128) and the figure itself.</p><p>Thank you for noting this mistake. This has now been corrected.</p><p>3. In the paragraph starting on line 250, it appears that 12 recurrent UTI strains and 12 non-recurrent strains were evaluated. But then &#8220;97.5%&#8221; and &#8220;84.9%&#8221; of the strains carry fimH, which presumably reflects n=206 (Figure S2 legend)? The text in this paragraph should be clarified as to how many strains were evaluated for each analysis.</p><p>We edited this experimental description for clarity. </p><p>4. In Figure 7, it isn&#8217;t clear what is meant by &#8220;significant differences are indicated by differing letters&#8221; &#8211; in other words, what the a&#8217;s and b&#8217;s mean in panels A and B. </p><p>Letter designations are given when using a Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons. Therefore, a bar with an &#8220;a&#8221; above it is statistically different from a bar with any other letter designations such as &#8220;b&#8221; or &#8220;c&#8221; but it not different from another &#8220;a&#8221; or a bar with an &#8220;a,b&#8221; above it. We tried to clarify that in the figure legend more.</p><p>Accompanying this, it would be helpful if in the Discussion, the authors commented on these differences and how they might correlate with the likely intracellular penetration of the chosen antibiotics. Specifically, fluoroquinolones (e.g., enrofloxacin) and doxycycline would be expected to penetrate cells better than a beta-lactam (here cefpodoxime), and there appears to be a correlation between this property and the antibacterial effect as measured by CFU and IBC numbers.</p><p>Good point! We have added this observation to the discussion section; in the interest of discussion length as previously noted by reviewers, we did not go into detail as it was not the primary outcome of interest; we can certainly develop this further if the reviewer feels like it would be important. </p><p>5. In Figure S2, the measurements of both fimH carriage (panel A) and MDR (panel B) are binary in nature. So, what do the bars represent here? There should not be standard deviations in this type of data. Accompanying that, one would expect that a chi-square analysis rather than &#8220;an unpaired, nonparametric t-test&#8221; (line 279) would be appropriate for comparisons.</p><p>We removed the error bars and performed a chi-square test instead of a t-test. The figure has been updated to represent the edits.</p><p>6. The vertebrate animals information would benefit from additional clarification. The authors state that all the samples were collected for clinical purposes and prior to the start of any analysis (i.e., they were banked). What was the clinical indication for bladder biopsies in dogs with active UTIs?</p><p>Bladder biopsies are taken during uroscopy at the discretion of the treating veterinarian. The biopsies are sent to the pathology service to evaluate the bladder tissue for the presence of inflammation, infection, or neoplasm. These samples are banked and can be used for research purposes. We have tried to clarify this in the manuscript by adding that these are diagnostic specimens submitted for the management of a patient and not because of inclusion in the study. Still, all samples submitted to the NCSU CVM are approved to be used for research purposes. </p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1. Given that no methodologic details are not fully available in the abstract, one should remove the specific numerical data from the abstract. For example, &#8220;4.2 log10 CFU/well&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have specific meaning as the reader hasn&#8217;t yet read the methods.</p><p>This numerical data has been removed from the abstract per this reviewer&#8217;s request.</p><p>2. Line 44: &#8220;20% of dogs with UTIs will develop a recurrent infection&#8230;&#8221; during what period of follow-up (in reference 4)?</p><p>This has been updated.</p><p>3. Line 182: Beyond &#8220;similar morphology,&#8221; can the authors be more specific as to the size of intracellular communities or the apparent number of bacteria, in canine uroepithelial cells vs the immortalized human bladder cell line?</p><p>Not at this stage but this would be a good idea for future work.</p><p>4. Some of the figure legends could be shortened by reducing methodologic detail (these details already appear in the Methods section).</p><p>We have followed this suggestion and reduced the figure legends.</p><p>5. The Discussion could probably also be shortened by reducing the degree to which the current Results are recapped.</p><p>We have followed this advice and removed paragraph 1 that recapped the results.</p><p>6.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;All comments addressed</p><p>This field requires 100 character minimum, so I am adding this sentence to reach that goal</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Dear Author</p><p>Thank you for your manuscript submission. I believe that your study has fundamental problem. As you know, E.coli has a powerful arsenal including a wide range of virulence factors. You can not draw a conclusion on the basis of a virulence factor like FimH or other virulence factor in solo regarding a feature like IBC. There are many paradox in your manuscript which each part deny the other. Hence, my decision regarding the present manuscript is Definite Rejection.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#160;The only concern that has no been addressed is related with the microscope technique selected for visualization and quantification of IBC. Epifluorescence do not allow to differentiate if a bacteria is on the surface of the cell or inside because of the type of images it gave. In this cases, confocal microscopy is the best option as it is possible to take optical images in the z-plane. Confocal microscopy will confirm that the bacteria are really inside the cell and not in the surface.</p><p>Reviewer #5:&#160;Article is written in standard English.</p><p>Article is acceptable in this form.</p><p>All reviewers comments had been addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #6:&#160;Please ensure the manuscript is submitted as per guidelines of the journal. This is interesting study, and hard work has been done to provide ne information, but there is significantly change needed to write in research manuscript format. Specific comments are provided in the manuscript. The author has made change as requested from previous review. However, the manuscript is not up to the standard of journal. The method section has all previous work description, and some current work description. Result section has method and discussion.</p><p>The ANOVA analysis performed, and did not mention the result. For what section did you performed ANOVA? Please elaborate. The figure still needs clear caption. Results for each experiment conducted in this study would added value in terms of data sharing as there are only 9 sample size. Figure with IBCs and bar graph do not provide enough data to researcher who want to replicate the study in future.</p><p>Reviewer #7:&#160;Authors have performed a detailed study and manuscript is well written.</p><p>Authors have written in the Ethics statement that IACUC approval was not required. I think this statement should be revisited.</p><p>Reviewer #8:&#160;This study is aimed to investigate whether dogs evidence similar UPEC-associated UTI pathogenesis with IBC formation, and to validate an in vitro IBC model using primary canine urothelial cells.</p><p>The work overall is solid, although I do have some comments (noted below).</p><p>Comments</p><p>- In all figures, font types are unreadable, please modify. Similar problems arise with the scale bar in most of the micrographs.</p><p>- Information regarding the retrospective study performed should be added in Materials and Methods Section, including its ethical approval.</p><p>- L334. Data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility should be shown.</p><p>- Authors should proofread the manuscript and correct some minor spelling mistakes.</p><p>Reviewer #9:&#160;The authors described the capability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, isolated from canine UTIs, to invade bladder cells and to form the intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). This represents a very interesting topic for microbiologists characterizing UPEC strains and the paper provides a basis to study the genotypic and phenotypic relationship between human and dog associated UPEC. Images of IBCs are solid and results reported in the manuscript are quite in line with the published data. However, authors should address the following points:</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Introduction section should be improved</p><p>Lines 44-47 Is there any genetic/phylogenetic relationship among human- and dog-associated UPEC? Can the author describe this point in the introduction?</p><p>Lines 49-51 Can the authors explain the mechanism through which the biofilm is associated to recurrent infections?</p><p>Lines 52-54 To be precise, IBCs are bacterial communities with biofilm-like properties. Moreover, the capability to form IBCs depends mainly on the ability of bacteria to be internalized within a eukaryotic cell rather than their biofilm forming activity. Please, rephrase the paragraph.</p><p>Lines 63-64 What did the authors mean for antimicrobials? Also molecules from innate immunity?</p><p>Lines 71-73 See comment above about the genetic/phylogenetic relationship among human- and dog-associated UPEC?</p><p>Lines 76-77 What did the authors mean for &#8220;similar uropathogens&#8221;?</p><p>Line 79 Please, replace &#8220;cytologies&#8221; with &#8220;cytology&#8221; throughout the text.</p><p>Line 108 Did the authors confirm the phenotypic resistance to beta-lactams?</p><p>Line 277 Ref 23 is not correct. I suggest to replace it with the following: 10.3390/molecules25020316; 10.1186/s12879-018-3467-0.</p><p>Line 335 In my opinion letters are confusing. Please, report statistically significant differences by using asterisks.</p><p>Lines 252-253 This sentence is not correct. There are several papers describing the characteristics of E. coli responsible for recurrent UTIs in humans. Probably the authors refer to those associated with dogs.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Lines 123-125 Did the authors perform real time PCR or PCR? Evaluation of gene expression seems in contrast to the results described in lines 107-108. Can the authors clarify this point? What did the author mean for &#8220;standard screening with the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory for any Escherichia coli&#8221;</p><p>Line 145 Fig. 3 shows huge bacterial communities located beneath the superficial layers of the bladder. Is this right? Usually IBCs are observed within cells at the superficial layer of the epithelium. Can the authors describe this point? I suggest also to insert arrows showing IBCs.</p><p>Line 180 Bars in figure 4 should show the IBC-CFU/ml counting for each tested strains to point out differences among strains. In this form the bars are not understandable. Moreover, negative and positive controls should be added in these type of analyses. A lab E. coli strain can be used as negative control. Vice versa, an already reported IBC producing strain should be used as positive control.</p><p>Line 229 Did these fimH negative strains belong to the 30 analyzed? In line 180 the authors reported 5 strains with no capability to form IBCs. Can the authors clarify the origin of these strains? How did the authors evaluate the absence of fimH gene?</p><p>Lines 260-261 Is this analysis statistically valid? Considering the low number of analyzed isolates anything can be concluded.</p><p>Lines 277-278 FIG S2B is not mentioned in the text and due to the lack of significant results I would suggest the authors to delete totally this analysis.</p><p>Lines 310-317 These results are not very solid. Are the antibiotics tested capable to permeate epithelial cells? If not, no conclusions can be drawn from these experiments. I suggest to use an antibiotic that penetrate the cells to evaluate if bacteria forming IBCs are somehow resistant or not.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Discussion section should be shortened</p><p>Lines 338-340 Please, lower your enthusiasms about the implications of your model. This type of conclusion cannot be drawn based on the reported results.</p><p>Lines 348-349 As stated before, this conclusion cannot be drawn.</p><p>Lines 350-351 As stated before, this conclusion cannot be drawn.</p><p>Line 442 See comment above. Are these antibiotics able to permeate the bladder cells?</p><p>Line 462 With the current knowledge it is very difficult to assign one specific pathotype to an E. coli isolate. So it would be better to increase the number of gene tested to increase the probability of a correct classifications. The list of genes associated with UPEC isolates is reported in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10123-022-00235-y" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10123-022-00235-y</ext-link> and references therein.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Line 335 Please, use only the acronym.</p><p>Line 357 Can the authors compare these rates with published data?</p><p>Lines 408-410 Are there evidences of the presence of other adhesins involved in bacterial internalization?</p><p>Lines 433-434 In my opinion, a model for canine related UTIs is needed to study canine UTIs. Now there are several advanced models based on human cells to evaluate human UTIs.</p><p>Line 437 What is the meaning of one health model? Probably it would be better to highlight the fact that UPEC strains can infect humans and dogs, if this is correct. For example, are there studies describing the relationship among human and canine isolates?</p><p>Reviewer #10:&#160;About the article, I think the authors replied to all comments; therefore, the paper is acceptable, now.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>Reviewer #11:&#160;In this manuscript, Gilbertie et al provide a characterization of the role of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in urinary tract infections in dogs. The authors have addressed several of the concerns of the reviewers from Round 1, but overall, there are still areas where the manuscript can be improved, and the claims clarified. The review was also made very difficult by the fact that there are many versions of the text, including one with comments between the authors still included. It was therefore hard to access which is the final revised text &#8211; the comments below are based on the text with the track changes on. Figure 2 is also missing from the revised manuscript, and Figure S2 is repeated as &#8216;Figure 2 revised&#8217; which is incorrect.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>IBCs vs intracellular bacteria: It is unclear to me how the authors define and identify IBCs. At the first glance, it appears that the manuscript appears to characterize all intracellular growth of UPEC as IBCs, especially in the later figures. IBCs are only a subset of intracellular bacteria and are characterized by a high intracellular load of bacteria in umbrella cells, with many of the bacteria within the IBCs being smaller and of coccoid shape. These sorts of structures are evident in Figure 3, where the authors clearly indicate these structures in Figure 3 so that the reader can appreciate them better. Thereafter, some clarity is needed as to how IBCs were enumerated in the high-power field images, and how the total bacterial load was enumerated. If the authors have treated every instance of intracellular growth as an IBC, then they should use the term intracellular bacteria rather than IBCs, especially for the data in Figures 5 and 6. If not, then pointing out examples of IBCs, especially in the FimH+ samples would help the reader.</p><p>Antibiotic treatment data: Please show the individual points in the bar plots of Figure 7 (as shown in the other figures) to help the reader appreciate the spread in CFU. What do the letters a, b represent in the statistical comparisons &#8211; the Figure legend does not clarify this either. Please provide p values from an ANOVA test corrected for multiple comparisons. There does appear to be quite a significant decrease in the number of IBCs in the treatment with Enro. The authors need to discuss the differences between antibiotics more clearly in the Main Text and Discussion. It is also unclear why an arbitrary 2log threshold is cited in the Main Text as the cutoff for any significant difference in CFU. The duration of antibiotic treatment is also unclear. These methodological points need to be made clear and if a comparison is made to the results in the bladder-on-chip study that the authors reference in the Discussion, then it is important to note that there was some clearance by Ampicillin in that study (but very delayed compared to clearance of lumenal bacteria.</p><p>Minor points</p><p>Recurrent UTIs: the main text should be edited to clarify that these are canine-specific strains.</p><p>Figure 1: Percentage numbers are missing on the figure-1B and 1C.</p><p>Amalgamation of some figures: The manuscript would be improved if the number of main figures were reduced. For example, the low power field images in Figure 4 could be moved to a supplementary, and Figures 5 and 6 could be merged to help the reader identify the clear trend FimH-&lt; FimH+&lt;fimh+ recurrent.=""&gt;</p><p>Use of colours in the figures in the paper: The authors could use non-primary colours to enable colour-blind readers to appreciate the images better. UPEC are identified as labelled green in Figures 3 and 4 when they are in fact shown in yellow.</p><p>Role of other tissue-resident populations in persistent infections: Quiescent intracellular bacteria in the bladder PMID: 16968784 are also thought to contribute to recurrence; similar populations of solitary bacteria were also observed in a recent study with mouse bladder organoids PMID: 34289360. Could the authors comment on whether similar mechanisms might operate in the canine bladder and whether some of the bacteria they observe in the canine tissue might belong to these sub-populations?</p><p>Additional papers on human IBCs in human epithelial cells: At Line 171 or 181 depending on whether track changes are off or on, the authors could cite these relevant papers with UTI work in human cell lines: PMID: 32540870, 29352171 in addition to the study with the PD07i line.</p><p>Comparison with murine models for UTIs in the Discussion: At line 389 or 414 depending on whether track changes is off or on, the authors should also include murine bladder organoids PMID: 34289360 in the discussion, where IBC formation was also shown and visualized by confocal and volumetric electron microscopy.</p><p>Comparison with human models in the Discussion: At lines 390 or 415, the authors should also include references to Transwell models that have been used by several groups PMID: 29352171, 37051302&lt;/fimh+&gt;</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">14 Nov 2023</named-content>
</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their continued support and investment in this manuscript. With 11 reviewers, it is challenging to address all comments, but we have provided a point by point response below and continue to look for ways to improve our work. </p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Thank you for your manuscript submission. I believe that your study has fundamental problem. As you know, E.coli has a powerful arsenal including a wide range of virulence factors. You can not draw a conclusion on the basis of a virulence factor like FimH or other virulence factor in solo regarding a feature like IBC. There are many paradox in your manuscript which each part deny the other. Hence, my decision regarding the present manuscript is Definite Rejection.</p><p>We appreciate your opinion; we never state that FimH is the only gene responsible for IBC formation. We evaluated this gene as it has been shown in other publications in other species to play a vital role in the first step of IBC formation. Therefore, we examined if this gene was important in canine IBC, and we found that it was. As this is in accordance with studies in other mammalian species, it serves to support that IBC pathophysiology is similar in dogs which is the basis of this comparative model. In future studies, we plan to examine additional virulence factors. The goal of this paper, however, is to establish the dog as a relevant UTI model, and additional virulence determination is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>The only concern that has no been addressed is related with the microscope technique selected for visualization and quantification of IBC. Epifluorescence do not allow to differentiate if a bacteria is on the surface of the cell or inside because of the type of images it gave. In this cases, confocal microscopy is the best option as it is possible to take optical images in the z-plane. Confocal microscopy will confirm that the bacteria are really inside the cell and not in the surface.</p><p>Thank you for your concern. We believe we have addressed this possibility in the methods section where we describe using gentamicin to kill any extracellular bacteria starting 1 hr post infection. The gentamicin remains in the media until the end of the experiment. We also wash extensively before imaging to remove dead organisms. </p><p>Reviewer #6 </p><p>Please ensure the manuscript is submitted as per guidelines of the journal. This is interesting study, and hard work has been done to provide ne information, but there is significantly change needed to write in research manuscript format. Specific comments are provided in the manuscript. The author has made change as requested from previous review. However, the manuscript is not up to the standard of journal. The method section has all previous work description, and some current work description. Result section has method and discussion.</p><p>Thank you for your notes on the formatting of the manuscript. We have simplified several of the results section in this version to remove more of the methods. However, we feel that having a brief leading description of the experiment leads to a better understanding of the results we are presenting. We have formatted our sections like this in other manuscripts submitted to PLoS with success. We hope that the edits we have made have addressed this comment appropriately.</p><p>The ANOVA analysis performed, and did not mention the result. For what section did you performed ANOVA? Please elaborate. The figure still needs clear caption. Results for each experiment conducted in this study would added value in terms of data sharing as there are only 9 sample size. </p><p>In the statistical analysis, we state the ANOVA was used to assess the antimicrobial treatments. In that specific figure legend (Fig 7), we state that an ANOVA was used. The results of the ANOVA are presented in the figure as differing letters indicating p&lt;0.05 based on the Tukey post hoc analysis. However, we have removed the letters and instead our now presenting the p-values of the untreated control (NT) against each individual antimicrobial treatment (ENRO, POD, DOX). We hope that this presentation is what the reviewer was looking for.</p><p>Figure with IBCs and bar graph do not provide enough data to researcher who want to replicate the study in future.</p><p>We understand that the bar graphs may not give enough detail for replication. Therefore, we changed the bar graphs to a bar graph with an overlaid scatter plot so individuals can see each individual data point. We hope that aids in the replicability of the data.</p><p>Reviewer #7</p><p>Authors have written in the Ethics statement that IACUC approval was not required. I think this statement should be revisited.</p><p>We have addressed the ethics statement and IACUC need in the manuscript with justification. If additional information is needed, please be specific what is missing so we can be more clear.</p><p>Reviewer #8</p><p>This study is aimed to investigate whether dogs evidence similar UPEC-associated UTI pathogenesis with IBC formation, and to validate an in vitro IBC model using primary canine urothelial cells. The work overall is solid, although I do have some comments (noted below).</p><p>Comments</p><p>- In all figures, font types are unreadable, please modify. Similar problems arise with the scale bar in most of the micrographs. We have edited the figures to increase legibility. </p><p>- Information regarding the retrospective study performed should be added in Materials and Methods Section, including its ethical approval. We have added information regarding the retrospective analysis into the methods</p><p>- L334. Data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility should be shown. We have added the MIC breakpoints to line 334 in replace of &#8220;data not shown&#8221;.</p><p>- Authors should proofread the manuscript and correct some minor spelling mistakes. The manuscript has been re-proofread to catch any spelling mistakes.</p><p>Review #9</p><p>The authors described the capability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, isolated from canine UTIs, to invade bladder cells and to form the intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). This represents a very interesting topic for microbiologists characterizing UPEC strains and the paper provides a basis to study the genotypic and phenotypic relationship between human and dog associated UPEC. Images of IBCs are solid and results reported in the manuscript are quite in line with the published data. However, authors should address the following points:</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Introduction section should be improved. We have updated this section, however, this comment is not particularly specific so if holes are noted please let us know.</p><p>Lines 44-47 Is there any genetic/phylogenetic relationship among human- and dog-associated UPEC? Can the author describe this point in the introduction? The only comparisons that have been performed are presented in paragraph 4. This work is currently being performed in the first author&#8217;s laboratory as a collaboration between a veterinary school and medical school in the same geographic region. We expect that manuscript to follow this one in the next year.</p><p>Lines 49-51 Can the authors explain the mechanism through which the biofilm is associated to recurrent infections? In paragraph 2 we state that had no found a correlation between traditional surface attached biofilms and strains that cause recurrent infections. Therefore, IBCs, which are biofilm-like, may be associated but yet proven.</p><p>Lines 52-54 To be precise, IBCs are bacterial communities with biofilm-like properties. Moreover, the capability to form IBCs depends mainly on the ability of bacteria to be internalized within a eukaryotic cell rather than their biofilm forming activity. Please, rephrase the paragraph. This paragraph has been rephrased.</p><p>Lines 63-64 What did the authors mean for antimicrobials? Also molecules from innate immunity? This has been edited for clarity to mean prescribed antimicrobial agents not naturally derived from the innate immune response.</p><p>Lines 71-73 See comment above about the genetic/phylogenetic relationship among human- and dog-associated UPEC? To date, there is nothing in the literature and this manuscript focuses on IBC pathophysiology. However, this work is currently the focus of a grant in the first authors laboratory.</p><p>Lines 76-77 What did the authors mean for &#8220;similar uropathogens&#8221;? This has been changed to etiologic agents.</p><p>Line 79 Please, replace &#8220;cytologies&#8221; with &#8220;cytology&#8221; throughout the text. As we are referring to multiple not individual we would argue to keep as cytologies, similar to biopsy vs biopsies. </p><p>Line 108 Did the authors confirm the phenotypic resistance to beta-lactams? Yes, this has been rephrased to indicate this.</p><p>Line 277 Ref 23 is not correct. I suggest to replace it with the following: 10.3390/molecules25020316; 10.1186/s12879-018-3467-0. This has been corrected.</p><p>Line 335 In my opinion letters are confusing. Please, report statistically significant differences by using asterisks. This has been changed to astericks.</p><p>Lines 252-253 This sentence is not correct. There are several papers describing the characteristics of E. coli responsible for recurrent UTIs in humans. Probably the authors refer to those associated with dogs. The authors could only find references showing that recurrent strains carry more virulence genes but no specific genes have been associated apart from fimH which we evaluate in this manuscript. In addition, there is controversy over the associated between surface-associated biofilm grown in a microtiter plate correlating with recurrent infections. Which is why the authors propose that IBCs may have a higher association. Nevertheless, we have rephrased this to better explain our literature findings.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Lines 123-125 Did the authors perform real time PCR or PCR? Evaluation of gene expression seems in contrast to the results described in lines 107-108. Can the authors clarify this point? What did the author mean for &#8220;standard screening with the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory for any Escherichia coli&#8221;</p><p>The clinical assessment of virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility as was done when collecting these isolates through clinical canine submissions was performed by conventional PCR. We have corrected the description that inferred real time PCR. </p><p>Line 145 Fig. 3 shows huge bacterial communities located beneath the superficial layers of the bladder. Is this right? Usually IBCs are observed within cells at the superficial layer of the epithelium. Can the authors describe this point? I suggest also to insert arrows showing IBCs.</p><p>The authors note that they did not point out the autofluorescence that hemorrhage within the bladder epithelium causes. Therefore, we have added a note about that in the figure legend and added arrows to denote the IBCs in each image.</p><p>Line 180 Bars in figure 4 should show the IBC-CFU/ml counting for each tested strains to point out differences among strains. In this form the bars are not understandable. Moreover, negative and positive controls should be added in these type of analyses. A lab E. coli strain can be used as negative control. Vice versa, an already reported IBC producing strain should be used as positive control.</p><p>We have changed the bars to scatter plots with bars to aid here. As UTI89 is not a canine strain nor any other published strains, we do not have a positive and negative controls specific for our species. We have robust IBC formation noted by several of our strains in addition to those that form no IBCs at all. Therefore, our screening has identified strains we can use moving forward as positive and negative canine-specific controls.</p><p>Line 229 Did these fimH negative strains belong to the 30 analyzed? In line 180 the authors reported 5 strains with no capability to form IBCs. Can the authors clarify the origin of these strains? How did the authors evaluate the absence of fimH gene?</p><p>Only 3 of the fimH negative strains belonged to the 30 analyzed. We used our repository of 206 to find the other 6. We only had 9 total in all 206. We added this to the text to further clarify.</p><p>Lines 260-261 Is this analysis statistically valid? Considering the low number of analyzed isolates anything can be concluded.</p><p>Yes, this is statistically valid. Now that the scatter plots are shown you can see how distinct the populations are further supporting the statistics.</p><p>Lines 277-278 FIG S2B is not mentioned in the text and due to the lack of significant results I would suggest the authors to delete totally this analysis.</p><p>We have removed this graph from the supplemental figure.</p><p>Lines 310-317 These results are not very solid. Are the antibiotics tested capable to permeate epithelial cells? If not, no conclusions can be drawn from these experiments. I suggest to use an antibiotic that penetrate the cells to evaluate if bacteria forming IBCs are somehow resistant or not.</p><p>We have added text to further clarify this. Even though cephalosporins have lower intracellular penetration then fluoroquinolones, we used their known penetration rates to ensure that the MIC was achieved within the cell. However, we understand that this is not well described and has now been updated throughout the text.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Discussion section should be shortened We have removed a paragraph.</p><p>Lines 338-340 Please, lower your enthusiasms about the implications of your model. This type of conclusion cannot be drawn based on the reported results. We changed the use of robust to potential to dampen the enthusiasm.</p><p>Lines 348-349 As stated before, this conclusion cannot be drawn. See above.</p><p>Lines 350-351 As stated before, this conclusion cannot be drawn. See above.</p><p>Line 442 See comment above. Are these antibiotics able to permeate the bladder cells? See above.</p><p>Line 462 With the current knowledge it is very difficult to assign one specific pathotype to an E. coli isolate. So it would be better to increase the number of gene tested to increase the probability of a correct classifications. The list of genes associated with UPEC isolates is reported in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10123-022-00235-y" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10123-022-00235-y</ext-link> and references therein.</p><p>We appreciate this evolving field and the additional characterization that is available. At this point, we are most interested in replicating intracellular bacterial communities with canine UTI strains; we could continue to further characterize these isolates but for use in this purpose of this study we don&#8217;t think it would change or enhance our findings. </p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Line 335 Please, use only the acronym. This has been corrected</p><p>Line 357 Can the authors compare these rates with published data? We have added this.</p><p>Lines 408-410 Are there evidences of the presence of other adhesins involved in bacterial internalization? Not in bladder epithelium. In kidney cells, the P fimbriae are important. In the intestine a variety depending on the pathotype and location are important.</p><p>Lines 433-434 In my opinion, a model for canine related UTIs is needed to study canine UTIs. Now there are several advanced models based on human cells to evaluate human UTIs. We disagree respectfully. In our opinion as translational scientists, having large animal models of spontaneous disease can fit the NIH&#8217;s species definition of &#8220;Dual Purpose with Dual Benefit&#8221;. In that discoveries made in the canine model can be translated to human medicine. If you think about new drugs that need to be tested in relevant models, the canine model could be the key step between murine experiments and first-in-human trials. In fact, clinical trials performed in dogs for relevant diseases can be used as preclinical data supporting IND submissions to the FDA. Therefore, showing that the pathophysiology for UPEC-associated UTIs is the first step towards this.</p><p>Line 437 What is the meaning of one health model? Probably it would be better to highlight the fact that UPEC strains can infect humans and dogs, if this is correct. For example, are there studies describing the relationship among human and canine isolates? As stated in the above response, One Health approaches are powerful tools to advance both veterinary and human medicine. If one can show similarities in disease processes, than findings i</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0316834.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers 2.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0316834.s006.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0316834.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0316834.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Asare</surname><given-names initials="KK">Kwame Kumi</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Kwame Kumi Asare</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Kwame Kumi Asare</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0316834" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

The authors addressed all the points I made. Therefore, I think it can be accepted.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>Reviewer #11:&#160;The authors have addressed all major points raised in the previous round of review. They are to be commended for their efforts in addressing the responses of so many reviewers. In particular, the larger images with better labelling are visually more striking, and the use of arrows makes it straightforward to identify features of interest. They have also clearly demonstrated that they are identifying IBCs and not intracellular bacteria in general within the tissues. The new text on the effects of antibiotic treatment also clarifies better the nature of the different antibiotics used and how this reflects in the results that the authors observe. We agree with the authors that the citation list is already long, and so leave it to their judgement whether to take on board the suggestions we made in the last round of review.</p><p>There are only some minor points that need editing before acceptance:</p><p>1. The exact duration of antibiotic treatment is still not mentioned. Could the authors include this in the Main Text?</p><p>2. It would be helpful to the reader if the correspondence between the number of stars and the p values are also mentioned in the Figure Legends wherever appropriate.</p><p>3.

</p><p>Review #9</p><p>Lines 56-57 of the revised manuscript track change on, Several papers described the association between IBCs and rUTIs in humans. The authors should underline that this association is still unknown for canine rUTIs. Corrected.</p><p>Please, use E. coli instead of Escherichia coli. Correct it throughout the text. Corrected.</p><p>Bars in Fig 4 are still not understandable and informative. The authors should underline that the tested isolates showed high variability in IBCs formation capacity. There are isolates with no capability to be internalized within bladder cells, vice versa there are isolates forming IBCs. Moreover, CFU/ml counting should be expressed for each isolates known to form IBCs. Finally, fig legend has some mistakes, please revise it. Changed from bars to lines. The black lines denote the mean and standard deviation and the open blue circles represent the individual UPEC strains. The figure legend has also be updated and edited.</p><p>Lines 201-203 of the revised manuscript track change on. The size cannot be expressed in molarity. Corrected.</p><p>Line 536 of the revised manuscript track change on, the ref 26 does not report the PCR method used to verify the presence of ExPEC associated genes. Which primers did the authors use? Can the authors add the more appropriate reference? Corrected.</p><p>Reviewer 11</p><p>1. The exact duration of antibiotic treatment is still not mentioned. Could the authors include this in the Main Text? Corrected.</p><p>2. It would be helpful to the reader if the correspondence between the number of stars and the p values are also mentioned in the Figure Legends wherever appropriate. Corrected.</p><p>3. Line 54: &#8220;To date, it is unknown if IBCs play a role in UTI recurrence&#8221; some of the evidences regarding IBC playing a role in UTI recurrence can be recognized from movies from mouse models by Justice et. al (2004) and bladder-on-a-chip model by Sharma et.al (2021).

Amended for clarity with numbers in parentheses.</p><p>10. Line 306: could the authors add the appropriate reference for the C/E values for the antibiotics as this is the first time that this parameter is mentioned? We are unclear what C/E means. We are reporting Cmax or peak concentration in urine based on the referenced canine pharmacokinetics studies. We attempted to reword the sentence to clarify this statement better.</p><p>11. Line 313. Delete one of the extra periods at the end of the sentence. Corrected.</p><p>12. Figure 7B. The X axis labels are missing, and the description of how the CFU values are obtained is unclear based on the text given in the legend. Are the authors measuring the total bacterial load per well (intracellular and extracellular)? What does &#8216;unfixed to release the release the intracellular bacteria&#8217; mean? Does it mean that the host cells were lysed? Corrected for clarity. The gentamicin kills extracellular bacteria, so when we lyse the urothelial cells we are only quantifying the intracellular bacteria.</p><p>13.
