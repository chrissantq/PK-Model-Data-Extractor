The aim of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of levodopa following LECIG and levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion to investigate suitable translation of dose from LCIG to LECIG treatment, and the impact of common variations in the dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes on levodopa pharmacokinetics. A non-linear mixed-effects model of levodopa pharmacokinetics was developed using plasma concentration data from a double-blind, cross-over study of LCIG compared with LECIG in patients with advanced Parkinson&#8217;s disease (n&#8201;=&#8201;11). All patients were genotyped for rs4680 (polymorphism of the COMT gene), rs921451 and rs3837091 (polymorphisms of the DDC gene). The final model was a one compartment model with a high fixed absorption rate constant, and a first order elimination, with estimated apparent clearances (CL/F), of 27.9 L/h/70&#160;kg for LCIG versus 17.5 L/h/70&#160;kg for LECIG, and apparent volume of distribution of 74.4 L/70&#160;kg. Our results thus suggest that the continuous maintenance dose of LECIG, on a population level, should be decreased by approximately 35%, to achieve similar drug exposure as with LCIG. An effect from entacapone was identified on all individuals, regardless of COMT rs4680 genotype. The individuals with higher DDC and COMT enzyme activity showed tendencies towards higher levodopa CL/F. The simultaneous administration of entacapone to LCIG administration results in a 36.5% lower apparent levodopa clearance, and there is a need for lower continuous maintenance doses, regardless of patients&#8217; COMT genotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Movement disorders</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>Medical genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Uppsala University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by Uppsala University</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is a treatment developed for patients with advanced Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) when oral treatment fails to provide sufficient stability in symptom relief<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Continuous infusion of drug, resulting in a more stable plasma concentration, stabilizes the symptom fluctuations (on&#8211;off phenomenon) as well as decreases the time with dyskinesia (levodopa-related involuntary movements)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The levodopa/entacapone/carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) is a gel with the addition of entacapone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Entacapone is a reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme responsible for the second major metabolic pathway of levodopa. The addition of carbidopa causes inhibition of dopa decarboxylase (DDC), which is the enzyme responsible for the largest part of levodopa&#8217;s metabolism. The addition of entacapone has shown to allow lower levodopa dose administration through the inhibition of COMT, thus increasing levodopa plasma concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The drug-containing gel is infused directly into the small intestine, via a gastrojejunostomy tube, bypassing the stomach, and is thereby not affected by gastric emptying, which usually has a negative and erratic impact on levodopa absorption. The infusion treatment, most commonly administered only during day-time, consists of a morning bolus dose and a continuous maintenance infusion. The morning bolus dose is administered at the highest pump rate (40&#160;mL/h) to allow levodopa to rapidly reach therapeutic plasma concentrations. When initializing LCIG treatment, the doses are based on the patients&#8217; previous oral levodopa morning dose, and total daily dose. Patients can also administer small bolus doses (extra doses) during the day, if needed.</p><p id="Par4">A previous pilot study was conducted where oral entacapone (200&#160;mg, every 5&#160;h) was added to LCIG treatment. With a 20% decrease in LCIG dose with the COMT inhibitor, the plasma concentrations at steady state (0.5&#8211;8&#160;h) did not differ compared to LCIG administered alone without dose adjustment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In a clinical trial investigating the infusion of LECIG using a 20% reduction of morning and maintenance infusion doses, the morning levodopa plasma concentrations were found to be lower than following infusion of LCIG, and there was a trend towards an accumulation in levodopa concentrations throughout the day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This may result in insufficient symptom relief in the morning and an increased risk of dyskinesia in the latter part of the day. The LCIG treatment was highly individualized, with morning and continuous maintenance doses to meet individual patient needs. The patients were also allowed to administer extra doses if needed, which complicates the data analysis when using conventional area-based methods.</p><p id="Par5">It was also observed that not all patients had the same increase in levodopa plasma concentration with the new treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and it was hypothesized that a reason for this could be differences in enzyme activity. Genetic variations in the gene encoding for the enzyme COMT (rs4680), and in the DDC promoter gene (rs921451 and rs3837091) have been suggested to affect the natural activity and/or expression of the respective enzymes, which in turn may affect the pharmacokinetics of levodopa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Hypothetically, an individual with e.g. high COMT activity may benefit the more from the addition of entacapone, and polymorphism related to DDC might be correlated to the effect of carbidopa on levodopa pharmacokinetics.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of this analysis was to investigate the impact of simultaneous entacapone infusion on levodopa pharmacokinetics using a model-based approach to provide a translation of dose from LCIG to LECIG treatment, based on previously published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and to investigate the effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics by genotypes of the DDC and COMT genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par7">Eleven patients were included in a randomized, open-label, 2-day crossover clinical trial (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The local Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden and the Swedish Medical Products Agency approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. For two consecutive days, patients were randomized to receive one of two treatment sequences, LECIG/LCIG or LCIG/LECIG. LECIG morning doses corresponded to 80% (n&#8201;=&#8201;5) or 90% (n&#8201;=&#8201;6) of their LCIG morning dose, 80% of the LCIG continuous maintenance dose, and 80% of the dose for extra bolus administrations. The treatment duration was 14&#160;h, at which point the tube was immediately flushed with water, as is required with both treatments. When flushed, the gel left in the tube, approximately 3&#160;mL, is infused. This volume corresponds to 60/15&#160;mg of levodopa/carbidopa (LCIG) and 60/60/15&#160;mg of levodopa/entacapone/carbidopa (LECIG).

The SNP in the COMT gene (rs4680)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> results in the substitution of A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;G, which causes the conversion of the enzyme valine (158Val, higher activity) to methionine (158Met, lower activity).

Thereafter, differences in parameter estimates were successively investigated, to evaluate the impact of simultaneous entacapone infusion. One and two compartment disposition models with first order absorption were evaluated, parameterized in terms of absorption rate (ka), relative bioavailability (Frel), apparent volume of central (V<sub>C</sub>/F) and peripheral (V<sub>P</sub>/F) compartment, apparent clearance (CL/F) and inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). Inter-individual variability was included assuming a log-normal distribution of structural model parameters. Bodyweight was included as a primary covariate on all disposition parameters according to the allometric power model, with allometric power exponents or 0.75 for CL/F and 1 for V/F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Oral levodopa-carbidopa tablets were allowed as night time medication during the study, but only until 3&#160;h before morning dose. Eight individuals took night-time medication 01:10&#8211;05:50&#160;h after stop of LECIG administration and 01:43&#8211;04:28&#160;h after stop of LCIG, and very few blood samples were collected in relation to the oral treatment. Thus, the information available was too sparse to allow for estimation of the absorption related parameters for the oral levodopa treatment. Therefore, based on a previously published levodopa pharmacokinetic model where oral levodopa-carbidopa tablet administration was compared to LCIG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the absorption model for oral treatment was described with a single transfer rate constant fixed to 2.4&#160;h<sup>-1</sup> with one transit compartment between the depot and central compartment, and a relative difference in Frel of 1.03. Since number of levodopa measurements below the limit of quantification was low (1.9%) these samples were handled using the M6 method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, where LOQ/2 is assigned to the first value and subsequent samples below LOQ were ignored. The difference in levodopa parameters for LECIG were investigated as a relative difference in the estimate of CL/F, ka and F<sub>rel</sub> compared to LCIG. The effect of food intake was explored both as a binary variable (yes/no), and as a continuous variable reflecting the amount of protein intake, that was assumed to decrease the drug absorption during an estimated period following food intake. For investigation of dosing regimens<bold>,</bold> a simulation dataset was created with the same number of individuals and the same demographic characteristics as the individuals included in the model development dataset.

The estimated absorption rate constant (ka) for both treatments was very high, and was therefore fixed to 50&#160;h<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the lowest value which did not give a significant increase in OFV. Estimation of a two compartment model resulted in an OFV drop of 23, however the distribution phase was estimated to be very fast and the model became unstable with high uncertainty on the estimated parameters. Inter-individual variability was explored on all parameters, and found to be significant on CL/F and Vc/F. Addition of an inter-individual variability on relative bioavailability resulted an OFV drop of 5.85, but was associated with a high relative standard error (190%) and model instability, and was therefore not retained in the model. The model improved, with a difference in OFV of &#8722;&#160;436, when the effect of entacapone was estimated as a shift in the typical value of levodopa CL/F, including an inter-individual variability in the shift parameter. The population parameter for CL/F was estimated to 27.9 L/h/70&#160;kg for LCIG and to be 36.5% lower for LECIG, with associated inter-individual variabilities of 28% and 11%, respectively.

Following oral administration and intestinal infusion, levodopa pharmacokinetics has previously been described both with one- and two-compartment models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The data following continuous infusion did in our case not allow for an estimation of a second, peripheral compartment. The estimated typical value for levodopa CL/F following treatment with LCIG was 28 L/h/70&#160;kg (95% SIR CI 25&#8211;32 L/h). This is in agreement with previous reported values, from population pharmacokinetic studies that included advanced PD patients that received high doses co-administered with carbidopa. Othman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> reported a CL/F of 25 (95% CI 20&#8211;27) L/h for levodopa administered as intestinal infusion, Jorga et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> reported separate levodopa CL/F for a fluctuating and non-fluctuating patient population, of 25 L/h and 29 L/h respectively, and Simon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> reported a CL/F of 37 (95% CI 31&#8211;43) L/h for oral levodopa/carbidopa administration. The previously reported values for V/F vary widely, between 43 and 131 L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We estimated V/F to 75 L/70&#160;kg (95% SIR CI 63&#8211;88 L), which is in line with the previously reported estimates. The wide difference in estimates could be a result from differences in the study population (e.g. disease severity), the doses administered, blood sampling time points, as well as the route of administration. As an example, Jorga et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> estimated different V/F, for the fluctuating and non-fluctuating patient population (99 and 124 L respectively).</p><p id="Par19">The CL/F with entacapone addition was estimated be 37% lower (95% SIR CI 33&#8211;39%), i.e. 17.7 L/h/70&#160;kg, compared with LCIG. In the previous non-compartmental analysis, it was observed that the plasma concentration was increasing over time with LECIG, and that the doses had not been adjusted appropriately with the addition of entacapone. The current analysis, using population modelling, has the advantage that extra doses and oral dosing are appropriately taken into account, and that the change in plasma concentration over time can be described. Another advantage is that the variability between individuals, as well as the magnitude of the unexplained variability, can be handled with a model based analysis. The conclusion from this analysis is that the continuous maintenance dose should be reduced by approximately 35%, on a population level, when entacapone is simultaneously infused. This is in contrast to the previously suggested reduction by 20% when an LCIG infusion is administered with oral entacapone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Entacapone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. A recently developed model, investigating entacapone pharmacokinetics suggested that 6&#8211;11% is lost due to intestinal metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The immediate delivery of entacapone to the small intestine with the infusion, and perhaps a shorter intestinal residence time, may result in a higher bioavailability of entacapone, and thereby higher inhibition of COMT compared with oral administration. An infusion of entacapone results in an even plasma concentration, as opposed to oral administration, where administration every 5&#160;h could result in decreased inhibition before next dose intake and more fluctuations in levodopa plasma concentration, although this was not observed in the infusion study with oral entacapone administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Maximum inhibition of COMT is probably reached early on during the infusion since entacapone reaches steady state within 1&#160;h and because previous studies indicate that there is no delay between maximum entacapone plasma concentration and COMT inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">From the observed plasma concentration&#8211;time curve, there is a tendency that the model initially over predicts the plasma concentration following LECIG administration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The reason for this low initial levodopa concentration is not clear, but has been observed previously with oral multiple-dose administration of levodopa/entacapone/carbidopa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. One suggested reason for the observed slower absorption was that more levodopa was available with the addition of COMT inhibitor, and that is thereby competing with itself for the saturable large neutral amino acid transporters that transport levodopa across the intestinal membrane. It was also suggested that the delay in absorption could be related to a delayed gastric emptying, caused by higher levodopa concentrations, however this would not be an influencing factor in this study with the infusion treatment, which is bypassing the gastric emptying. Entacapone has molecular similarities to levodopa, and may also compete for transport across the intestinal membrane with levodopa, potentially affecting the rate of levodopa absorption, however, this has been investigated for one of the transporters responsible for levodopa transport and not been found to be the case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The data did not allow for an estimation of a difference in rate of absorption or volume of distribution between the investigated treatments and thus it is difficult to make conclusions regarding any adjustments of the morning bolus. To investigate this further, administration of bolus doses only, and/or repeated sampling at a longer time period post dosing could be informative.</p><p id="Par22">A formal covariate analysis of the effect of genotype on CL/F was not performed, due to the low number of included subjects, and with relatively high shrinkage in CL/F shift parameter (23.5%), the results are primarily exploratory. The comparison in CL/F based on the different genotypes was only graphically investigated. Corvol et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> found a significant decrease in CL/F for both low (by 25%) and high (by 40%) activity COMT groups (according to COMT<sub>SNP</sub> rs4680) when oral levodopa/carbidopa was co-administered with 200&#160;mg of oral entacapone. The decrease in the group with high COMT activity was significantly higher compared to the low activity group. Similarly, we found that CL/F decreased for all individuals (95% SIR CI 34&#8211;40%), regardless of genotype, with the addition of entacapone. In contrast, we do not see any clear trend in the decrease in CL/F for patients with high COMT activity compared to other COMT<sub>SNP</sub> subgroups. The results suggest that all patients, irrespective of COMT rs4680 polymorphism, have a high reduction in CL/F with an addition of simultaneously infused entacapone. No clear trend was observed between administered doses of entacapone and the model predicted decrease in CL/F (data not shown), so a dose dependent decrease in CL/F was not explored.</p><p id="Par23">The plasma concentrations were variable within an individual, with trends observed around the time points of food intake. Protein intake was therefore investigated as a covariate on the rate of absorption and relative bioavailability. Protein intake may interact on transporters in the gastro-intestinal tract and across the blood&#8211;brain barrier, possibly causing lower levodopa plasma concentration and an absence or delay of effect after dose intake in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, possibly due to high inter-individual variability and few individuals, it was not possible to characterize the food effect in the present model. Further, to study the food effect was not one of the objectives of the study, and the sampling times were not optimized for this investigation. The variability in plasma concentration over time observed in the data could also be due to other effects, such as differences in gastro-intestinal motility, and overall mobility of the patients, which could coincide with food intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">The CL/F is estimated to be 36.5% lower with simultaneous infusion of entacapone. When switching from LCIG to LECIG, our results suggest that the continuous maintenance dose needs to be decreased by approximately 35% on a population level. An effect from entacapone was identified on all individuals, regardless of COMT<sub>SNP</sub> polymorphism.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Clinical Trial Consultants AB (CTC), Uppsala, Sweden, for conducting the study, Uppsala Clinical Research center for DNA extraction, the support of the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) / Uppsala Genome Center for genotyping.
