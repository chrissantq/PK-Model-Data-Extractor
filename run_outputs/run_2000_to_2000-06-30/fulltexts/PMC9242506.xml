Phantoms were imaged with four different concentrations of diluted Gd-DOTA representing established arterial concentrations after intravenous injection in humans. Samples were centrally positioned in a thorax phantom of 30 cm diameter filled with a custom-made liquid featuring dielectric properties of muscle tissue. MRI was performed on a 7 T whole-body system. 2D-gradient-echo sequences were acquired with an 8-channel transmit 16-channel receive (8 Tx / 16 Rx) cardiac array prototype coil with and without pTX mode. Measurements were compared to those obtained with identical scan parameters using a commercially available 1 Tx / 16 Rx single transmit coil (sTX). To assess reproducibility, measurements (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 15) were repeated at different horizontal angles with respect to the B<sub>0</sub>-field.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX markedly improved flip angle homogeneity across the thorax phantom yielding a distinctly increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) averaged over a whole slice relative to non-manipulated RF fields. Images without B<sub>1</sub>-shimming showed shading artifacts due to local B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-field inhomogeneities, which hampered stenosis quantification in severe cases. In contrast, B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX provided superior image homogeneity. Compared with a conventional sTX coil higher grade stenoses (60% and 80%) were graded significantly (p&lt;0.01) more precise. Mild to moderate grade stenoses did not show significant differences. Overall, SNR was distinctly higher with B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX than with the conventional sTX coil (inside the stenosis phantoms 14%, outside the phantoms 32%). Both full and half concentration (10.2 mM and 5.1 mM) of a conventional Gd-DOTA dose for humans were equally suitable for stenosis evaluation in this phantom study.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX at 7 T can distinctly improve image homogeneity and therefore provide considerably more accurate MR image analysis, which is beneficial for imaging of small vessel structures.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#252;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01EO1004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Laura M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#252;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01EO1504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Laura M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Parts of this study were funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) with grant 01EO1004 and 01EO1504 (LMS).

For the detection of significant stenoses and prognostic classification of patients at risk of cardiovascular events, non-invasive imaging techniques are highly desirable [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For this purpose, international guidelines recommend computed tomography coronary angiography as a well-established tool in appropriately selected patients [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0270689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, important potential strengths of magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA) have maintained ongoing research interest in this topic. These advantages include imaging free of ionizing radiation, lumen visualization in the presence of calcifications, the potential of detailed tissue characterization, and concomitant non-invasive assessment of myocardial function, perfusion, and myocardial viability [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0270689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, MRCA has limited indications in clinical practice at 1.5 Tesla (T) and 3 T due to limits in spatial resolution, long scan times, motion artifacts and the partial volume effect [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Ultra-high field (UHF, B<sub>0</sub> &#8805; 7 T) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) features the potential of a distinctively higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], increased parallel imaging ability, and longer T<sub>1</sub> relaxation time [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared with standard CMR at 1.5 or 3 T. Hence, UHF-CMR at 7 T promises increased spatial and temporal resolution, shortened acquisition time, and potentially optimized image contrast. In a study comparing <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> human imaging of the right coronary artery at 3 and 7 T in young, healthy volunteers, parameters related to image quality attained at 7 T equaled or surpassed those from 3 T [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another study showed the feasibility of high resolution bright blood coronary MRA at 7 T [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Reiter et al. recently demonstrated that commercially available 7 T MRI systems allow for morphological and functional analysis similar to the clinically established CMR routine approach [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, UHF-CMR remains challenging in particular due to high specific absorption rates (SAR), inhomogeneity of the main field B<sub>0</sub> as well as the transmit radiofrequency field B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>. The inherently short electromagnetic field wavelength of the radiofrequency (RF) of ~300Mhz results in strong spatial inhomogeneity of the transmit B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-excitation profile [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0270689.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which often leads to inhomogeneous tissue contrast and potential signal loss in target organs such as the heart [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>A promising method to overcome these constraints is parallel transmission (pTX), the use of multiple independent transmission channels, which provides full spatial and temporal control of the RF fields [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

In gradient-echo sequences, B<sub>1</sub>-shimming markedly reduced shading artifacts caused by local inhomogeneities of the B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-field enabling a more balanced and precise stenosis evaluation. Imaging with a conventional sTX coil and a pTX coil without B<sub>1</sub>-shimming showed more shading artifacts. In severe cases, when local signal drops coincided with the location of the stenoses, quantification was not reasonably possible. In images acquired with a pTX coil using B<sub>1</sub>-shimming higher grade stenoses were rated significantly more accurately than when using a commercial sTX coil. In mild to moderate grade stenoses, both sTX and pTX approaches did not show significant differences.</p><p>Efficient visualization and quantification of vascular stenoses require a combination of high SNR and B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-field homogeneity, which is associated with a homogenous flip angle distribution. Low flip angles may lead to a local signal reduction, failure of magnetization preparation pulses, and eventually to artifacts and biased quantitative measures [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-field homogeneity is dependent on different prerequisites of the applied coil and the imaged object. The visibility of stenoses depends on the signal of the stenosis vs. the surrounding variation of signal intensities on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Thus, the reason for the superior stenosis evaluation with pTX and B<sub>1</sub>-shimming possibly lies in reduced B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-inhomogeneity because local variations of B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-induced signal variations may diminish the visibility of the stenosis. However, this finding may also be caused by overall higher SNR values compared to the conventional coil. Other reasons might be image errors, e.g. based on slice selection, in areas of inhomogeneous B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> or a combination of these mechanisms. In the context of this study, the underlying causes could not be fully identified and require further in-depth analysis.</p><p>In this study, two observers rated images of stenosis phantoms acquired with different Gd-DOTA concentrations typical for human studies. Both full and half concentration of a conventional Gd-DOTA dose for humans were equally suitable for stenosis evaluation. These results suggest that lower gadolinium concentrations than customary at 1.5 and 3 T may be sufficient for stenosis grading at UHF-CMR. In terms of patient safety, the application of reduced contrast agent concentrations without loss of image information is beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings are in concordance with previously published brain UHF-MRI studies [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0270689.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The results from this study also indicate that local B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-inhomogeneities may severely impair stenosis evaluation under certain conditions. In a phantom study, local signal drops may be corrected manually by repositioning of the imaged objects, adjusting the load of the coil, or changing imaging parameters. Under <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> conditions, however, this approach is hampered since it is hardly possible to detect slight shading artifacts overlaying small coronary vessels in the complexity of the human heart. Furthermore, the position of signal drops cannot be predicted reliably. Automated B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX might overcome these constraints to some degree and improve imaging of small vessels such as coronary arteries. Future studies should further address challenges with B<sub>0</sub>- and B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-inhomogeneity at 7 T to take advantage of increased SNR at ultra-high fields. This approach may help to enhance the diagnostic value of CMR and its current limitations at 1.5 and 3 T, since higher SNR may be used for improved spatial resolution or shorter scan times and thus reduce influence of motion.</p><p>The imaging parameters and phantom dimensions in this study were selected to be as close as possible to a human application. To enhance transferability, acquisition time was chosen to be similar to <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> measurements using breath-hold techniques. However, <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> conditions differ substantially from our thorax phantom due to overall SNR levels as well as susceptibility changes between different tissues, and motion artifacts. Hence, for a transfer to a human system several things such as varying breath hold capability, B<sub>0</sub>-shimming at 7 T or quality of the gating signal ECG, would have to be considered and the sequence would have to be adapted and reevaluated.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, it is not only the diameter of a stenosis that plays a key role in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Other essential factors are length, inner structure, the opening angle of a stenosis, and the constitution of the stenosis, which forms swirls and turbulences that hamper blood flow. Although statistical significance was reached when comparing moderate and severe stenosis grades with sTX and pTX coils, this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The decision on further management would not be based on a few percentage points. A lesion would still be classified as &#8217;significant&#8217; and would therefore be treated appropriately. However, it is potentially clinically relevant, if high-grade stenoses are misinterpreted as low grade stenoses.</p><p>As a limitation of this study, a performance evaluation of the pTX coil with and without B<sub>1</sub>-shimming was not reasonably achievable in high-grade stenoses due to severe interfering B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-inhomogeneities observed when imaging without B<sub>1</sub>-modification. Moreover, image noise analysis based on ROIs placed near the corners of the image may be biased in multi-channel receive coils [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

[<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Differences in the noise level were negligible comparing non-signal producing ROIs in the four corners of our images. The approach for SNR estimation by Constantinides et al. assumes the absence of noise correlation. This is unlikely to be the case for 16-channel receive coils. We therefore used relative SNR in this study, which additionally eases direct comparison. Bias in the SNR and noise most likely did not influence the results and the validity of the conclusions. A detailed comparison of the two different RF coil types (conventional sTX and prototype pTX coil) was not part of this study. Instead, our proof of concept study focused on the quantifiable effects of B<sub>1</sub>-shimming on image homogeneity. The partial volume effect can introduce significant errors in quantitative measurements, which plays an important role when imaging delicate structures such as high-grade stenoses in small vessels. The relatively large diameter of the reference vessel (5mm) limits applicability to coronary artery lesions that involve smaller major epicardials. Differences in phantom angulation might have hampered stenosis evaluation. However, much care was taken to ensure comparable imaging conditions between the different imaging modes, such as precise angulations of the phantoms. In stenosis phantoms, the distribution of the contrast agent was uniform, and slices were aligned to the centerline of the stenosis phantoms. These assumptions do not hold for imaging of the human vasculature. For example, atherosclerotic lesions in patients are not homogeneous and are frequently eccentric, which may impact diagnostic accuracy. The effects of flow and tissue inhomogeneity in human systems were not part of this study.</p><p>The phantom setup used in this study is relatively simple. Hence, direct translation of observed B<sub>1</sub>-inhomogeneity to the human body is limited. However, at 7T the B<sub>1</sub>-profiles in the thorax vary significantly with the subject weight, thorax shape, body-mass-index and fat-muscle distribution and no single phantom however complex could accurately represent this variety. We believe that the rather simple setup can already provide B<sub>1</sub>-conditions relevant for imaging of vascular stenosis, in particular considering the aim of this study: to assess capability and limitation of the vendor-provided shimming platform using a pTX-array. In addition to cardiac MRI the coils used in this study may be also applicable to imaging other locations e.g the vasculature of the lower extremities. Thus, results of this study may be applicable to such imaging applications as well, indicating that the vendor-integrated shimming process may already improve imaging conditions with respect to B<sub>1</sub>-inhomogeneity and therefore, also improve stenosis visualization in non-cardiac vessels.</p><p>Although RF shimming is a promising technique, it also has its limitations [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In particular, it requires a robust measurement of B<sub>1</sub>-field maps of individual transmit channels. Currently, the vendor-integrated B<sub>1</sub>-calibration procedure takes about 40 sec in non-triggered mode, but elongates to 2 minutes by activation of cardiac gating, which would be a requirement for accurate B<sub>1</sub>-field maps. This is not compatible with breath-hold measurements and research developments of calibration methods is required [<xref rid="pone.0270689.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0270689.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, currently, there is no vendor-provided subject-specific SAR safety concept available for the application of pTX-based B<sub>1</sub>-shimming (both static and dynamic) for thorax pTX-arrays in human subjects. Commercially available pTX arrays running in pTX mode are thus currently using preset phase and amplitude values, which have previously been validated with respect to SAR safety. This means that B<sub>1</sub>-shimming settings are computed for generic electromagnetic body models (&#8222;Duke&#8220;, &#8222;Ella&#8221;[SH1] etc) and then fixed for a specific coil. Operating with B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-shimming in 7 T thorax MRI, in general, requires the availability of highly experienced personnel and infrastructure for the electromagnetic simulations ensuring the SAR safety. To date, B<sub>1</sub>-shimming is a non-standard technique, where ongoing research may significantly improve image quality in future UHF cardiac MRI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>B<sub>1</sub>-shimming and pTX can improve overall image homogeneity at 7 T, which is especially beneficial when evaluating small vessel structures such as coronary arteries.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;In this article, the authors investigated the effects of B1-shimming pTX on image homogeneity compared with pTX without B1-shimming on ultra-high field cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, they compared the measurements of stenosis using phantoms filled with gadolinium-based contrast agent (for Gd-DOTA) performed on images acquired with B1-shimming pTX with those obtained from images acquired with commercial sTX, they rated qualitatively the subjective evaluation of the stenosis for different Gd-DOTA dilution series, and they compared SNR measurements on images acquired with B1-shimming pTX compared with sTX. I believe this study is interesting to the field and has been performed elegantly and properly. The research objectives are well-defined, and the study design is appropriate. The figures and tables summarizing the main results are good. The article is well-written and its structure and organization are also good. The discussion section is informative and are contextualized with the results from peer-reviewed articles relevant to the topic. The references are in general appropriate, and include both newer and older studies. The conclusions drawn by the authors are in general supported by the data they present.</p><p>I have only a few minor points:</p><p>1. The authors should clarify how many measurements per type of stenosis have been performed by reader 2.</p><p>2. Similarly, in figure 6, it will probably be more informative to show all the data points in addition to the mean and standard deviations of the bar plots.</p><p>3. &#8220;Although RF shimming is a promising technique, it also has its limitations [36].&#8221; It would be interesting to list a few of them.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;General comment:</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the impact of B1-shimming on image homogeneity and stenosis evaluation at 7T in a phantom filled with with gadolinium based contrast agent. They also compare these results with those obtained with a single channel transmit coil.</p><p>While in principle the long term target is relevant in terms of public health (coronary stenosis evaluation with MRI at 7T), this study unfortunately does not bring new knowledge, and suffers from serious methodological shortcomings preventing the work from having meaningful relevance to real in-vivo situation. Here are a few examples of such deficiencies:</p><p>- the authors chose a static phantom, whereas blood flow is a fundamental and critical characteristic of MR angiography.</p><p>- multiple studies have carefully described ways to address the very challenging B0 and B1 inhomogeneities occurring in the torso at 7T. Here, the chosen phantom is not representative of real torso anatomy, whereas it has been described elsewhere, and in details, how B1 shimming and B0 shimming solutions need to be specifically optimized to their target in cardiovascular imaging at 7 Tesla.</p><p>- the "non-B1 shimmed" setting taken as a comparison basis here seems fairly meaningless: it is very well known that at 7T B1 shimming are needed to address B1 inhomogeneities and several approaches have been proposed for these challenges. Here, the authors simply rely on the vendor-based B1 mapping and shimming technique without reporting any details on parametric quantities. The "non B1 shimmed" setting seems to be defined arbitrarily at best. RF efficiency and related SAR impact are not discussed. All these considerations can be critical for a technique meant to be ultimately applied in humans.</p><p>- this study does not include electromagnetic simulations that have become almost unavoidable when addressing transmit B1 issues with multiple channels at 7T.</p><p>- there is no description of the single transmit RF coil (not even the size is reported)</p><p>Even before considering the aforementioned problems, the purpose of the study seems quite elusive from the beginning. Indeed, in experiments like the ones reported by the authors, it is perfectly known that poor B1 profiles will occur (non shimmed multi channel transmit coils at 7T) and that the latter will translate in very poor and heterogeneous Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) (multiple studies have reported this in details). Observing poorer precision in diameter or stenosis evaluation when SNR is low and heterogeneous is a straightforward and fully expected consequence. That transmit B1 contributes to this deleterious effect is as much predictable. Likewise, the comparison between the impact of single or multi channel transmit coil does not tell more than what is already known about transmit B1 characteristics.</p><p>As a result, this reviewer could not identity relevant conclusions coming from the study.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Page 4, line 7. MRI is not a radiation-free imaging technique as claimed by the authors. It is free of ionizing radiation, but electromagnetic waves are radiations, even at radio frequencies. This language needs to be modified.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

However, I have several concerns related to these graphs and in general to figure 6:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Please make sure that all data points are visible in the additional graphs on panel b and c: there might be some overlapping points which prevent them to be visible (see for example for stenosis type 0%, only 1 point is visible, both in panel b and in panel c, instead of the stated 15 points).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The y-axis name &#8220;mean absolute difference&#8221; in panels b and c is possibly incorrect, since negative values are also present.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The legend for panel a currently reads &#8220;Error bars indicate the range of the absolute differences across the phantoms&#8221;, which seems incorrect since, also in this case, the error bars include negative values.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The error bars in panel a are confusing because they look to be the opposite of the actual data shown in panels b and c: if I understand this correctly, the top of the error bar represents more negative differences, whereas the bottom of the error bar represents more positive differences. My recommendation is to report the mean difference in panel a, rather than the mean absolute difference. This would also facilitate the interpretation, showing that there is overestimation of the MRI measurement compared with real measurement rather than underestimation (which might not be obvious to all the readers). If the authors want to follow this recommendation, please edit the y-axis and the text, and in the figure legend please specify whether the difference is &#8220;MRI &#8211; real&#8221; or &#8220;real &#8211; MRI&#8221;.</p><p>If the authors want to keep the mean absolute difference, please specify in the figure legend the sign of the error bars.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the text, the authors wrote: &#8220;Quantification of stenoses using the sTX coil slightly overestimated high-grade stenoses by up to 6.1&#177;1.8%&#8221;. Therefore, I suppose that the differences (not absolute) in panels b and c are obtained by subtracting the real measure from the MRI measurement. Please clarify this point in the legend of figure 6 panels b and c.</p></list-item></list> Could you please revise the manuscript to carefully address these points?</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by May 14 2022 11:59PM.

While agreeing with the content of these additions, this reviewer is still confronted to a dilemma.</p><p>On the one hand, while the results obtained by the authors do not seem to be technically incorrect, what really is at stake is the relevance of the work. The authors refer to a 2021 study published in PlosOne on cardiac MRI at 7T in a cohort of 84 patients, but in this study the focus is not on MR angiography and the assignement of myocard segments to coronary artery branches is solely based on morphometry. The same paper illustrates in one figure the visibility of the proximal right coronary and of the proximal left coronary, but this is reported in a rather anecdotical fashion. To this day, the very small number of publications (not even an handful) that have been dedicated to visualizing coronary arteries with MRA at 7T are dated back to 2014 or before, which reflects upon the technical challenges still faced for cardiac imaging at 7T.</p><p>In their introduction, the authors insist on the expected advantages of 7T (higher SNR and parallel imaging performances, potentially better contrast) and they emphasize the superiority of 7T over 1.5T and 3T in this regard, but it cannot be claimed that the difficulties faced to addressed B0 , B1 and SAR related issues at 7T in the heart have been remedied in a suitable manner to consistently provide satisfactory quality.</p><p>On the other hand, the reviewer gives credit to the authors to have, in this revision, further emphasized the challenges and limitations of 7T cardiac imaging as well as the expected differences between their phantom model and in vivo acquisitions.</p><p>Specific point.</p><p>PDF page 4, before-last line, typo.
