The development of new formulations for classic chemotherapeutic drugs remains interests in studies. Camptothecin (CPT) is powerful antitumor agents in TNBC treatment though its clinic applications are limited by its low water solubility and systemic toxicity. To prepare a spatiotemporal controllable CPT nano-formulation, we construct a ROS-responsive self-assembly nanoparticle by combining hydrophobic CPT and hydrophilic 5-floxuridine (FUDR). A ROS-sensitive thioketal (TK) linker is used to prepare CPT-TK-FUDR (CTF). Next, we introduced IR780-based phototherapy to elicit massive ROS regeneration due to the endogenous ROS is not sufficient. IR780 is modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) to prepare HA-modified IR780 (HAIR) for its biocompatibility and tumor targeting ability improvement. CTF and HAIR self-assemble to form an attractive nano-bomb (HAIR/CTF NPs). HA accurately guides the NPs to tumor sites via HA-receptor recognition on tumor cells. After internalization, overexpressed intracellular HAase in tumor cells disassembles the NPs to free the contents. Due to the presence of IR780 molecules, the scheduled irradiation of 808&#160;nm laser induces massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which further result in the cleavage of TK linker for free drugs release. Additionally, ROS-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and near-infrared laser-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) synergistically worked to eradicate tumor cells. Then immunogenic cell death (ICD) was evoked by CPT and phototherapy to amplify antitumor immunity, thereby achieving primary and abscopal tumor inhibition. In conclusion, the HAIR/CTF nano-bomb realized spatiotemporal controllable drug release, exciting tumor eradication and attractive anti-metastasis efficacy via combination chemo/photo/immunotherapy, offering a valuable reference for the re-development of classic drug in future clinical practice.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par124">

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a challenge for treatment with antibodies and immunotherapy, thus making chemotherapy one of the most effective therapeutic strategies for this type of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, chemotherapeutics exhibits unpredictable adverse effects and unstable behaviors within the body. Consequently, in the past decades, researchers have dedicated themselves to developing new practical agents, prodrugs or innovative drug-delivery systems (DDSs).</p><p id="Par22">In the development of novel DDSs, Camptothecin (CPT), a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces DNA damage in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is extensively used for the treatment of a variety of cancers including TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CPT is considered one of the most classic and potential chemotherapeutic agents in twenty-first century. Still, its clinical application is limited by its poor solubility, systemic cytotoxicity, fast clearance and unexpected distribution in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hence, numerous efforts have been made to overcome the limitations of CPT to increase its clinic value, including the development of new nano-DDS of CPT such as liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], microspheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], microemulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and polymer micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Though, issues like low drug loading capacity and poor stability persist. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel camptothecin nano-delivery systems for clinical practice. Self-assembly strategy emerges as a promising method for nano-system preparation, significantly improving the drug-loading efficiency of pharmaceutical agents. The amphiphilic structure of drug molecules is a crucial factor in the formation of self-assembly nanoparticles (NPs) due to hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In clinical practice, camptothecin is often combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or its derivatives to treat various tumors. However, 5-floxuridine (FUDR) has superior hydrophilicity and better efficacy over FU thus it could be better than over 5-FU in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Consequently, the conjugation of hydrophilic FUDR with hydrophobic CPT will form an amphiphilic prodrug and promote self-assembly, thereby improving the drug loading of both drugs.</p><p id="Par23">In addition, the spatiotemporal control release of drugs in nanomedicines is crucial for cancer treatment. The preparation of stimuli-responsive DDSs is the main approach to achieve this purpose. Stimuli-responsive DDSs are activated by internal stimuli within the tumor microenvironment (TME), including pH, glutathione (GSH), enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or their combinations, thereby triggering a selective release or activation of antitumor drugs. Since both tumor cells and normal cells both have similar acidic pH in endosomes/lysosomes or higher intracellular GSH concentrations, widely reported pH- and GSH-responsive DDSs exhibit limited selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Conversely, hypoxia significantly increases ROS in tumor tissues, leading to more than 1000 times higher ROS levels in cancer cells (10&#8211;100&#160;&#956;M) compared to those in normal tissues (0.001&#8211;0.7&#160;&#956;M), thereby achieving selective drug release response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Unfortunately, the clinical applications of current ROS-responsive drug carriers such as polypropylene sulfide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], selenide-containing polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and polythioether ketone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are limited due to their complex preparation procedures, inevitable drug leakage, poor biocompatibility, low degradability, and significant cytotoxicity. In comparison, ROS-responsive prodrugs containing oxidation-unstable functional groups are more favored for their advantages including easy synthesis, higher compatibility, degradability, and lower off-target toxicity. Herein, by coupling CPT with FUDR through the ROS-responsive unstable group TK linker, the precursor drug CPT-TK-FUDR (CTF) was prepared. Achieving drug self-assembly can not only improve drug loading efficiency, but also enhance efficacy. And the nano-level size endowed the NPs passive targeting ability to decrease off-target toxicity via enhanced permeability and retention effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Another issue is, due to the heterogeneity of tumors, relying solely on endogenous ROS in deep tumor to promote drug release and activation may not achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Meanwhile, it needs to be emphasized that mono-chemotherapy easily leads to drug resistance, hence combination therapy is often used for further tumors eradication. For example, increasing endogenous ROS production through external stimuli can be achieved with additional interventions such as light, heat, or ultrasound waves. Among them, phototherapy has been considered a safe method for tumor ablation in various types of cancers, especially when combined with other treatment modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, effective co-delivery of photosensitizers and ROS-responsive prodrugs to enhance spatiotemporal drug release holds great appeal for cancer therapy. IR780 is a classic photosensitizer commonly used in near-infrared (NIR) light comprehensive therapies including photodynamic and photothermal treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that IR780 accumulated in tumors and shows promise as multiple agent for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for its exciting ROS production ability under infrared laser irradiation. We modified it with tumor-targeting hyaluronic acid (HA) to prepare HAIR, which could self-assemble with CTF to achieve precise targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs and photosensitizers. The HA-modified self-assembled nanoparticles actively target breast cancer cells that overexpress the HA receptor (CD44), enhancing the drugs' specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Except for the synergistic efficacy mentioned above, studies have revealed that free CPT and photo-therapy also effectively induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], promote the activation of immune responses to further eradicate residual tumor cells. Tumor cells undergoing ICD not only release ATP and HMGB1, but also induce CRT exposure on cell surface to facilitate the recruitment and maturation of DCs, thereby boosting the activation of cytotoxic T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and cascade systemic immune response to efficiently kill residual tumor cells and prevent tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Herein, in this study, we first constructed a ROS-responsive prodrug CTF and HA-modified IR780 (HAIR) to self-assemble the nano-bomb (HAIR/CTF). The hydrophobic composition, CPT and IR780 were concentrated on the core while the hydrophilic part including FUDR and HA were distributed on the waterfront side. After intravenous injection, the HAIR/CTF NPs would target the tumor sites. Once internalized by the tumor, the self-assembled nano-bombs are enzymatically degraded by intratumoral HAase which was overexpressed in most tumors, releasing CTF prodrugs and IR780. Upon exposure to 808&#160;nm near-infrared light, IR780 not only converts near-infrared light into local heat for PTT but also promotes abundant endogenous ROS production for PDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The massively increased intracellular ROS effectively facilitates the cleavage of TK linker for CTF prodrugs release. Moreover, ICD-induced immune responses further damage residual tumor cells to prevents tumor metastasis and regrowth. Collectively, we developed a chemo/photo/immunotherapy synergistic nano-bomb for spatiotemporal-controlled drug release at the tumor site. The modification of free drugs in the NPs enabled themselves better biocompatibility and less toxicity, along with better tumor targeting behavior. We hope our study provides new reference and application value for the re-development of conventional chemotherapy drugs in clinic practice for TNBC treatment.

NPs were internalized by tumor cells and lysed by intracellular HAase. IR780 molecules and CTF prodrug were released subsequently. After 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, large amount of ROS was elicited when IR780 absorbed laser energy. On the one hand, TK linker broken to release CPT and FUDR for chemotherapy. On the other hand, ROS-mediated PDT and heat-mediated PTT worked synergistically. Meanwhile, immunogenic cell death was induced by free drugs and NIR. The TAA was released and uptake by DCs. Then matured DCs further activated specific antitumor T cell response.

According to our theory, the successful release of CPT and FUDR relies on the TK bond cleavage in the presence of ROS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Therefore, we first evaluated the ROS-responsive property of CTF. We co-incubated CTF with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5&#160;mM) at 37&#160;&#176;C, and the release of CPT and FUDR from the prodrug was monitored using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicated that with prolonged incubation time, the signal of CTF decreased gradually and disappeared after 180&#160;min. Correspondingly, signals of CPT and FUDR appeared after 30&#160;min incubation and their retention time was 6.73 and 8.75&#160;min respectively which were shorter than that of the prodrug. These results suggested that the TK bond was broken when exposed to ROS and drugs were released in a time-dependent manner from the prodrug CTF (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The release profile of both CPT and FUDR and their kinetic analyses were nearly the same as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and Figure S15. Further statistical analysis revealed a half-life of approximately 45&#160;min for CTF when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> existed. These outcomes confirmed the effectiveness and ROS-response property of TK chemical bond in CTF prodrug. However, after 180&#160;min, while 100% of CPT released, approximately 10% of the CTF remained. This observation could be attributed to several factors: (1) incomplete degradation of the thioketal linker: The degradation of the ROS-responsive thioketal linker may not have reached 100% within the given time frame, leaving a small fraction of undegraded CTF. This could happen if the ROS levels or degradation conditions are not sufficient to fully break down the CTF structure. (2) Residual nanoparticles stabilization: Some nanoparticles may exhibit stabilization or aggregation, leading to the slow degradation or prolonged release of the remaining CTF. This would result in a small percentage of intact CTF that has not fully responded to the ROS-triggered degradation mechanism. (3) experimental sensitivity or detection limitations: The analytical methods used to quantify CPT and CTF might have sensitivity limitations, potentially resulting in a small fraction of CTF appearing to remain when it is close to complete degradation.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>Characterization of CTF prodrug and HAIR/CTF NPs. <bold>A</bold> The mechanism of CPT and FUDR release triggered by ROS. <bold>B</bold> The evaluation of CPT and FUDR release from CTF prodrug in the presence of ROS by HPLC and its kinetics analysis (<bold>C</bold>). <bold>D</bold> Particle size distribution of HAIR/CTF NPs. <bold>E</bold>, <bold>F</bold> TEM images of HAIR/CTF NPs before and after laser irradiation. <bold>G</bold> Stability of HAIR/CTF NPs in different solvents (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>H</bold> Zeta potential evaluation (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>I</bold> UV&#8211;vis spectrum of free IR-780, CTFR, HAIR NPs and HAIR/CTF NPs</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12951_2024_3050_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par53">Additionally, it is important to note that similar findings have been reported in other studies involving prodrug systems, where incomplete degradation of the prodrug is often observed despite full release of the active drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Physical characteristics of nanoparticles</title><p id="Par54">In this study, the prodrug CTF self-assembled with HAIR to form nanoparticles using a sonication-emulsification method, with the addition of DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> to enhance the stability and prolong the circulation time in vivo (Figure S14). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D) showed that HAIR/CTF NPs had a diameter of 146.30&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.94&#160;nm with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.106, indicating good uniformity. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed to observe the morphology of NPs before and after laser irradiation. The nanoparticles exhibited sphere morphology before laser irradiation but were lysed after that (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E, F). The average diameter of NPs was smaller than DLS measurement results due to the existence of hydrated layer, which increases the apparent size of nanoparticles. Also, changes in particle size were monitored at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96&#160;h (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). The results demonstrated that HAIR/CTF NPs nanoparticles exhibited negligible changes in size when dispersed in water over the testing period. Furthermore, the stability of HAIR/CTF NPs in PBS and 10% FBS was also investigated to simulate the conditions in vivo. The particle size remained stable around 140&#8211;150&#160;nm in both PBS and 10% FBS within 96&#160;h without significant fluctuation. This suggests their feasibility for subsequent studies at cellular and animal levels. Additionally, zeta potential was measured by DLS as well. IR780 solution showed a zeta potential of&#8201;+&#8201;25.4&#160;mV, while HAIR NPs, CTF and HAIR/CTF NPs presented &#8722;&#8201;3.69&#160;mV, &#8722;&#8201;5.47&#160;mV and &#8722;&#8201;11.73&#160;mV for HAIR/CTF NPs attributed to the negatively charged HA and DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> added (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H).

UV&#8211;vis spectra (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I) indicated that free CTF and IR780 exhibited maximum absorption wavelengths at 364.5&#160;nm and 781.0&#160;nm, respectively, while HAIR NPs showed a red-shifted maximum absorption at 791&#160;nm due to the conjugation structure introduced by 4-aminophenol. HAIR/CTF NPs exhibited characteristic absorption peaks at 370&#160;nm for CTF and 810&#160;nm for IR780, suggesting possible aggregation-induced red-shift of IR780 characteristic peaks in the nanostructure, thus further confirming the successful encapsulation of CTF and IR780 within the nanocarrier.</p><p id="Par55">Moreover, to determine the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of our NPs, the standard curve for CTF was investigated and depicted in Figure S13.

Only 18% and 20% of effective components were released after 7&#160;days, demonstrating minimal release of drugs from the nanoparticles without stimulation. In contrast, when exposed to 808&#160;nm laser irradiation or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, drugs rapidly released from HAIR/CTF NPs which indicated the NIR-triggered drug release behavior. Furthermore, based on the ROS-responsive property of TK bond in CTF as mentioned above, we evaluated the drug release behavior of HAIR/CTF NPs in the presence of 5&#160;mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The results revealed a significantly faster release rate of CPT from HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> group compared to HAIR/CTF NPs alone.

The drug release ratios of both drugs were around 98% after 7&#160;days and exhibited the highest rate during this period in comparison with other groups. As expected, sustained and proper CPT release was observed in HAIR/CTF NPs under the combination of NIR and ROS treatment, achieving approximately 100% release within a week.

When drug concentrations increased, CPT/FUDR mixture group demonstrated significant antitumor effects compared to CTF alone, possibly due to the limitation of drug release from prodrugs under insufficient intracellular ROS. The cytotoxicity of photosensitizer was mainly attributed to the laser energy absorbed by agents, therefore, HAIR NPs group maintained cell viability above 75% without laser irradiation at an IR780 concentration of 0.5&#160;&#956;g/ml. With laser irradiation, cell viability of HAIR NPs decreased to 34.7%. Meanwhile, HAIR/CTF NPs induced stronger tumor cell-killing effects at the same concentration, with cell viability reduced to 25.9%. This enhanced effect was attributed to IR780 inducing substantial ROS production upon laser irradiation, which activated the prodrug CTF to release free chemotherapeutic agents CPT and FUDR, thereby exerting synergistic chemotherapy. Therefore, with the increasing drug concentration, NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR groups exhibited much better antitumor effect than single NPs.

These results suggested negligible toxicity of the nano-formulations without laser irradiation to 4T1 cells. Therefore, HAIR/CTF NPs exhibited less cytotoxicity when the intracellular ROS level was low.

During the ICD process, exposure or release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as CRT, HMGB1, and ATP occurred. The ability of HAIR/CTF NPs to induce ICD can be validated by detecting levels of DAMPs inside and outside cells. Western blot assay was performed to examine the release of CRT and HMGB1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A).

Thus, we investigated the maturation of BMDCs in vitro. Tumor cells were treated with different formulations, and BMDCs were added into cell culture medium post-treatment. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that all interventions boosted BMDCs maturation, especially HAIR/CTF NPs with laser irradiation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). The combination of chemotherapy and PTT together exerted antitumor effect and promoted TAA release to activate BMDCs. The results implied that HAIR/CTF NPs with NIR could effectively kill tumor cells and triggered specific immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Cellular uptake and in vivo targeting assessment of HAIR/CTF NPs</title><p id="Par64">The targeting capacity was one of the key properties of nanoparticles to deliver interested cargos into tumor sites. Drugs need to be transported directly into tumor cells or tumor microenvironments for later killing effect. Therefore, we investigated the targeting ability of HAIR/CTF NPs both at cellular and animal levels. Firstly, at the cellular level, the internalization of NPs was evaluated by a confocal laser scanning microscope. The spontaneous red fluorescence of IR780 and blue fluorescence of CTF could directly reflect their intracellular position. However, the blue fluorescence covered up the signal of DAPI, so we used lysosome tracker with green fluorescence to locate the tumor cells as a replacement. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, after co-incubation, HAIR/CTF NPs entered the cytoplasm more than free IR780 and free CTF. With time passing, NPs were absorbed more by tumor cells while free IR780 remained nearly unchanged internalization via flow cytometry analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Even at the first hour, most of the nanoparticles were already internalized by tumor cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Interestingly, our NPs were partly co-localized with lysosomes. This may suggest that after cellular uptake, NPs were transported to lysosomes to disassemble and release effective drugs into intracellular space. Furthermore, we investigated the in vivo targeting ability of HAIR/CTF NPs. Mice were randomly divided into two groups: Free IR780 dye and HAIR/CTF NPs (equivalent concentration of IR780 was 1&#160;mg/kg, the dosage was 100&#160;&#956;l). Fluorescent images from IVIS system demonstrated that within 24&#160;h, NPs accumulated much more than free IR780 in tumor tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D&#8211;G, Figure S16). Our NPs even tend to target tumors more rather than being engulfed and eliminated by the liver (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H). Though normal tissues such as livers expressed CD44, studies have confirmed that tumor cells expressed much more CD44 to promote growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, our HAIR/CTF NPs accumulated more in tumors rather than normal tissues.<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;6</label><caption><p>Cellular uptake and targeting ability evaluation of HAIR/CTF NPs. <bold>A</bold> Cellular uptake of HAIR/CTF NPs at different time points.

This may be attributed to the nano-level size of NPs and the existence of positive-targeting component, HA. The nano-level size of our nanoparticles enables them to penetrate through leaky blood vessels that are characteristic of tumor tissues. This enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) allows the nanoparticles to accumulate in the tumor sites. On the other hand, HA has a high affinity for CD44 receptors, which are overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. This allows HA-modified nano-bomb to specifically bind to these receptors and internalized by the tumor cells. In addition, HA also possesses high water solubility and strong adhesion properties, enabling it to stably exist in the bloodstream and rapidly reach targeted tumor tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>HAIR/CTF NPs efficiently eradicate primary tumor and enhance antitumor immunity</title><p id="Par66">According to the promising tumor cell-killing effect in cellular level, we further evaluated the in vivo antitumor efficacy of our NPs. The administration procedure was illustrated in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A. According to Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B and Figure S17, HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR intervention exhibited the best tumor-killing effect whereas HAIR/CTF NPs group showed lower antitumor efficacy. This phenomenon indicated that while the nanoparticles successfully targeted tumor sites, the release of free drugs for tumor-killing was hindered by insufficient endogenous ROS. Therefore, it underscored the importance of near-infrared laser irradiation in triggering ROS production for nano-bomb disassembly. Additionally, HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group exhibited an 80% tumor cure rate whereas the HAIR NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group only suppressed tumor growth without completely eradicated tumors (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, D). We speculated that the chemotherapeutic agents released from the nano-bomb eradicated residual tumor cells in depth. The combined chemo/photo/immunotherapy using HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR intervention was found to be more effective than mono-phototherapy in the HAIR NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group. Compared to PBS group, NIR groups demonstrated varying degrees of tumor temperature rising (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E). The temperature increase caused by HAIR NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR treatment was lower than that of HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR treatment, suggesting less accumulation of HAIR NPs in tumor sites. We speculated this phenomenon may be attributed to the charge carried by the nanoparticles. Zeta potential analysis in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H revealed that HAIR NPs had a higher zeta potential than HAIR/CTF NPs, potentially making them easier to elimination by the innate immune system. In addition, repeated treatments may bring safety concerns. We monitored the mice weight and serum level of different factors (ALT, AST, Ur, Cr) to evaluate organic function damage. The body weight and serum levels of these factors were in normal ranges (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F and Figure S18A). Similarly, no significant damage was observed in major organs according to the H&amp;E staining results in Figure S18B. Consequently, mice that received HAIR/CTF NPs with or without NIR gained obviously longer survival rate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G). The H&amp;E staining images of excised tumors exhibited notable differences among groups, particularly in HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>H). Tumor matrix was evidently ablated and tumor cells was hardly to observe. As for TUNEL and Ki67 images, tumors of all mice that received NIR treatment exhibited cell death and cell&#8211;matrix degradation. The rising temperature in tumor sites contributed to these good results. Furthermore, NIR intervention led to increased release of CPT and FUDR from HAIR/CTF NPs, consequently enhancing cell apoptosis.<fig id="Fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;7</label><caption><p>HAIR/CTF NPs eradicated primary tumors and elicited enhanced immunity. <bold>A</bold> Schematic illustration of the treatment on tumor-bearing mice. <bold>B</bold> Tumor volume of mice received different interventions (n&#8201;=&#8201;6). <bold>C</bold> Excised tumors of mice after various treatment and its weight analysis (<bold>D</bold>). <bold>E</bold> Tumor temperature change after laser irradiation (n&#8201;=&#8201;6). <bold>F</bold> Mice weight analysis during the treatment (n&#8201;=&#8201;6). <bold>G</bold> Survival curve of mice received different treatments.

DCs often tend to engulf tumor-related antigen and then present them to effector immune cells such as cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) for downstream tumor-killing. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>I, we investigated DCs maturation in tumor tissues. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the effective DCs activation by multiple therapies in HAIR/CT NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group. The results were in consistent with our expectation mentioned above. According to the inherent nature of PTT, the temperature increase caused by PTT and the generation of ROS through PDT effectively killed tumor cells and induced ICD to enhance antitumor immunity. Therefore, with numerous cytokines and tumoral antigens release, DCs were polarized to CD80<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> maturation phenotype. The proportion of mature DCs in the HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group increased by more than 20% compared to the PBS group. Then CTLs (also known as CD8<sup>+</sup> cells) were recruited and activated in tumor sites to exert a direct tumor-killing effect. After the intervention of our NPs and laser irradiation, the ratio of CTLs infiltrated in tumor tissues increased by 35%, which was an exciting outcome (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>J). The tumor matrix degradation and improved infiltrated CTLs resulted in a higher proportion of CTLs in the NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR group compared to the mono-NPs group due to the synergistic effect of phototherapy, which resulted in. On the other hand, the DCs-CTL in tumor draining lymph nodes were also detected via flow cytometry, further confirmed the activation of specific antitumor response. The results are consistent with the trend of immune cell activation in tumors (Figure S19 and S20). Significantly, the activation of specific antitumor immunity was the key factor that inhibited tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Herein, we established an abscopal tumor model for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>HAIR/CTF NPs induced abscopal effect</title><p id="Par68">The ICD effect induced by our NPs could result in systematic antitumor immune response. Considering this, we further established a distant tumor in primary-tumor bearing mice and did not conduct any interventions on it. Mice were randomly divided into five groups according to the results in primary tumor efficacy experiments. To minimize the potential interference caused by intravenously injected drugs, we applied a strategy of administering different formulations intratumorally (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). The tumor volume and weight of the abscopal tumors showed a similar trend to the primary tumors that received the same interventions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B&#8211;E). Both primary and distant tumors were suppressed after all NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR interventions. With HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR treatment, mice even escaped from the growth of the abscopal tumor. And the immune cell proportion in the blood circulation also confirmed that after treatments systemic immune response was enhanced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F). They eliminated the circulated tumor cells from primary tumors thus led to smaller distant tumors and less metastasis. Additionally, the suppression of tumors led to less lung metastasis. The lung metastasis sites were labeled with Bouins dye for clearer observation. Images were captured and displayed in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G. Multiple metastasis sites were seen on the front and back surfaces of excised lungs in the control groups. Excitingly, after HAIR/CTF NPs&#8201;+&#8201;NIR intervention, lungs exhibited normal morphology and with no metastasis lesions.<fig id="Fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;8</label><caption><p>Abscopal antitumor effect of HAIR/CTF NPs. <bold>A</bold> Schematic illustration of treatments on bilateral tumor-bearing mice. <bold>B</bold> Image of primary tumor and distant tumor after different interventions. <bold>C</bold> Distant tumor volume analysis of mice in each group (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>D</bold> Distant tumor weight of mice in each group (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>E</bold> Bilateral tumor volume analysis of mice received diverse interventions in each group (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>F</bold> Ratio of immune cells in mice blood after different treatments (n&#8201;=&#8201;3). <bold>G</bold> Photographs of tumor metastasis lesion in lungs and partially enlarged H&amp;E staining images after different treatments and its statistical analysis <bold>H</bold>.

The combination of CTF-based chemotherapy and HAIR-based phototherapy synergistically destroyed tumor cells and boosted tumor antigen exposure to DCs through the ICD effect for immune activation. This led to significant eradication of primary and distant tumors, reducing circulating tumor cells and inhibiting lung metastasis while sparing major organ tissues. Therefore, the anti-distant-tumor effect of our nano-bomb was strongly verified in our experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusion and prospects</title><p id="Par70">The side effects of common chemotherapy agents remain challenges for decades since they were applied in clinic. Scientists have been dedicated to developing novel drugs or drug-delivery systems to resolve this problem. Nowadays, with the advancement in nanotechnology, we could explore new forms for existing drugs to overcome these obstacles. In this study, we manufactured a ROS-responsive nanoparticle to act as tumor bomb by the self-assembly of CTF prodrug and HA-modified IR780. The co-assembled HA-780 molecules played the "guide" role and triggered drug release when exposed to massive ROS induced by external NIR. The HAIR/CTF NPs exhibited spatiotemporal controllable drug release, promising tumor targeting ability, powerful ROS induction capacity, photodynamic and photothermal effect, exciting tumor eradication and antitumor immunity activation ability. The loaded chemotherapeutics exert innate tumor-killing effects, while phototherapy synergistically worked to generate ROS in PDT and ablate tumor stroma in PTT. Subsequently, ICD induced by both treatments release TAA to activate downstream immune response, thus further killed tumor cells escaped to the circulation so that metastasis and invasion were prevented. The whole process was in a positive feedback loop involving the ROS generation and tumor death. Still, there remains some issues for us to further study. For example, the broad applicability of HAIR/CTF NPs need more investigation in other tumor models. And more detailed biosafety data should be demonstrated to promote clinical translation of our NPs. In summary, we hope this self-assembly strategy of classic chemotherapy drugs brings new perspectives to researchers and doctors for clinical practice, providing an alternative option for patients to earn more quality life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
