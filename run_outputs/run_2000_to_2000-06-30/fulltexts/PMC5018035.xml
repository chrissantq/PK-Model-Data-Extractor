However, little is known about the distribution of xenobiotics, such as opioids, into VH in living organisms. The aim of this study was to simultaneously measure heroin and metabolite concentrations in blood and VH after injection of heroin in a living pig model. Six pigs were under non-opioid anesthesia during the surgical operation and experiment. Ocular microdialysis was used to acquire dialysate from VH, and a venous catheter was used for blood sampling. Twenty milligrams of heroin was injected intravenously with subsequent sampling of blood and dialysate for 6&#160;h. The samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography&#8211;tandem mass spectrometry. Heroin was not detected in VH; 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine were first detected in VH after 60&#160;min. The morphine concentration in VH thereafter increased throughout the experimental period. For 6-MAM, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> was reached after 230&#160;min in VH. In blood, 6-MAM reached <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> after 0.5&#160;min, with a subsequent biphasic elimination phase. The blood and VH 6-MAM concentrations reached equilibrium after 2&#160;h. In blood, morphine reached <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> after 4.3&#160;min, with a subsequent slower elimination than 6-MAM. The blood and VH morphine concentrations were in equilibrium about 6&#160;h after injection of heroin. In conclusion, both 6-MAM and morphine showed slow transport into VH; detection of 6-MAM in VH did not necessarily reflect a recent intake of heroin. Because postmortem changes are expected to be small in VH, these experimental results could assist the interpretation of heroin deaths.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Heroin</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetic</kwd><kwd>Vitreous humor</kwd><kwd>6-MAM</kwd><kwd>Ocular microdialysis</kwd><kwd>Pigs</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Japanese Association of Forensic Toxicology and Springer Japan 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heroin is a highly lipid soluble opioid prodrug with negligible affinity and efficacy to &#181;-opioid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. After intake, heroin is rapidly and completely converted to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) spontaneously or by serum and tissue cholinesterases, and by tissue carboxyesterases, among others. 6-MAM is further metabolized to morphine that is in turn metabolized in the liver to the inactive morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and the active morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), as well as several other minor compounds (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). In man, the blood elimination half-life for heroin is less than 5&#160;min, for 6-MAM around 15&#8211;20&#160;min, for morphine 2&#8211;3&#160;h, and for its glucuronides, 4&#8211;6&#160;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most intense phase of heroin effects, the &#8220;rush&#8221;, takes place shortly after intake. At this stage 6-MAM is the predominant metabolite in both blood and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Later, 1&#8211;2&#160;h after intake, morphine and M6G are the main metabolites able to mediate heroin&#8217;s effects.</p><p>In forensic toxicology, results from postmortem body fluids or tissues are used to interpret the role of drugs in each death. Postmortem redistribution of drugs is a major challenge in this interpretation, making the estimation of the true concentrations at the time of death difficult, especially in cases with long postmortem intervals and potentially substantial drug redistribution. Vitreous humor (VH) is used as an alternative specimen for toxicological interpretation, and it is assumed that this medium is less prone to postmortem redistribution, making the detected concentration more representative for the one present at the time of death. When trying to estimate a blood concentration from the one detected in VH, toxicologists fall short, because no studies have investigated the kinetics of heroin and metabolites in both blood and VH in vivo. Therefore, the penetration and detection times for drugs and metabolites in VH as compared to those in blood are unknown.</p><p>In fatal cases where heroin metabolites are detected, interpretation of the toxicological findings from different specimens is especially important, because the presence of metabolites and their concentrations can provide important information not only about the cause of death, but also about the time between intake of heroin and death. How heroin and its metabolites distribute into different body compartments after administration has previously been well described for blood and urine in man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; the distribution of heroin and its metabolites into the brain has been also reported in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the distribution into VH has been studied less thoroughly, and such knowledge is important when interpreting the death involving heroin.</p><p>Most previous studies investigating the distribution of heroin and metabolites in both blood and VH have used postmortem samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; antemortem in vivo kinetics of drugs in VH have been studied for only a very few drugs related to forensic toxicology in living animal models using rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study by Crandall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] compared concentrations of morphine in VH and blood for one time point in a porcine model. One of the main problems in the study of the kinetics of drugs in VH is the limited amount of VH available for sampling. This limits the number of time points and forces the use of different animals for the different time points increasing the spreading of the data. Some of the challenges associated with sampling from VH can be overcome by the use of ocular microdialysis, and this technique has previously been used to investigate drug distribution into the aqueous and vitreous body of the rabbit eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (for review see Boddu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]).</p><p>With more antemortem knowledge about both blood and VH kinetics of heroin and metabolites, the interpretation of postmortem cases is easier and more exact. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetics of these substances in VH might further open new perspectives about the utility of VH as a complementary sample in forensic toxicology. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the concentration&#8211;time profiles of heroin, 6-MAM, morphine, and M3G in both VH and blood after intravenous (i.v.) administration in the living organism using ocular microdialysis. This could further elucidate the usefulness of VH as a forensic material. Pigs were chosen as the preferred specimen for this study, because their physiology resembles that of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is previously indicated that formation of higher amounts of M3G could be expected in pig as compared to those in humans, and formation of M6G is not expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Heroin hydrochloride, heroin-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>, 6-MAM, 6-MAM-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>, 6-MAM-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>6</sub>, morphine-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>, M6G, M6G-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>, M3G, and M3G-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub> were obtained from Lipomed (Lipomed GmbH, Arlsheim, Switzerland); morphine from NMD (NMD Grossisthandel AS, Oslo, Norway); and morphine-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>6</sub> from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.

The inspired oxygen fraction was set to 0.35 and ventilation adjusted to keep expired end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration between 4.5 and 5.5&#160;kPa. The right internal jugular vein was cannulated with a triple lumen central venous catheter (CVC) and advanced to vena cava superior for pressure registration and for heroin administration and blood sampling. The administration of heroin and collection of blood samples were obtained from different lumens of the CVC to avoid cross contamination of samples. The right carotid artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure registration. A bladder catheter was placed by a mini-laparotomy to extract urine samples and measure diuresis and core temperature. Additional monitoring of the pig included electrocardiography, heart rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub>. Fluid administration during the experiment was made with i.v.

The guide dummy was then retracted and the microdialysis probe (AT6.14.4, AgnTho&#180;s) was placed through the guide into the vitreous body. The probe position was adjusted, by visual inspection through the lens, such that the 4&#160;mm long microdialysis membrane (outer diameter, 0.6&#160;mm) resided well suspended in the mid-VH, and was then secured with surgical tape (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>Microdialysis guide penetrating the pars plana with the probe extending through the guide shaft into the vitreous chamber of the eye</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="11419_2016_315_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Before implantation of the microdialysis probe, the probe was connected by fluorinated ethylene propylene-tubing to a syringe containing a physiological Ringer&#180;s solution with deuterated recovery calibrators (6-MAM-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>, morphine-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>6</sub>, M3G-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>3</sub>) for each compound under study. The syringe containing the perfusion fluid was placed in a syringe microinfusion pump (CMA 400; CMA Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden). The pump perfusion flow was set to 0.7&#160;&#181;L/min. After implantation of the microdialysis probe the pig received an i.v. bolus injection (2&#160;mL) of 20&#160;mg heroin through the CVC, followed by flushing with 10&#160;mL physiological saline solution. Dialysate was collected at 10&#160;min intervals, into vials containing 5&#160;&#181;L internal standards (ISs), during the entire experimental session. That is, 7&#160;&#181;L dialysate was collected per vial, giving a total sample volume of 12&#160;&#181;L including the ISs. The vials were placed in a fraction collector (CMA/470; CMA Microdialysis) cooled to 6&#160;&#176;C during collection. Concurrently, 0.1&#160;mL blood samples were taken through the CVC at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 30, and then at every 30&#160;min up to a maximum of 360&#160;min after the injection of heroin. In one pig, samples from the living pig were only taken until 180&#160;min after the injection, and postmortem samples were collected for another 150&#160;min (postmortem data is not included in the succeeding data processing).

To our knowledge, this is the first pharmacokinetic study on heroin metabolites in both blood and VH in the living animal. We observed a slow distribution from blood to VH for all of the heroin metabolites studied; heroin, however, was not detected in the VH. Importantly, the interval when 6-MAM can be detected was much longer in VH as compared to that in blood.</p><p>The strength of the present study is the tracing of the concentrations of heroin metabolites in VH in detail in a living animal. This was made possible by the use of the microdialysis technique, without regular aspiration demanding a large number of animals and incurring a high probability of blood contamination of the samples. Macha and Mitra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] stated that microdialysis was superior to direct sampling techniques and could be applied to study ocular drug pharmacokinetics without rendering considerable physiological changes to the ocular barriers and the intraocular environment. We chose the pig model because it resembles the human being in both size and physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and we found that the blood pharmacokinetics were comparable to data previously published on humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From the literature, it has also been indicated that glucuronidation and esterase-mediated hydrolysis in pigs is expected not to differ substantially from those of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. One weakness of this model is the lack of formation of M6G, which is also used in the interpretation of postmortem cases. There was also some inconsistency in the experimental period with sampling from the living animal, because it was prolonged as compared with the handling of postmortem samples, after we discovered the slow transfer to VH in the first pig. In the first pig, where postmortem samples were also collected for 150&#160;min after death, the blood/VH concentration ratios of 6-MAM, morphine, and M3G continued to fall during the postmortem period (data not shown). This needs to be studied in more detail. The results in the present study were quite consistent among the animals, with only one pig showing higher concentrations of 6-MAM and M3G in VH (shown by dark blue circles in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, g), but not in blood (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, d). These findings might reflect the fact that individual differences in penetration could be expected, but their prolonged detection times in VH were still to be expected.</p><p>Our results are in accordance with the limited previous studies on kinetics of drugs of abuse in VH. In rabbit models, equilibrium between blood and VH for ethanol after its i.v. administration was attained after 10&#8211;20&#160;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], for diazepam 60&#8211;120&#160;min after its i.m. administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and for MDMA 30 and 120&#160;min after its i.m. administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Crandall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that morphine appeared in the aspirated VH 20&#160;min after i.v. administration of a fatal dose (about 120&#160;mg) of morphine using a pig model. However, in our experience, it was difficult to avoid blood contamination of the aspirated VH samples, and we believe that it cannot be excluded that the results presented by Crandall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are influenced by blood contamination. We also observed early and high levels of both morphine and M3G in our aspirated blood-contaminated VH samples (data not shown).</p><p>Although the pharmacokinetics of opioids in VH in vivo has not previously been studied in detail, a number of previous studies have investigated on the postmortem relationship between blood and VH concentrations for different drugs. Our results could explain the findings in two previous studies regarding heroin metabolite ratios of blood to VH. Bogusz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] compared concentrations in femoral blood versus VH in 12 human cases where deaths were attributed to intoxication with heroin. The concentrations of morphine were generally lower in VH than in blood, and they found a mean ratio of blood/VH of 4.2 for morphine; 6-MAM was most often not detected, or only trace amounts were found in either blood or VH (LOD 0.5&#160;ng/mL). They concluded that lower concentrations of morphine and its glucuronides in VH as compared to those in femoral blood might reflect a slower distribution of drugs to VH, which was verified in our study (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d, f, g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Wyman and Bultman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] investigated 25 autopsy cases identified as heroin exposures. They also found concentrations of morphine higher in femoral blood than in VH, with a mean blood/VH concentration ratio of 3.5. For 6-MAM, however, they found that its concentrations in VH, in general, were higher than in femoral blood, with a blood/VH concentration ratio of 0.2. They concluded that the possibility of detecting 6-MAM in postmortem specimens could be greatly improved when VH was included as a specimen for analysis in such cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This conclusion was strengthened by the experimental data in the present study (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, e), because the concentration of 6-MAM in VH exceeded the one in blood at a relatively early time point for 6-MAM, as compared with morphine as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, e.</p><p>The present results raise questions about the physiology of transfer of drugs from blood into VH. The entry of systemic administered drugs into the VH is prevented by different barriers, e.g., the blood-aqueous barrier and the blood-retina barrier (BRB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The penetration of drugs through membranes, including the BRB, depends on their size, shape, charge, and lipophilicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The flow is further governed by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure, as well as the concentration differences across the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The differences in penetration into VH observed between drugs have been attributed also to protein-binding of the drugs studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. VH is low in proteins, with only 1&#8211;3&#160;% of the total serum protein concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and we assume that there are no relevant differences between humans and pigs in this regard. The protein binding of morphine in pig and human plasma does not show significant differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>As seen in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a delay in diffusion was observed for all of the opioids under study, and especially for 6-MAM, its concentration in VH still increased after the concentration in blood became very low (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, e). Even though the mechanisms for this finding are not fully understood, some theories can be launched. It has been suggested that the cornea may act as a reservoir for drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; furthermore, some drugs might have an affinity for melanin pigment present outside the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], possibly both delaying and prolonging the distribution of drugs into different compartments of the eye (for reviews see Gaudana et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and B&#233;valot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]). In a study by Pitkanen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the most lipophilic beta blockers showed the highest permeability coefficients through the outer BRB; moreover, the longest VH diffusion time (permeation lag time) was seen for the most lipophilic drugs. They also suggested that this might be due to an increasing drug-melanin binding with increasing lipophilicity, because these drugs showed the greatest binding to melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Whether the theories mentioned above also apply to the opioids in this study is only speculative; however, the binding of opioids to melanin in hair has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Regarding the prolonged detection times for 6-MAM, it was previously suggested that esterases in VH showed lower activities and were more saturable as compared with those in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The mechanisms behind the decline in concentrations of morphine in VH have not previously been described, but it should be noted that prolonged detection times were observed for all of the metabolites.</p><p>How can our results assist in the practical interpretation of postmortem cases, considering the fact that drug concentrations in VH are expected to be subject to fewer postmortem changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]? If the approximate time frame between intake and death is known, the true antemortem blood concentration could be calculated based on the concentration in the VH. Often, a very high blood concentration of morphine is seen together with a low concentration in VH, which might represent the true antemortem situation if death occurred within the first hour after intake of heroin; however, if some hours had elapsed, which is often the case with heroin deaths, the true antemortem blood morphine concentration would be expected to be closer to or lower than the morphine concentration observed in the VH.</p><p>Based on the final measured concentrations and the half-lives of 6-MAM, in the present study, the expected detection time for 6-MAM in VH could be more than 20&#160;h in a living subject. Assuming limited postmortem changes in VH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the detection of 6-MAM in VH postmortem could indicate that death occurred as many as 20&#160;h or more after an intake of heroin. The dose and the LLOQ may, of course, influence this estimate. In postmortem cases, a negative 6-MAM in blood together with a positive 6-MAM in VH is often observed. In light of our findings, this could be explained by the considerably longer detection times for 6-MAM in VH as compared to those in blood. Because the present study also indicated longer detection times for morphine in VH, as compared to those in blood, it can be assumed that the detection times for other drugs are also longer in VH, as compared to those in blood.</p><p>It has previously been reported that a high blood/VH concentration ratio of drugs suggest rapid death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The results from the present study could argue that the detection of 6-MAM or morphine in VH indicates that death did not occur within the first hour after intake of heroin. This finding is, however, complicated by the fact that heroin is often used on a daily basis, and therefore, detections in VH could be caused by intake, for instance, on the day before.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report dealing with a pharmacokinetic study on heroin metabolites in VH using a living pig model. The pig resembles the human in both size and physiology except from minor metabolic species differences. To get pharmacokinetic data from VH samples, the present microdialysis sampling using the pig model is most recommended. Such data of heroin metabolites obtained from the blood and VH samples collected from living pigs gave an important clue for interpretation of antemortem heroin poisoning in human victims by the postmortem analysis of heroin metabolites in both blood and VH samples.
