In the present commentary, we assess whether a long-acting SN-38 prodrug, such as PLX038, might be efficacious in SG-resistant patients. We first describe possible mechanisms of action of SG, with new insights on pharmacokinetics and TROP2 receptor occupancy. We argue that SG is not an optimal conventional ADC and that the amount of systemic SN-38 spontaneously hydrolyzed from the ADC is so high it must have activity. Then, we describe the concept of time-over-target as related to the pharmacology of SG and PLX038 as SN-38 prodrugs. To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting that PLX038 or any SN-38 prodrug is superior to SG as an anticancer agent. Clearly, SG has the benefit over antigen-independent SN-38 prodrugs in that it targets cells with the TROP2 receptor. However, we surmise that PLX038 should be a more efficacious and less toxic prodrug of systemic SN-38 than SG. Finally, we suggest possible mechanisms of SG resistance and how PLX038 might perform in the context of each. Taken together, we argue that&#8212;contrary to many opinions&#8212;SG does not exclusively act as a conventional ADC, and propose that PLX038 may be efficacious in some settings of SG-resistance.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="d33e176"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par2">

The intended&#160;objective of the ADC&#160;was to deliver SN-38 to tumor cells abundant in TROP2 antigen. However, in contrast to conventional ADCs that have stable linkers and circulate for many days until internalization, SG contains a fast-cleaving linker that rapidly hydrolyzes in circulation to give SN-38 and free hRS7 with a half-life of only ~14 h in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The released SN-38 reaches very high systemic levels, so SG serves both as a short-lived ADC and as a systemic prodrug of SN-38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; however, it is unknown how much each mechanism contributes to its anti-cancer activity. SG has been remarkably effective in many clinical trials and is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pre-treated HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, the median progression-free survival is only ~ 6 months due to resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and there are limited rescue therapies available. Prolynx and Curie&#160; are planning a clinical trial of PLX038&#8212;a long-acting releasable PEG~SN-38 prodrug of SN-38&#8212;with patients whose triple negative breast cancer disease has progressed under&#160;SG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Commentary</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) Mechanisms, Pharmacokinetics, and Receptor Occupancy</title><p id="Par4">An understanding of the mechanisms of action of a drug are essential to understanding mechanisms of resistance and developing approaches to circumvent them. SG was designed as a canonical ADC targeting the extra-cellular antigen TROP2 that is present on many tumors. The intent was that after binding target cells expressing the antigen, the ADC would internalize and release its toxic SN-38 payload. However, with SG the conventional ADC mechanism is complicated by its rapid hydrolysis to give SN-38 and free hRS7 in the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; indeed, the amount of SN-38 released systemically is high enough to have systemic effects akin to traditional chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Although ADC efficacy is usually related to antigen expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], clinical experience has enigmatically found little correlation of efficacy of SG with TROP2 expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Due to the rapid release of SN-38, the ADC has a short 14-h half-life in the systemic circulation while the concomitantly released hRS7 has a long 102-h half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To our knowledge, the impact of the different lifetimes of these hydrolytic products of SG have largely gone unreported. The consequences we modeled from reported plasma pharmacokinetic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, which shows the levels of the drug-bearing SG, free hRS7, as well as the total SG plus hRS7 over three dosing cycles. As shown, there are increases in free hRS7 with subsequent doses due to the half-life of hRS7&#160;being long relative to the dosing interval. Importantly, the levels and duration of exposure of product hRS7 greatly exceed those of the parent ADC; here, over the 3-week cycle the AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> of hRS7 (70,800 h&#8226;&#956;g/mL) is about sixfold higher than SG (11,700 h&#8226;&#956;g/mL).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Human pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and product hRS7.

In contrast, the rapid rate of SG hydrolysis and production of the long-lived hRS7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] creates a situation where the ADC is greatly diluted and exceeded by hRS7 over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both SG and free mAb bind target TROP2 cells, but only the ADC is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, the effect of high levels of hRS7 is to compete with SG for TROP2 and greatly reduce the amount of ADC bound to TROP2 that internalizes and delivers its SN-38 cargo to the tumor. For example, after the first dose, SG represents only 12% of the total TROP2 binding Ab at day 2, and only 4% at day 3; after the second dose, the ADC is only 0.5% of the total TROP2 binding Ab 4 days later. Thus, although SG has the highest dosing regimen of any approved ADC, the levels and duration of exposure of the active ADC are remarkably low, and greatly exceeded by antigen-competitive hRS7.</p><p id="Par7">Assuming plasma pharmacokinetics qualitatively reflects tissue exposure, the important consequence of generating a high concentration of hRS7 is the reduction of TROP2 receptor occupancy by SG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the first dosing cycle the total ADC and equipotent hRS7 concentrations undergo a concentration transition from 1500 to 640 nM. At steady state the total mAb&#8212;SG plus hRS7&#8212;concentration greatly exceeds the TROP2 receptor and its nanomolar K<sub>d,</sub> and completely saturates the receptor. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the calculated fraction of TROP2 receptor occupied by the labile SG in the setting of continuous hRS7 formation, as well as a typical ADC with a stable linker. As indicated, &#8804;&#160;10% of TROP2 is occupied by SG for 80% of the dosing cycle. Clearly, the duration of TROP2 occupancy by SG is short, which limits the amount of ADC that can be internalized as well as the duration of internalized SN-38 inhibition of TOP1. In short, if there is minimal occupancy of TROP2 by SG throughout its dosing cycle, SG cannot be considered an optimal ADC.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>TROP2 receptor occupancy by sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and a stable antibody drug conjugate (ADC).

High maximum concentration (<italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub>) values can also contribute to toxicities.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par13">Thus, the most effective, least toxic administration is one where the drug is present at the target concentration, but not much above, for the longest period of time (i.e., longest TOT).</p><p id="Par14">The documented need for continuous inhibition of TOP1 to effect continuous inhibition of DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] emphatically suggests that TOP1 inhibition should follow the TOT hypothesis; that is, that low-dose, long TOT inhibition and prolonged exposure should be more efficacious than conventional high-intensity bolus treatments. Indeed, Houghton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that the efficacy of irinotecan&#8212;an SN-38 prodrug like PLX038&#8212;is schedule dependent and related to TOT: a given total dose of drug administered on a protracted schedule&#8212;two x 5-day courses every 21 days&#8212;was more efficacious than the same dose equivalents given as a single bolus. Higher dose intensity did not provide further benefit, but did increase toxicity&#8212;in accord with the TOT hypothesis. Moreover, in preclinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and in a large phase III pancreatic cancer trial, the efficacy of the liposomal irinotecan prodrug was directly associated with the duration of free SN-38 above a threshold&#8212;that is, the TOT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The SN-38 released from SG reaches concentrations exceeding that of any SN-38 prodrug, and we previously proposed that SG must be acting as a prodrug of SN-38 in addition to or instead of as an ADC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The structurally related labetuzumab govitecan, which contains the same unstable linker as SG, should also release SN-38, but the tumor targets likely have different sensitivities to SN-38. The rationale for this hypothesis with SG is as follows. In humans the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC values of SG are &gt; twofold and tenfold higher, respectively, than the SN-38 provided by irinotecan (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Since the SN-38 from irinotecan has significant anti-tumor activity, the much higher amount of free SN-38 released from SG must also have activity. It may be relevant that in six of six TROP2-containing human solid tumor lines the in vitro cytotoxicity of SN-38 exceeded that of SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], suggesting in vitro equivalence of the small molecule and ADC. Hence, the ability of SG as a prodrug for SN-38 should be considered a contributing source of its efficacy as well as toxicities.<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of SN-38 prodrugs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Schedule</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dose/3-week cycle mg/m<sup>2</sup></th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SN-38 equivalents/3-week cycle, mg/m<sup>2</sup></th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SN-38 <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, h</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SN-38 <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub>, nM</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TOT<sup>a</sup> % cycle</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SN-38 AUC, &#956;M&#8226;h</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Wasted AUC, %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">PLX-038</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">q3w</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1730</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">60<sup>b</sup></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">125</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">51</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">~&#160;70</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">9</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SG</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">qw x2, q3w</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">776<sup>c</sup></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">14</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">18</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">320</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">~&#160;48</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">92</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Irinotecan</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">q3w</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">340</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">21<sup>d</sup></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">~&#160;12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">140</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">~&#160;12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">88</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic toggle="yes">AUC</italic> area under the concentration time curve; <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">max</italic></sub> maximum concentration; <italic toggle="yes">q3w</italic> every 3 weeks; <italic toggle="yes">SG</italic> sacituzumab govitecan; <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">1/2</italic></sub> half-life; <italic toggle="yes">TOT</italic> time-over-target</p><p><sup>a</sup>Time over target assumed 5 nM target for SN-38 inhibition of TOP1</p><p><sup>b</sup>With losses due to renal elimination of the prodrug, the efficiency of delivery is 35% and actual SN-38 delivered is 21 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/cycle.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the SN-38 released from SG exceeds the target concentration for only 50% its 3-week cycle. Although this is ~&#160;fourfold longer than the SN-38 TOT from irinotecan, the TOT of the SN-38 from SG is significantly less that that from PLX038. And, DNA damage parallels TOP1 inhibition for periods exceeding 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The TOT hypothesis also posits that the amount of drug over the target concentration (&#8220;wasted AUC&#8221;)&#8212;~&#160;90% for SG and irinotecan&#8212;would not contribute to efficacy, but might to toxicity. The SN-38 released from PLX038 remains above the target concentration 70% of its 3-week dosing cycle, with only ~&#160;70% wasted AUC, so it should be effective and less toxic. Also, the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> of SN-38 has been directly associated with toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub> of the systemically released SN-38 from SG is &gt;&#160;sixfold higher than that from PLX038.</p><p id="Par18">Taken together, increasing the TOT of TOP1 inhibition through the use of long-acting SN-38 prodrugs such as PLX038 is expected to significantly increase the duration of DNA damage, and increase the probability of the released SN-38 being present during the sensitive S phase of the cell cycle. They should also be good candidates for use in combinations with drugs targeting DNA damage-response proteins&#160;such as PARP1 and ATR inhibitors. Finally, they should minimize on-target/off-tumor engagement and toxicity through reduction of SN-38 wasted AUC and<italic toggle="yes"> C</italic><sub>max</sub>. Hence, according to the TOT hypothesis, PLX038 should prove be a highly effective prodrug of SN-38.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>PLX038 may Overcome SG Resistance</title><p id="Par19">Resistance to SG may be related to development of mechanisms associated with ADC internalization or countering the cytotoxicity of SN-38. The most likely mechanisms of SG resistance include (1) mutations of TROP2 that reduce ADC internalization needed for cell-killing, (2) qualitative (mutations) and quantitative (low levels) alterations of TOP1 that reduce sensitivity to SN-38, and (3) over-expression of the transporter ABCG2 that causes SN-38 efflux from tumor cells.</p><p id="Par20">(1) Mutations of <italic toggle="yes">TROP2</italic> that reduce SG internalization could confer resistance because of the reduced intracellular SN-38 available for TOP1 inhibition or bystander effects. Indeed, Coates et al. recently reported that two of three tumors analyzed from a patient with acquired SG resistance emanated from either lowered expression or mutated <italic toggle="yes">TROP2</italic> that reduced binding to hRS7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. When the isolated <italic toggle="yes">TROP2</italic><sup>T256R</sup> mutant was reconstituted in TNBC or 3T3 cells it retained SG resistance but had no change in free SN-38 sensitivity.</p><p id="Par21">How does one reconcile the fact that cell uptake of SG requires TROP2 with the finding that the level of TROP2 expression on tumor did not impact efficacy in the TROPiCS-02&#160;trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Clearly, some level of TROP2 is necessary for SG efficacy since TROP2 absence or very low levels causes resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. One possibility is that the levels of TROP2 required for efficacy were already present in tumors assessed by H-score as &#8220;low&#8221; TROP2, so no stratification of clinical efficacy with TROP2 was observed. Another possibility is that retained efficacy of SG in low TROP2 tumors is due to released free SN-38 rather than the intact ADC. If the latter is correct, the potential superior prodrug properties of PLX038 versus SG might successfully treat patients with resistant tumors that have low or mutated TROP2.</p><p id="Par22">(2) Mutations of the TOP1 target of SN-38 could also confer resistance to SG. SN-38 resistant mutations of TOP1 are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and a <italic toggle="yes">TOP1</italic><sup>E418K</sup> somatic mutation of the TOP1 gene has been demonstrated in acquired SG -resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A SN-38 resistant TOP1 would not be expected to respond to a conventional prodrug of SN-38 such as PLX038.</p><p id="Par23">(3) Tumors frequently acquire resistance to TOP1 inhibitors by overexpression of the efflux transporter ABCG2, and inhibitors of this protein increase the efficacy of SG in resistant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The PEG~SN-38 prodrug ENZ-2208 overcomes ABCG2 resistance by accumulation in tumors by the EPR effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], after which the high local release and influx of SN-38 counteracts the efflux pump. The accumulation of ENZ-2203 is due to the 15 nm PEG nanomolecule carrier, which is the same in PLX038, so PLX038 should likewise overcome SN-38 resistance due to overexpression of ABCG2.</p><p id="Par24">Taken together, we posit that PLX038 would not be effective in tumors resistant to SG because of SN-38-resistant <italic toggle="yes">TOP1</italic> mutations, but may be in tumors with TROP2 defects or that overexpress drug efflux transporters. Hence, pre-treatment biopsies could identify mechanisms of resistance that might project efficacy or resistance to PLX038; if so, the information might ultimately lead to biomarker-defined patient selection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par25">It is confounding how a TROP2-mediated mechanism for SG can account for efficacy when there is no close correlation between TROP2 levels and efficacy; however, for a drug as important as SG, efficacy trumps understanding. We take a contrary view that an ADC mechanism may not be the only driver of SG efficacy and that systemic release of SN-38 plays an important role in efficacy and toxicity. The very high and long TROP2 occupancy by the released hRS7 that competes with the SN-38-conjugated SG also advocates a weakened conventional ADC mechanism. We believe PLX038 might provide rescue therapy for SG failures in two ways. First, assuming free systemic SN-38 is a major contributor to anti-tumor effects, we posit that PLX038 should be more efficacious as a SN-38 prodrug. Second, we suggest that PLX038 might overcome SG resistance in subsets of patients where resistance is due to a quantitative or qualitative defect in TROP2. Finally, as with a related PEG~SN-38 nanomolecule, tumor accumulation of the prodrug and high SN-38 influx may counteract resistance by efflux pumps. Hence, we posit that PLX038 could be effective in some SG-resistant tumors.</p><p id="Par26">To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting that PLX038 is superior to SG as an anticancer agent. We do opine that SG acts as both an antigen-specific ADC and as an antigen-independent prodrug of high levels of systemic SN-38. And, that the amount of systemic SN-38 spontaneously hydrolyzed from the ADC is so high it must have activity. We also assert that PLX038 is superior as a prodrug of SN-38 and, to the extent that systemic SN-38 contributes to efficacy, PLX038 could provide significant benefit. Finally, we posit that PLX038 might overcome some, but not all, mechanisms of SG resistance.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par27">No external funding was used in the preparation of this work.</p></notes><notes id="FPar2" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interests</title><p id="Par28">DVS and GWA are co-founders of Prolynx, which is developing PLX038.
