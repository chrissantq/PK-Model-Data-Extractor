In this study, we tested the hypothesis that acid resilience in the acidotic rabbit can be increased by enhancing the plasma availability of a naturally occurring volatile fatty acid, namely acetate. To ascertain the relative merits of the respiratory and renal systems in contributing to that resilience, we conducted our studies in non&#8212;ventilated and mechanically ventilated acidotic animals. Using ethanol as a feeder of acetate, and to counteract the antidiuretic effects of surgical interventions, we induced acidosis in anaesthetised rabbits, by intravenously infusing an acidified ethanolic dextrose solution. We observed very potent respiratory regulation of arterial blood pH coupled with a notable renal response by way of a 25-fold increase in urinary ammonium excretion in the non&#8212;ventilated group. In contrast, arterial blood pH plummeted much more rapidly in the mechanically&#8212;ventilated animals, but the compensated renal response was enormous, in the form of an 85 -fold increase in urinary ammonium output. Despite this significant adaptive renal response, the non -mechanically ventilated group of rabbits showed the greater acid resilience. This was attributed to an acetate stimulated flux through a series of metabolic pathways, generating supplementary buffer in the form of bicarbonate and ammonia, complemented by a robust respiratory response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetate</kwd><kwd>acidosis</kwd><kwd>ammonia</kwd><kwd>herbivore</kwd><kwd>hyperammonaemia</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>renal</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1 Introduction</title><p>The rabbit is an obligate nose breather. It respires mostly <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the activity of its diaphragm. It has a normal resting respiratory rate in the region of 30&#8211;60 breaths&#160;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and a minute volume of 0.25&#160;L&#160;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;Kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Nowland et al., 2015</xref>), which is approximately 3-fold higher than that found in humans. Because the rabbit&#8217;s respiratory rate can increase to at least 200 breaths&#160;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Schroeder and Smith, 2011</xref>), the capacity of this animal&#8217;s respiratory system to remove volatile acid is considerable, in comparison with man.</p><p>Although a monogastric herbivore, the rabbit is a known hindgut fermenter. The microbial fermentation of fodder in its hindgut produces large quantities of volatile fatty acids (VFA), most notably acetate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Blaxter, 1962</xref>). It is the most abundant VFA found in rabbit blood, where it exists in millimolar concentrations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bergman, 1990</xref>). Acetate reaches the liver in the portal circulation, where along with other VFA&#8217;s, it provides a large proportion of the energy requirements of the rabbit. Renal tubules and skeletal muscle of the rabbit have also been shown to have a high capacity to metabolize acetate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Blaxter, 1962</xref>, Dgelay et al., 1999). In addition to its role as an energy provider, acetate also fulfils a very important acid-base homeostatic function in the tissues of the rabbit, by virtue of its metabolic conversion into equimolar amounts of bicarbonate. The metabolic use of VFA&#8217;s, coupled with the intake of an alkaline ash diet, eliminates the non-volatile acidic burden on the kidneys of this species. The excretion of nutrient alkali, along with the net secretion of bicarbonate by the &#946;-intercalated cells in the cortical collecting ducts (CCD), gives normal rabbit urine its unique acid-base characteristics, which include a high titratable alkalinity, a pH in the zone of 8 &#177; 0.4, a milky appearance due to the precipitation of calcium salts at alkaline pH, and trace concentrations of ammonia (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Richterich et al., 1958</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and O'Donovan, 2019a</xref>).</p><p>The rabbit has been shown to have a very poor tolerance to systemic inorganic acid loading, in comparison to man, rodents, and canines (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Richterich et al., 1958</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bank, 1961</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Weiner et al., 2015</xref>). The susceptibility of the rabbit to non-volatile acid loads has been attributed to its renal incapacity to generate adequate amounts of ammonia buffer. The buffering of H<sup>+</sup> by the ammonia buffer, in preventing the urinary pH falling to &#8804; pH 4.5, facilitates the continued secretion of large quantities of excess H<sup>+</sup> into the collecting duct tubular fluid, while concurrently enabling the transport of equimolar quantities of HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> back into the blood plasma from the epithelial cells. In more recent times, scientists have observed that the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> synthesis of ammonia buffer can be significantly, though very modestly, increased through the infusion of inorganic phosphate (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and O'Donovan, 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and O'Donovan, 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Several key biochemical events have been proposed to collectively account for the very low rate of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> synthesis of ammonia by renal cortex cells in the acidotic rabbit. Firstly, the ability of rabbit kidney tubule cells to utilize glutamine as a substrate is relatively poor because of weak phosphate&#8212;dependent glutaminase activity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Richterich and Goldstein, 1958</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chauvin et al., 1997</xref>). Secondly, a low maximum velocity of the renal mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier within renal cells decreases the exit of malate from mitochondria, and consequently, decreases the upstream relief on the &#945;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes, resulting in a decrease in the rate of NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup> secretion into the tubular fluid (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cheema-Dhadli and Halperin, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Halperin and Cheema-Dhadli, 1980</xref>). Finally, the high glutamine synthetase activity, found in rabbit kidney nephrons (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chauvin et al., 1997</xref>), has been shown to trap ammonia as glutamine, thus rendering it unavailable for release into both the urine and the systemic circulation <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the renal vein. Furthermore, glutamine synthetase activity in herbivorous kidneys has been shown to be increased following the administration of ammonium chloride (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Michoudet et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Most acid-loading investigations in man and experimental animals have involved either the oral or intravenous administration of inorganic compounds such as ammonium chloride or hydrochloric acid. We became aware of a study by a research group (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Leonard and Orloff, 1955</xref>), who had used an unusual acid - loading cocktail, containing 5% dextrose, 3% ethanol, and 0.1&#160;M HCl, to induce metabolic acidosis in anaesthetized rats. We observed, however, that in rats infused with a solution containing 0.1&#160;M HCl in 0.9% NaCl (unpublished studies), urinary ammonium excretion was substantially lower in comparison to the data reported in the paper by <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Leonard and Orloff (1955)</xref>. Therefore, it became of great interest to us to determine if an acidified ethanolic dextrose solution, could have any significant impact on acid resilience, and urinary ammonium excretion, in an herbivorous species, such as the rabbit. Because the rabbit has a high resting minute volume, and the potential to expire large volumes of volatile acid under acidotic conditions, it was also decided to assess the renal response of acidotic rabbits, while they were under the control of mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><p>The ethical and animal husbandry procedures used in this study have been described in detail by us in a previous paper (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Walsh and O'Donovan, 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Ethical approval</title><p>The study was carried out at the Physiology Laboratories of the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) in Ireland.

In the case of the two groups of rabbits that were mechanically ventilated with room air, urinary ammonium excretion increased rapidly, and in a linear fashion, in response to an increased arterial blood acidity, until an arterial blood pH of 7.21 was reached, after which the ammonium excretion rate began to slow down (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the non&#8212;mechanically ventilated animals displayed a poorer correlation between the increase in urinary ammonium excretion and the increase in arterial blood acidity over the course of the acidification process. Furthermore, the speed and magnitude of the ammoniagenic response was considerably less, and the maximum urinary excretion rate of ammonium occurred at the much higher arterial blood pH of 7.28, in comparison with a mean value of pH of 7.21, that was noted in the two mechanically ventilated groups of animals. These notable differences between the two groups of rabbits highlight the very significant role that the respiratory system plays in this species, in controlling arterial blood pH. Through the mechanism of hyperventilation, the non&#8212;mechanically ventilated rabbits, receiving the acidified ethanolic&#8212;dextrose solution, were able to reduce the arterial blood pCO<sub>2</sub> in proportion to the declining buffering capacity of the plasma, which was the result of acid being intravenously infused, and non-volatile acidic compounds being formed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, due to the metabolism of ethanol. Even though the respiratory system was not incapacitated in the non&#8212;mechanically ventilated control group, receiving 0.9% NaCl +0.1&#160;M HCl, their inability to generate comparable amounts of plasma bicarbonate and urinary ammonia, would have accounted for their reduced buffering capacity and lower acid resilience (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

The metabolism of ethanol to acetate may provide the key to accounting for the increased acid resilience, that was observed by us.</p><p>The hepatic metabolism of ethanol to acetate in the rabbit involves three pathways.

Pharmacokinetic studies of acetate during ethanol oxidation in the rabbit showed that the fraction of a dose of ethanol converted to acetate was 0.54, and that the elimination of acetate followed a Michaelis&#8212;Menten kinetic model, with Vmax &amp; Km values of 40.8 &#177; 14.1&#160;mM&#160;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 0.47 &#177; 0.19&#160;mM, respectively (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fujimiya et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Like the kidneys of other species, the rabbit kidney has a high capacity to utilize acetate as a substrate (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chauvin et al., 1997</xref>). Following uptake by renal cells, acetate readily gains entry to mitochondria, and thereafter undergoes an intricate series of metabolic cycles during its metabolism, involving both the mitochondrion and cytosol (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chauvin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dugelay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Conjard et al., 2002</xref>). The oxidative metabolism of acetate would have generated considerable amounts of bicarbonate, which would have been returned to the blood stream, directly bolstering plasma bicarbonate levels. Furthermore, through the stimulation of proximal tubule ammoniagenesis, the metabolism of acetate would have facilitated the provision of ammonia base, that would have enabled the &#945;-intercalated cells in the collecting duct, increase the unloading of acid into the urine, while returning parallel amounts of additional bicarbonate to the blood stream. This hypothesis is supported by the observations of a French research group (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chauvin et al., 1997</xref>), who noted in <sup>13</sup>C NMR studies of rabbit kidney tubules, that acetate induced stimulation of flux through glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the oxidative deamination direction, increased &#945;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase catalysed reactions, whilst, at the same time, inhibiting flux through glutamine synthetase and the glutamate transamination pathways. As glutamate is a well-known end-product inhibitor of PDG, a reduction in intra-mitochondrial glutamate levels would also have favoured the activation of PDG, resulting in additional ammonia production by the proximal tubules. However, because of a relatively low renal PDG activity in the rabbit, the contribution of this pathway to ammoniagenesis would have been significantly less than <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> GDH.</p><p>Acid loading has been shown to induce renal carbonic anhydrase mRNA expression (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Tsuruoka et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA) is known to be influenced by the arterial blood pCO<sub>2</sub> status. For example, hypocapnia leads to a decrease renal H<sup>+</sup> secretion, while hypercapnia increases H<sup>+</sup> secretion by the kidneys. Evidence for this close inter-relationship was demonstrated in this study by the results showing that much higher urinary ammonium excretion rates were achieved in the mechanically ventilated rabbits in comparison to the non-ventilated animals, as both groups became acidotic. The intravenous infusion of the acidified ethanolic dextrose solution would have shifted the carbonic anhydrase catalysed reaction to the left, increasing the arterial blood pCO<sub>2</sub> in both groups. While the non-ventilated animals would have been able to hyperventilate and exhale the excess carbon dioxide, mechanical ventilation would have incapacitated this homeostatic mechanism.</p><p>An elevating extracellular pCO<sub>2</sub>, due either to intravenous acid loading, or the direct accumulation of volatile acid through respiratory inhibition, would have triggered a cascade of events inside the &#945;&#8212;intercalated cells. These would have included the activation of intracellular carbonic anhydrase by CO<sub>2</sub>, increasing the intracellular HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup>concentration, which in turn would have activated soluble adenyl cyclase (sAC) to produce cAMP, culminating, through the activity of phosphokinase A (PKA), in the insertion of vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase)&#8212;containing vesicles into the luminal cell membrane, facilitating increased H<sup>+</sup> secretion. The unloading of H<sup>+</sup> into the urine by the &#945;-intercalated cells would have been facilitated by the coordinated activities of key ammonia carriers (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Weiner and Verlander, 2017</xref>). On the basolateral side, Rhesus B and C glycoproteins (Rhbg) along with a Na<sup>+</sup>&#8212;K<sup>+</sup> ATPase would have enabled the uptake of NH<sub>4</sub>

The increased negativity of the tubular lumen would have stimulated the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) mediated secretion of K<sup>+,</sup> while the increased DCT fluid flow rate would have further increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion through the activation of the &#8220;big&#8221;/&#8220;maxi&#8221;&#8212;K<sup>+</sup> channels (BK) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Subramanya and Ellison, 2014</xref>). The outcome of K<sup>+</sup> hyper-secretion would be increased loss of K<sup>+</sup> in the urine, resulting in reduced plasma K<sup>+</sup> levels. Both hypokalemia and elevated plasma aldosterone levels would have further potentiated the proton&#8212;secreting and NH<sub>3</sub> transporter (Rhcg) activities of the &#945;-intercalated cells. It is thought that vasopressin, through its luminal V1a receptor, may play a critical role in mediating the stimulatory action of aldosterone in &#945;-intercalated cells, by facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic transport of its mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Izumi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the metabolism of acetate, through directly boosting plasma HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> levels, coupled with indirectly facilitating enhanced net acid excretion by enhancing ammoniagenesis and urinary ammonia excretion, would have contributed immensely to delaying the impact of the intravenous acid loading process on the rabbit&#8217;s blood acid-base status. These metabolic factors, coupled with the robust nature of the rabbit&#8217;s respiratory system, would have contributed enormously to the increased systemic acid tolerance that was particularly demonstrated by the non&#8212;ventilated group of rabbits, in this study.</p><p>The very high urinary ammonium excretion rates reported in this study of acidotic rabbits have not previously been observed by other investigators. As acetate appears to mediate substantial renal production of ammonia in acidosis, it would be most important, in a future study, to examine if acetate induces a hyperammonaemia. To quantify such potential toxicity would be most important to ensure the safe use of acetate as a parenterally administered buffer in human medicine.</p><p>In terms of the rabbit as an herbivore, this study has demonstrated that this species does have its own unique physiological machinery, by way of its high respiratory minute volume and urinary ammonia buffer generating capacity, to be able to deal with high organic acid loads, originating either from acetate or lactate, both of which are known to be readily metabolised to equimolar concentrations of bicarbonate. The dominant nature of the rabbit&#8217;s respiratory system appears to reduce the magnitude of its renal response to an acid load, and in so doing, may account, in part, for the relatively very low urinary ammonium excretion values normally found in this acidotic species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I wish to express my sincere thanks to the late D.J.
