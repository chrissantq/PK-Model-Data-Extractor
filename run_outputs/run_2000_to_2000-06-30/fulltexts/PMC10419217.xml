The highly invasive and metastasis of tumor cells increase the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, so people pay more and more attention to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Conventional treatment methods, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are difficult to eliminate tumor cells completely. And the emergence of nanotechnology has boosted the efficiency of tumor diagnosis and therapy. Herein, the research progress of nanotechnology used for tumor diagnosis and treatment is reviewed, and the emerging detection technology and the application of nanodrugs in clinic are summarized and prospected. The first part refers to the application of different nanomaterials for imaging <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and detection <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, which includes magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging and biomarker detection. The distinctive physical and chemical advantages of nanomaterials can improve the detection sensitivity and accuracy to achieve tumor detection in early stage. The second part is about the nanodrug used in clinic for tumor treatment. Nanomaterials have been widely used as drug carriers, including the albumin paclitaxel, liposome drugs, mRNA-LNP, protein nanocages, micelles, membrane nanocomplexes, microspheres et al., which could improve the drug accumulate in tumor tissue through enhanced permeability and retention effect to kill tumor cells with high efficiency. But there are still some challenges to revolutionize traditional tumor diagnosis and anti-drug resistance based on nanotechnology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>nanomaterials</kwd><kwd>tumor imaging</kwd><kwd>biomarker detection</kwd><kwd>tumor therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China

According to World Health Organization&#8217;s estimates, approximately 10 million individuals pass away globally each year due to cancer. Low income countries and middle-income countries account for a large proportion, and the incidence rate is rising rapidly (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Tavallaii et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>According to the investigation, malignant tumors can be detected by physical examination, which can prevent their further deterioration in a timely manner. Tumor cells are highly invasive and metastatic, making detection difficult. Most tumor cells are only discovered at a late stage. So far, several imaging techniques have been used for tumor diagnosis, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound imaging (USI). However, these techniques have certain limitations, for example, the low spatial resolution of CT (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>). MRI provides high-resolution anatomical images, but its sensitivity is low and tissue penetration is poor (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Montiel Schneider and Lassalle, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Commonly used treatment methods include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Surgical resection is recognized as the preferred choice for treating solid tumors. Given the limitations of tumor resection, additional methods will be used to assist in targeting tumor residues (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are relatively important treatment methods, but there are also many side effects, such as toxicity, drug resistance, and a high probability of late recurrence (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Along with the deep understanding of cancer, more and more studies have begun to focus on the application of nanotechnology for tumor theranostic. The application of nanotechnology in diagnostic and therapeutic applications holds bright prospects. Nanomedicine can enhance the bioavailability of drugs, reduce side effects and extend the duration of drug effectiveness <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Teja et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). New nanomedicine is constantly being applied in the clinic. Nanotechnology has also made new breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis. Utilizing nanoimaging technology, the sensitivity can be significantly improved, offering the possibility of early detection and timely treatment of cancer. Based on the physical properties of nanomaterials, their applications are becoming more and more extensive. In the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, nanotechnology is seen as a more convenient, highly targeted delivery system with fewer side effects (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gulia et al., 2023</xref>). At present, there are still many potential problems with nanotechnology in cancer diagnosis and treatment. This paper reviews the clinical applications of various nanomedicines and their applications in the field of tumor diagnosis and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Application of nanotechnology in tumor detection</title><p>With the emergence and development of nanotechnology, the small size advantage of nanocarriers can be used to harnessed to enable drugs to engage in nano-level interactions with cells, thereby enhancing the precision of tumor diagnosis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).

<italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> imaging is a powerful strategy in life science research and medical diagnosis. People could better understand the occurrence and development of diseases. The technology is now widely used in the field of oncology. The combination of imaging technology with nanomaterials has led to new breakthroughs in magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>2.1.1 Magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>MRI is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities for tumors, but its image resolution is low. The use of contrast agents such as magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can effectively solve this problem. MNPs are nanoscale particles centered on a magnetic material and encapsulated in a biopolymer core-shell structure. MNPs has the advantages of both magnetic materials and nanoparticles. They have the advantages of large surface area, strong magnetic responsiveness, high adsorption capacity, good biocompatibility, and easy manipulation by external magnetic fields (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Eivazzadeh-Keihan et al., 2021</xref>). In the field of tumor-imaging, biomolecule-coated small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) and ultramicroscopic paramagnetic iron oxides (USPIOs) have been widely used as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for cancer imaging detection. Subsequently, more MNPs for tumor diagnosis have been explored through ongoing in-depth studies. In a study conducted by <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Rezayan et al. (2016)</xref>, the impact of nanoparticles used as contrast agents in MRI was explored. SPIOs were synthesized by co-precipitation method according to the synthetic route (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The nanoparticles that have undergone modifications exhibit superparamagnetic properties, and they are well-dispersed and highly stable in water. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that iron oxide nanoparticles modified with amino acids are the most efficient contrast agents for MRI. In a study performed by <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Eivazzadeh-Keihan et al. (2021)</xref>, MNPs were subjected to modifications using various materials such as carbon-based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, synthetic and natural polymers, antibodies, biomolecules, and amphiphilic polymers. The research highlight that the adsorption mechanism of magnetic nanoparticles is influenced by their size, surface energy and charge. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity of magnetic nanoparticles is a crucial factor in influencing the selectivity of protein binding and separation processes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-DPA-PEG-COOH.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fbioe-11-1249875-g001.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>2.1.2 Fluorescence imaging</title><p>FI is an important modality for tumor detection. It is an indispensable instrument in both physiological and pathological research and drug development. In recent years, nanomaterials have many applications in FI for tumor detection, such as inorganic quantum dots (QDs).</p><p>QDs refer to be aggregates composed of a certain number of atoms in a certain way, which can be used to display the distribution and concentration of biomarkers in tissues. QDs have exceptional optical characteristics such as high brightness, strong stability and the ability to perform multiplexing, so they are expected to be a promising optical detector (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>). The surface of QDs can be modified to enable object localization imaging. <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2023d)</xref> used a simple strategy to combine Mn: ZnS QDs, and TEMPO-CNFs to detect different types of biological molecules. The biosensor is portable and accurate, make it a valuable tool in fluorescence detection, not only for the targeted substances but also potentially for other compounds in samples. It is expected to provide new ideas for environmental monitoring and biomedical diagnosis.</p><p>Carbon quantum dots (CQD) are fluorescent carbon nanoparticles with promising applications in cell imaging and bioimaging due to their photoluminescent properties. Through the use of photobleaching treatment, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2019)</xref> synthesized highly stable fluorescent carbon quantum dots (FCQDs) and obtain fluorescence images at different time intervals. The FCQDs exhibited fluorescence 5&#160;min after administration and accumulated at the tumor sites after 3&#160;h. The authors reported that the total accumulation in tumors was observed at 12&#160;h and this extended the imaging period. The researchers also found that the FCQDs efficiently accumulated in tumors, kidneys, and liver based on anatomical images of mouse organs. However, there was no detection of fluorescent signal in organs such as the heart, lung, and spleen. Experiments involving <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> cell imaging and bioimaging demonstrated that the FCQDs exhibited excellent bioimaging properties, low cytotoxicity, and antioxidant activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>2.1.3 Photoacoustic imaging</title><p>PAI is an advanced technology that integrates ultrasound imaging with optical imaging systems, offering both precise spatial resolution and enhanced contrast. But the resolution of photoacoustic imaging is influenced by many factors. Photoacoustic imaging and gold nanoparticles can be used in combination to achieve more accurate biomedical imaging. Gold (Au) is one of the most chemically stable elements, and Au nanomaterials have good biocompatibility. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are easily adsorbed on other biomaterials (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Li H. et al., 2022</xref>), and the surface is always covered with protectant molecules. These molecules are used to interact with specific reagents in order to generate certain functional groups with special functions. With this property, AuNPs can be chemically modified and applied to imaging analysis, tumor detection and other fields. In particular, surface passivators, such as protein and peptide capped gold nanoparticles, are widely used for imaging (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Shelar et al., 2023</xref>). <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2022)</xref> constructed a core-shell integrated diagnostic and therapeutic nano-system of gold nanodots-paclitaxel-polylysine (AuNDs PTX-PLL) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). AuNDs and PTX are encapsulated in PLL, with a size of around 30&#160;nm to facilitate the enrichment of nanoparticles in tumors. Besides, AuNDs can be used for PAI. Given the direct relationship between the concentration of AuNDs and the imaging effect, it becomes feasible to employ them for quantitative analysis. For optimal results, an AuNDs concentration of 1&#8211;1.5&#160;mg/mL is recommended, as the signal strength remains relatively consistent within this range. The utilization of AuNDs enables non-invasive and real-time monitoring of drug delivery and release procedures, showcasing their potential for valuable clinical applications.</p><fig position="float" id="F2" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>The procedure involved in producing AuNDs-PTX-PLL and its utilization for responsive drug release in chemotherapy applications.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fbioe-11-1249875-g002.jpg"/></fig><p>PAI has become a research hotspot and researchers need to develop ideal nanoparticle transport systems to work with this imaging technology. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye, which is one of the most commonly used PAI agents. <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Thangavel et al. (2022)</xref> added dehydrated ethanol to human serum albumin aqueous solution, and synthesized ICG-PTX nanoparticles by using a desolvation process. ICG-PTX nanoparticles are being used to guide drug delivery targeting CD44-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The size of the nanoparticle is about 315.24&#160;nm and the PDI is less than 0.3. HA (hyaluronic acid) -functionalized-ICG-PTX-loaded nanoparticles had strong PAI average strength signal with nanoparticles excited by light with a wavelength of 806&#160;nm. The maximum PAI intensity was obtained with a detection signal depth of about 10&#160;mm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>2.1.4 Ultrasonic imaging</title><p>USI involves the transmission and reception of ultrasound waves, which encounter varying levels of impedance depending on the tissue they pass through, resulting in different degrees of transmission and reflection at the boundaries between different tissues. Examining the reflected signal can provide insights into the internal structure of bodily tissues.</p><p>
<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al. (2022)</xref> created a type of gold-based nanocarriers called PGMP-siRNA NPs, which were specifically designed to carry small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting STAT6, with a particle size of about 200&#160;nm (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> experiments, PGMP-siRNA NPs had strong absorption of light in the wavelength range of 600&#8211;900&#160;nm. It can efficiently transform near-infrared light into thermal energy and regulated the temperature by controlling the laser power. In the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) mode, the PGMP-siRNA NPs exhibited remarkable improvement in echo intensity. It displayed uniform fine point ultrasonic echo, and the echo was enhanced with the increase of nanocore concentration. Based on their superior ultrasound imaging performance, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> USI of nanoparticles has been characterized. Tumor sites in PGMP-siRNA NPs-treated mice were significantly enhanced in CEUS mode compared to the control group. These findings provide further validation of the potential of nanoparticles in advancing contrast imaging techniques. <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al.

The nanoparticles have an approximate size of around 200&#160;nm. In the CEUS test, the MSNsiRNA@PVA NPs echo enhancement is evident, showing a uniform fine-dot high echo. MSN-siRNA@PVA NPs was compared with SonoVue, a commonly used clinical ultrasound contrast agent, to produce similar contrast enhancement at the same concentration (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

</title><p>In tumor detection, the conventional approach is to confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy, which is invasive and costly for the patient. Exosomes are ideal analytical targets for liquid biopsies because of the capacity of carrying genetic molecules (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). High quality, low-cost nanosensors are a promising method for exosome protein detection. Compared with other methods, exosomes exhibit excellent performance in biological analysis, including liquid biopsy (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Zhang L. et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2023b</xref>). Nanosensors are typically made of metal or semiconductor nanoparticles whose surfaces are modified with specific biomolecule recognition molecules (e.g., antibodies or nucleic acids) that allow them to bind selectively to the target biomolecule. <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kuznetsov et al. (2022)</xref> explored a cost-efficient approach to create fluorescent nanosensors utilizing semiconductor nanocrystals. The sensor has excellent photostability and can be used for <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> diagnosis of c-Met positive cells. It exhibits high binding efficacy to the target antigen present on the cell surface and can be utilized for molecular profiling of tumor tissue. The resulting product is expected to be useful for biomarker visualization. <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ganesh et al. (2022)</xref> designed a self-functionalized nanosensor capable of pathologically identifying metastatic cancer at an early stage and predicting the likelihood of metastatic cancer onset. By attaining a sensitivity rate of 98%, this approach successfully meets the requirements for early detection and prognosis of cancer metastasis through the identification of metastasis-initiating cells (MIC). It demonstrates a remarkable specificity of 99.62% in distinguishing MIC within a diverse population of tumor-initiating cells. Additionally, the predictive accuracy of the MIC assay as a biomarker for metastasis in heterogeneous tumor spheres is 84.6%. In general, this technique is highly relevant for the early identification of metastatic tumors. A near-infrared fluorescent biosensor called &#945;-Fuc-DCM was created by <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Zhang J. et al. (2022)</xref> to enable the quick and ratiometric monitoring of &#945;-L-fucosidase (AFU) activity in cells and mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The role of nanomaterials in tumor therapeutic tools can be briefly summarized into two aspects: the first is the direct fabrication of drug molecules into nanoscale particles to address the poor dispersion and high toxicity of existing drugs, such as nanocrystalline drugs; second, nanomaterials are used as drug delivery systems (including albumin paclitaxel, liposome drugs, mRNA-LNP, protein nanocages, micelles, membrane nanocomplexes) for drug delivery.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>3.1 Drug nanocrystal</title><p>In the past few years, an increasing number of scientists have centered their attention on utilizing targeted and controlled-release nanotechnology in the therapy of cancer. with nanocrystalline drugs in the spotlight. Nanocrystals do not require carrier materials. The system is comprised of submicron particles made entirely from drugs, which are arranged in a colloidal dispersion, and there are no limitations on the encapsulation rate. Nanocrystalline drugs often exist as crystalline dispersed particles, and when in liquid form, they are known as nanocrystalline suspensions, which can be defined as nanoparticles made of pure drugs. This is a general formulation method that can improve the delivery efficiency of hydrophobic drugs.

The study also investigated the impact of these CST nanoparticles (CNPs) on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition. Results showed that CNPs were effective in inhibiting P-gp expression and preventing drug efflux by inducing HSF-1 expression and promoting nuclear translocation of HSF-1. The study also found that CNPs promoted apoptosis of newly established doxorubicin (DOX) resistant cell (MCF-7/ADR) by activating the ROS/ERK/JNK signaling pathway, compared to free CST. Moreover, CNPs showed significant inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MCF-7/ADR spheroids, confirming their potential to reverse drug resistance. These findings demonstrated that CNPs have the capability to serve as a translational nanomedicine for addressing drug resistance in cancer treatment.

The findings revealed that CST/DOX NPs had a substantial impact on the water solubility of CST and led to an enhanced accumulation of the drug in MCF-7/ADR cells by activating HSF-1 expression and suppressing P-gp expression through the NF-&#954;B pathway. Additionally, the study discovered that CST/DOX NPs triggered apoptosis and autophagy in MCF-7/ADR cells via the ROS/JNK signaling pathway. Furthermore, CST/DOX NPs exhibited significant accumulation and infiltration capabilities in MCF-7/ADR multicellular spheroids (MCs) and had a notable inhibitory effect on MCF-7/ADR MCs.

Biodegradable polymer microspheres possess the aforementioned advantages. These microspheres not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility but can also be prepared as sustained or controlled release formulations according to needs. Furthermore, their particle size distribution is narrow, eliminating the need for screening of improperly sized microspheres in later stages. As a result, this characteristic reduces raw material waste and lowers preparation costs. Additionally, microspheres demonstrate good batch-to-batch reproducibility and repeatable release behavior, showcasing significant clinical value (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Microsphere formulations belong to the high-end and complex field of pharmaceutical development, with a higher threshold. There is relatively little homogeneous competition in the pharmaceutical market for such formulations. For most drugs, there is a significant market capacity and room for growth, making their commercial prospects vast.</p><p>Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) formulations consist of different types, such as microspheres, <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> gel systems, and solid implants, and are commonly utilized for controlled and sustained drug release (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Li X. et al., 2022</xref>).

Sorafenib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be taken orally, and it targets multiple receptors. The drug is capable of suppressing the proliferation of tumor cells, hindering angiogenesis, and promoting apoptosis of tumor cells. Sorafenib is primarily utilized to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma. <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Li et al.

The size of these microspheres is approximately 73.5 &#177; 8.3&#160;&#956;m, with encapsulation efficiencies of 68.7% &#177; 1.9% for SOR and 76.5% &#177; 2.3% for CAT. The combined application of SOR and CAT demonstrates a significant synergistic effect in promoting cancer cell apoptosis while causing minimal damage to surrounding normal cells. During <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments, SOR-CAT-PLGA microspheres were found to fill tumor blood vessels effectively, impede neovascularization, and result in the shrinkage of tumor volume or prompt necrosis in rabbits. Moreover, these microspheres also downregulate the expression of PD-L1, suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell apoptosis, and elevate IFN-&#947; levels. Therefore, the combined use of SOR and CAT may be an effective treatment method for liver cancer.</p><p>Porous microspheres (pMS) possess a large specific surface area and excellent adsorption performance, with interconnected inner and outer channels. pMS have broad application prospects in gastric retention drug delivery, pulmonary targeting drug delivery, high-speed chromatography, tissue regeneration scaffold development, and serving as carriers for biopharmaceuticals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh Dastidar et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the low density and light weight of pMS, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al.

They loaded AFT lipid nanoparticles (AFT-SLN) and PTX into PLGA-pMS, creating AFT-SLN-PTX-pMS. This microsphere complex exhibited two distinct drug release phases, with PTX releasing faster than AFT. The aerodynamic properties of AFT-SLN-PTX-pMS were found to be favorable, with an MMAD value of about 3.25&#160;&#181;m, indicating successful deposition in the alveolar region of the lungs. According to pharmacokinetic parameters, both drugs maintained high concentrations within 96&#160;h and were predominantly concentrated in the lungs. Additionally, the combination of the two drugs showed synergistic effects, with PTX significantly enhancing the cancer cell growth inhibitory effect of AFT. Moreover, AFT&#8217;s sustained release inhibited cancer cell migration. These results suggest that AFT-SLN-PTX-pMS can evade phagocytic cells and achieve prolonged retention in the lungs. This drug delivery system demonstrates passive lung targeting characteristics, enhancing tumor killing efficacy while reducing systemic side effects.</p><p>Tumor treatment is a long-term process, and direct injection of drugs into the tumor presents a promising approach. Some drugs have been attempted to be administered directly into tumor tissues. However, these drugs have poor retention at the administration site and may leak out of the tumor within a few hours. This significantly affects drug efficacy and may increase systemic toxicity of the medication (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#241;oz et al., 2021</xref>). Drug depot technology may be a potential approach to address these issues. Drugs diffuse and gradually release within a polymer matrix, (such as PLA or PLGA). However, the stability of sensitive drugs may be impacted by the properties of the polymer matrix, including its hydrophobic nature, internal pH, and reactive functional groups (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lessmann et al., 2023</xref>). Thermosensitive hydrogel is a drug delivery system whose physical state changes with temperature. By enhancing the adhesiveness of drugs to the affected area and prolonging local residence time, thermosensitive hydrogels can effectively improve drug bioavailability (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). Gel solutions undergo a phase transition with changes in environmental temperature and quickly solidify to block blood vessels, thereby cutting off the blood supply to tumors. Additionally, it can effectively address issues of embolism caused by non-uniform sizes of lipids and microspheres. Compared to common tumor treatment approaches, thermosensitive hydrogels can serve as drug depots for controlled release of drugs and targeted delivery into tumor tissues. The irregular shape of the affected area in tumor treatment poses challenges for drug administration, making thermosensitive hydrogels an ideal drug carrier (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Yan, 2021</xref>).</p><p>

Then, the mice in the group that received laser irradiation and were given Cur-MP/IR820 experienced high temperatures (approximately 51&#176;C) at the tumor site, leading to tumor elimination. Subsequently, the platform continued to release Cur, killing the remaining cancer cells and promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts and calcium deposition. The Cur-MP/IR820 hydrogel platform offers a promising avenue for the treatment of bone tumors and the regeneration of bone tissue, thereby providing a source of inspiration for future research in this area.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4"><title>4 Conclusion</title><p>The development of nanotechnology has provided an excellent platform for tumor diagnosis, tumor cell imaging, early prevention and targeted therapy. The introduction of nanomaterials has provided novel functional technologies for the early diagnosis and treatment of major diseases such as cancer. In this paper, we have summarized the progress of nanotechnology in the early diagnosis of tumors, including the development status of nanomaterials for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> imaging techniques. The challenges and future directions of nanoprobe technology in image-guided oncology diagnostics are discussed, as well as the prospects for the development of biosensors for high sensitivity detection of tumor biomarkers. They have their advantages, such as magnetic nanoparticles that can be used as medical contrast agents for increased sensitivity, nanocrystalline QDs with high stability, and gold nanoparticles with low toxicity. These nanoparticles enable ultra-fast, highly sensitive and highly selective detection and diagnosis. At the same time, however, these tumor detection techniques suffer from several drawbacks, such as the large amount of residual nanoprobes in the body, and the possibility of cell death, oxidative stress and inflammation, among other side effects, due to too long residence time.</p><p>Conventional cancer therapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies all come with their own set of limitations, including resistance, systemic toxicity and rapid elimination rates. New modalities of cancer treatment may be combined with nanotechnology to alter the status of treatment with excessive systemic chemotherapy. There is a growing clinical focus on the application of nanotechnology with targeted and slow-release properties to conventional oncology treatments, with nanomedicine being the leading candidate.</p><p>Nanomedicines for the treatment of tumors are generally natural nanomedicines, polymeric nanodrug carriers, and nanoliposomes. The emergence of emerging Nab-P, mRNA-LNP, protein nanocages, micelles, membrane-nanoparticle composites and microspheres has solved many problems in clinical cancer prevention and treatment. Nevertheless, there exist certain obstacles in the practical implementation of these nanomedicines in clinical settings. The instability of the phospholipid component of liposomal drugs has hampered the translation of liposomal research into clinical practice for more than 50&#160;years. The emergence of mRNA-LNP has represented a significant advancement in cancer prevention, yet there is still ample scope for enhancing LNP effectiveness. This can be accomplished through the refinement of lipid composition and customizing LNPs to cater to specific objectives. Cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanoparticles have shown great potential for cancer targeted therapies due to their superior molecular identification specificity and cancer cell targeting. However, there is still a lack of key indicators that can assess the quality of these bio-inspired nanoparticles and the resulting therapeutic effects. Additionally, only a few of these nanoparticles have received clinical approval due to their toxicity, immunogenicity and reticuloendothelial system isolation. Microsphere formulations are a type of sustained-release drug delivery system that can stably release drugs over a prolonged period. They are mainly used for diseases that require frequent dosing, such as cancer and psychiatric disorders. This drug delivery system can significantly improve the bioavailability of drugs and patient compliance. However, the development and production of microsphere formulations are challenging, and there are high barriers to entry in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the development of corresponding technologies. There is no denying that nanotechnology will play an important role in the future of medicine, but there are many aspects of nanotechnology that are not yet perfect. For nanotechnology to benefit humanity, further exploration by relevant researchers is needed.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>YY and ML: Collection, writing original draft.
