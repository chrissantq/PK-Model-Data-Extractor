By using an in vitro corneal epithelial cell model combined with a tear replenishment method, this study aimed to investigate the delivery of the glaucoma drug latanoprost from contact lenses and compare the dynamic release results to no-replenishment (immersion) conditions. Corneal epithelial cells were grown as a monolayer or multilayer on curved cellulose cell culture inserts. Three contact lens materials (balafilcon A; senofilcon A; etafilcon A), soaked for 24&#160;h in latanoprost, were placed on the curved cornea models (CCM) and drug concentration was determined on the basal (diffusion/transport) and apical (supernatant) sides after 1, 4, 8 and 12&#160;h. The in vitro tear replenishment was achieved via intermittent flow of a tear solution over the CCM at a rate of 1&#160;mL/hour. A zero-order kinetic was observed for basal drug concentration over the 12&#160;h period. Similar basal and apical drug concentrations were observed with monolayer and multilayer CCM, except for the etafilcon A material. The apical release of latanoprost was significantly lower under replenishment compared to no-replenishment conditions. These results demonstrate the role that a dynamic release model will have in predicting the amount of drug that can be released from a contact lens into the tear film and the critical role of a cell monolayer in in vitro drug delivery studies.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

In vitro human cornea models offer a cost effective and more standardizable substitute to animal studies, which can be costly and may be difficult to interpret given both interspecies variation and animal-to-animal inconsistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Several cell culture models of the cornea and corneal epithelium have been used to study in vitro ocular toxicity and permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Reconstructed cornea equivalents, which include all corneal layers have been shown to correlate reasonably well with in vivo results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it is recognized that the epithelium, through its tight junctions, acts as the primary barrier against transcorneal permeation and is also responsible for 99% of the corneal electrical resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The corneal epithelium alone could thus be considered as a good proxy for an in vitro ocular drug model for contact lens delivery as it can reduce cell culture cost and time, and allow for higher throughput testing of biomaterial interactions and drug permeation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, besides reproducing the barrier function of the epithelium in vitro, corneal epithelial cells express several membrane receptors and also contain enzymes, both of which are involved in transport and metabolization of prodrugs, such as latanoprost, a widely-used anti-glaucoma medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Human corneal epithelial cells express high levels of prostaglandin transporters OATP2A1 (Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2A1) which contributes to the transcellular transport of latanoprost, a prostaglandin F2<italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic> analogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">To evaluate ocular drug delivery systems and new drugs, in vitro cell models such as Franz and Bronaugh cells have been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a Franz cell, the drug solution diffuses from the donor chamber through the excised corneal tissue or an in vitro cornea model into the receptor chamber where samples of the drug are collected. The stirring prevents formation of a stagnant boundary transfer layer. While steady-state permeability experiments enable assessment of corneal permeability, metabolism and active transport of the drug, it does not account for the rapid elimination of the drug in the tear film. Understanding the pre-corneal elimination kinetics, as well as distribution and elimination in the anterior chamber of the eye, when combined with permeability studies may lead to the development of optimized drug delivery systems and the successful simulation of in vivo drug diffusion through the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar to the in vitro ocular permeability models, in vitro biocompatibility and toxicology models currently do not remove/replenish nutrients on the corneal epithelial cells during incubation, and thus cells are exposed to the same concentration over an extended period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">An in vitro tear replenishment system (TRS) was previously developed to deliver a tear solution analogue to an in vitro ocular cell culture model and the ophthalmic material interacting with the ocular cell model while maintaining the air&#8211;liquid interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, it was observed that maintaining higher flow rates with the &#8220;atomized jet design&#8221; could damage the integrity of the cornea model over long periods of time and thus prevented its use for biocompatibility and drug delivery studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The TRS was redesigned to include (1) a dripping flow regime which allowed for longer time study and (2) the collection of the supernatant from each well/ocular model for analysis. The new TRS model, presented here, was used to investigate the effect of tear replenishment on the release of latanoprost from three commercially available contact lens materials. Latanoprost was chosen as the model drug in this study, as the hydrolysis of latanoprost prodrug by corneal epithelial cells before diffusion through the cornea is an important factor to consider in evaluating drug delivery systems in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

In the human eye, the drug released from an ophthalmic material is first dissolved in the tear film with a limited volume before it diffuses through the corneal epithelium. Our in vitro model enables to characterize the release profile and amount of drug diffusion under more physiological conditions. Furthermore, comparing the apical release between replenishment and immersion (no- replenishment) conditions as well as basal release highlighted how this dynamic in vitro cell culture model may help in gaining a better understanding of the role that tear replenishment plays in the human eye and inform the design and testing of drug delivery biomaterials.</p><p id="Par30">In the case of drug release studies in a dynamic system, in comparison to the immersion/no-replenishment in vitro model, two different mechanisms may occur:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par31">the in vitro drug release may be elevated compared to the immersion model; this would be due to the high solubility of the drug in the tear solution, being washed away and drained by the TRS, as it would be in tears through the lacrimal system, or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">the in vitro drug release may decrease due to the low solubility of the drug in the tear solution resulting in lower concentration of the drug being released into a much smaller residual tear liquid, especially between the contact lens and the corneal cells, as might be the case in the tear film between the epithelium and the contact lens (post-lens tear film).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par33">The first proposed mechanism may be the more dominant effect for hydrophilic ophthalmic drugs while the second mechanism would be the predominant effect for hydrophobic compounds such as latanoprost. The considerably high drug uptake and low drug release from the silicone hydrogel lenses can be attributed to the higher affinity of the hydrophobic latanoprost to the relatively hydrophobic silicone hydrogel material (as would be the case with proposed mechanism #2). Comparing the results obtained using the two conditions (replenishment versus no-replenishment) showed the dominant effect of the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the contact lens material, resulting in a reduced apical drug loss into the supernatant. Etafilcon A showed marginally less affinity toward latanoprost when compared to the silicone hydrogels (see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This resulted in increased drug release on the apical area and diffusion into the basal side. This is consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], where a significantly higher amount of drug release was observed from high water content hydrogel contact lenses such as etafilcon A. This can be attributed to the bulk properties of such materials and their relatively lower affinity towards highly hydrophobic compounds such as latanoprost.</p><p id="Par34">The significantly elevated latanoprost release on the apical side in the immersion model was in spite of the considerably lower volume of supernatant fluid in the immersion model (2<italic toggle="yes">.</italic>5<italic toggle="yes">&#160;mL</italic> vs. 12<italic toggle="yes">&#160;mL</italic>). This phenomenon can be explained if one were to consider the role that live cells play in transporting and hydrolyzing the prodrug. Previous studies proved the crucial role of live cells in latanoprost&#8217;s release from contact lens material and its diffusion through a cornea model in an immersion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Due to the hydrophobicity of the latanoprost, it may easily penetrate through the transcellular pathways into corneal cells where it will be hydrolyzed into the free-acid form. In the case of the monolayer curved cornea model, the free-acid drug may leave the cell membrane to either the apical or basal side. The limited post contact lens tear film volume present in the replenishment conditions would inhibit apical diffusion of the latanoprost free-acid, while in the immersion conditions, the apical release would be promoted. One may further hypothesize that in the multilayer curved cornea model, where hydrolysis of the prodrug may occur in lower layers, the basal or apical release of latanoprost free-acid may equally occur. Diffusion to the basal side may slightly decrease due to both the cell layer and the cell culture membrane. This may explain the higher apical release especially in the monolayer model under the no-replenish condition. While small differences might be justified by this mechanism, the significantly higher apical release in high dose latanoprost-eluting etafilcon A requires further investigation. Latanoprost is a highly hydrophobic drug, that could easily release from etafilcon A and dissolve in the apical solution in the ester form as previously has been observed in high water content hydrogels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This might explain the elevated apical release of high dose latanoprost-eluting etafilcon A in the no-replenish model. It should be noted that the EIA kit used in these studies does not distinguish between the two drug forms and thus it will be difficult to verify such a hypothesis. To gain a further understanding of the drug release profile and hydrolysis of the drug in the in vitro cornea model, future studies will involve longer time release study and analytical characterization of latanoprost (ester versus acid form).</p><p id="Par35">While the immortalized human corneal epithelial cells expressed the OATP2A1 transporter gene, our inhibition results with Diclofenac suggested that these transporters were only partially responsible for the transport to the basal side of the latanoprost released from the contact lens materials. The role of other active transport mechanisms and metabolizing enzymes in latanoprost permeation in our in vitro model was further highlighted by fixing the cells prior to the release experiments. Our results on the contribution of different mechanisms of latanoprost transport across cells are in accordance with other in vitro drug permeability studies using primary corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and further suggest the validity of our curved cornea models with immortalized corneal epithelial cells.</p><p id="Par36">Our experimental model allowed the comparisons of apical and basal side latanoprost release profiles between different conditions, monolayer versus multilayer and replenishment versus no-replenishment. It is interesting to note that except for the etalfilcon A-loaded contact lens material, no significant differences in the levels of latanoprost delivered to the basal side was noted between experimental conditions. The absence of significant differences in delivery to the basal side between a monolayer and multilayer corneal model corroborates our prior results using non-curved corneal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the tear replenishment system highlighted differences in latanoprost found in the apical side, no significant changes were observed between replenishment and no-replenishment for the amount of latanoprost that was delivered to the basal side of our corneal models. Combined together, our results would thus suggest that in vitro models to assess drug delivery from biomaterials may be simplified to using a monolayer of corneal epithelial cells while still gaining relevant insights on drug delivery and transport. The impact of tear replenishment in in vitro testing may be more relevant in biocompatibility and cytotoxicity studies where accumulation of a compound may change corneal epithelial cell response. It is important to note that while tear replenishment and a curved multilayer cornea model provide a more physiological testing platform, such a model is also more resource intensive. Future work will aim to validate the model and determine how our in vitro results correlate with in vivo experiments.</p><p id="Par37">While the experimental model took into consideration the replenishment environment of the ocular surface and cells, a limitation of the current in vitro model, which may also explain the limited differences between replenishment versus no- replenishment, is that it does not reproduce the mechanical stimulation that is created from the movement of the eyelid through blinking. In an in vitro model of the ocular surface, this mechanical stimulation would be important as it would allow some movement of the lens and thus promotes tear exchange in the post-lens tear film, which can also affect drug delivery kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Through modeling the microfluidics of tear replenishment in vitro, the tear replenishment system offers an ocular drug delivery testing platform with a reliable and continuous replenishment of the surface of the cell culture model that can contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between corneal epithelial cells and drug delivery systems in vitro. The latanoprost release studies further confirmed the significant role that cells play in the release of an ocular prodrug from a contact lens material. The results presented in this study also demonstrated yet another important role that a dynamic model will have in predicting the amount of drug that can be lost from a contact lens into the tear film/lacrimal system.</p><p id="Par39">While our in vitro model focused on tear replenishment and provided valuable insights on drug release from commercially available lenses, our model does not yet fully represent the dynamic physiological environment of the contact lens-cornea interface as a blinking mechanism, which may affect fluid exchange underneath the contact lens, was not included. Interestingly, our results also highlighted that the in vitro curved monolayer model with no tear replenishment, a simpler cell model, could also provide relevant information on drug released from a biomaterial and transport.</p><p id="Par40">Future work will aim to correlate our in vitro release results to in vivo data. Additionally further investigation is warranted as our in vitro curved cornea model with tear replenishment, which offers a more physiologically relevant ocular surface model where accumulation of released/leached compound is reduced, may provide added value to in vitro biocompatibility studies of novel drugs and ophthalmic materials, allowing to better characterize their impact on cell phenotype in vitro.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author&#8217;s contributions</title><p>Saman Mohammadi: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Data analysis and Interpretation, Visualization, and Drafting of the original manuscript.
