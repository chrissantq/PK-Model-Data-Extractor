Body fat distribution is an important determinant of cardiometabolic derangements (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Abdominal (ABD) obesity (upper body fat accumulation) is associated with an increased risk for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality, while gluteofemoral (lower body) fat storage is associated with a more beneficial cardiometabolic risk profile for a given body mass index (BMI) in both men and women (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>ABD obesity is characterized by subcutaneous AT (SAT) and visceral AT accumulation, which are both related to cardiometabolic risk factors, dependent on factors such as sex and ethnicity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, next to differences in body fat distribution, AT dysfunction is tightly linked to obesity-related complications (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). AT dysfunction is characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, impaired lipid metabolism, decreased adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF), mitochondrial dysfunction, altered oxygenation, a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and impaired adipokine expression/secretion (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Together, these impairments contribute to lipid spillover in the circulation, ectopic fat deposition, and low-grade systemic inflammation, collectively aggravating cardiometabolic disease development (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The predominant sequestration of lipids in lower body AT depots in premenopausal women seems to confer protection against the development of cardiometabolic diseases (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition to AT depot-differences in lipid metabolism, differences in the inflammatory signatures between upper and lower body AT may contribute to the disease risk associated with a certain body fat distribution pattern (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Studies that have compared the inflammatory phenotype of upper and lower body SAT are scarce. Although no major differences in gene expression of inflammatory markers were previously found between ABD and gluteal SAT (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), recent findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> IL-6 release from gluteofemoral SAT may be lower than from ABD SAT in healthy men with normal body weight (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The latter findings might indicate that lower body SAT is characterized by a more beneficial inflammatory phenotype. Importantly, it remains to be established whether differences in the SAT depot-specific expression and secretion of (anti-)inflammatory factors exist in women as well as between people with normal weight and obesity.</p><p>Therefore, the present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether the expression and secretion of several well-known (anti-)inflammatory adipokines differ between upper and lower body SAT in postmenopausal women with normal weight or obesity. We hypothesized that the expression and secretion of proinflammatory factors are higher in upper body as compared to lower body SAT and adipocytes. To test our hypothesis, we compared the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> release of several adipokines across ABD and femoral (FEM) SAT, and investigated SAT depot-specific adipocyte morphology and adipokine expression in well-phenotyped postmenopausal women with normal weight or obesity. Furthermore, the expression and secretion of adipokines was examined <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> using differentiated human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells derived from ABD and FEM SAT from the same individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>A total of 23 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 50&#8211;65 years) with normal weight (BMI 18&#8211;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obesity (BMI 30&#8211;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited.

The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments and sample analyses were performed at Maastricht University Medical Center<sup>+</sup> (Maastricht, the Netherlands).</p><p>Exclusion criteria were smoking, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, liver or kidney malfunction, any chronic medical condition requiring the use of medication known to affect body weight, glucose and/or lipid metabolism, use of anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids) within 14 days prior to study start, planned blood donation 2 months prior to or after study completion, and marked alcohol consumption (&gt;14 alcoholic units/week). Premenopausal or perimenopausal women, defined as either regular periods or a period within the last 12 months from screening date, were also excluded.

Each of these study visits took place within 1 week of the previous visit, separated by at least 2 days. Briefly, during the first visit, participants were screened, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. During the second visit, arterio-venous concentration differences across ABD and FEM SAT were assessed and blood flow in these fat depots was determined. During the third visit, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed to determine body fat percentage and body composition, and ABD and FEM SAT biopsies were collected. These measurements are explained in more detail in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>

Finally, an arterial catheter was inserted into the radial artery. Blood samples were taken simultaneously from the three sites (arterial, ABD, and FEM) at two different time-points 60&#160;min after the cannulation procedures (allowing participants to relax), separated by 30&#160;min, under fasting conditions.</p><p>For the ABD SAT depot, veins located above the inguinal ligament, as determined by using the anterior superior iliac spine and the projected pubic symphysis as reference points, were identified. The SAT areas lateral of the umbilicus and between the lower end of the rib cage and the inguinal ligament were scanned with ultrasound (Philips CX50 Ultrasound, Bothell, USA) on each side to identify suitable veins for cannulation and ATBF measurements in the ABD SAT depot. After application of local anesthetic (lidocaine hydrochloride 1%), a 20-gauge central venous catheter was inserted with the Seldinger technique. Veins in FEM SAT that were suitable for cannulation and ATBF measurements were identified by scanning the inner aspect of the thigh, approximately halfway between the groin and the knee.

Due to the technical difficulties to cannulate the small veins in these SAT depots and to collect blood samples, we successfully completed the measurements and sample collection for nine women with normal weight and six women with obesity. Due to the limited number of paired blood samples draining ABD and FEM SAT for the individuals with normal weight and obesity, we decided to pool the data for all study participants per SAT depot to achieve sufficient statistical power to detect SAT depot-differences in adipokine release.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2_4"><label>2.2.4</label><title>Adipose tissue blood flow</title><p>Fasting ATBF was measured in ABD and FEM SAT using a Doppler ultrasound technique, as previously described (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).

The present findings demonstrate for the first time that upper and lower body adipose tissue as well as adipocytes are characterized by distinct inflammatory signatures in postmenopausal women with normal weight and obesity.</p><p>In the present study, we assessed leptin and adiponectin as classical adipokines altered in obesity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and determined the expression and secretion of several well-known proinflammatory molecules (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, PAI-1, DPP-4, and MCP-1) that have been linked to obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We found significant fractional release of leptin and MCP-1 from ABD and FEM subcutaneous SAT, with similar fractional release of leptin from both SAT depots and higher release of MCP-1 from ABD compared to FEM SAT. The comparable release of leptin from FEM and ABD SAT is in line with a previous report (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). No release of other adipokines, including PAI-1, DPP-4, and adiponectin, across ABD and FEM SAT was detectable. The latter is in line with previous studies, showing no significant release of adiponectin, IL-6, and DPP-4 across human ABD SAT in people with normal weight and obesity (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). One study that did report <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> DPP-4 release across human ABD SAT only found significant release in few individuals with low (&lt;288 ng/ml) plasma DPP-4 concentrations (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), while mean DPP-4 concentrations were much higher (&gt;400 ng/ml) in the present study. The lack of detectable adiponectin release across SAT may be explained by a low release rate and long half-life, reflected by relatively constant circulating concentrations of these adipokines (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). We found higher arterial concentrations of leptin and PAI-1 in women with obesity. Since no differences in the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> fractional release of these factors from ABD and FEM SAT were found between individuals with normal weight and obesity, the higher-circulating leptin and PAI-1 concentrations are likely explained by the higher total fat mass in obesity.</p><p>Differences in the functional properties between AT depots may underlie the cardiometabolic disease risk associated with a certain body fat distribution pattern. Indeed, functional differences between ABD and FEM SAT seem to emerge from adipocytes having distinct properties (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Many studies have demonstrated a close relationship between adipocyte morphology and AT function, with hypertrophic adipocytes (as often seen in people with obesity) showing impairments in lipid metabolism and a more proinflammatory phenotype, which may aggravate insulin resistance (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In the present study, women with obesity had larger adipocytes than individuals with normal weight, both in ABD and FEM SAT. However, adipocyte size did not differ between ABD and FEM SAT in both groups. This is in agreement with some (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) but not all previous reports comparing upper and lower body SAT (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and may relate to characteristics of the study populations investigated (i.e., age and metabolic status). Our study participants did not have severe obesity and had, by definition for inclusion in the study, a relatively healthy metabolic profile. In line with adipocyte hypertrophy in women with obesity, we found higher SAT gene expression of leptin, PAI-1, and IL-6 (only in ABD SAT) in the people with obesity. Few studies, however, have directly compared upper and lower body SAT inflammation. Intriguingly, despite similar fat cell sizes in both SAT depots, the present findings demonstrate lower gene expression of leptin, MCP-1, PAI-1, and TNF-&#945; in ABD than FEM SAT. Previous reports indicated that lower body SAT shows a similar (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or more proinflammatory profile compared to ABD SAT (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Moreover, global transcriptional profiling of men and women failed to identify differentially expressed clusters of inflammation-specific genes between ABD and gluteal SAT, although stronger associations between the expression of proinflammatory factors and several obesity-related traits were found for ABD SAT (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Since whole-AT gene expression profiles are determined by gene expression in multiple adipose-derived cell types such as adipocytes and immune cells, we also specifically investigated gene expression profiles in differentiated human primary ABD and FEM subcutaneous adipocytes derived from the participants that underwent the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> measurements and SAT biopsies. Interestingly, we observed that hMADS cells derived from ABD and FEM SAT that have been differentiated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (and therefore been exposed to the same experimental microenvironment) show different gene expression patterns. Indeed, we demonstrate higher gene expression of the proinflammatory factors IL-6 and PAI-1 in ABD compared to FEM adipocytes derived from women with both normal weight and obesity. Furthermore, the expression of leptin was higher and that of adiponectin lower in ABD compared to FEM adipocytes derived from women with normal weight. These findings highlight intrinsic differences in the inflammatory signatures of human ABD and FEM adipocytes, which are already present in cells derived from a healthy (&#8216;non-obese&#8217;) AT microenvironment (i.e., normal-weight individuals). In addition, DPP-4 gene expression was lower in ABD than FEM adipocytes derived from women with obesity. Adipocyte differentiation markers were not significantly different between ABD and FEM adipocytes, suggesting that these differences in adipocyte gene expression are not due to differences in adipocyte differentiation between ABD and FEM adipocytes. The fact that inflammatory gene expression was not higher in differentiated human primary ABD and FEM adipocytes derived from women with obesity compared to normal weight provides further support for the notion that adipocyte hypertrophy and/or the contribution of the inflammatory cell component are key factors determining the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> AT inflammatory signature. The differences in adipocyte gene expression did, however, not translate into functional differences in the secretion of adipokines. Specifically, we only found a lower secretion of MCP-1 from ABD compared to FEM adipocytes derived from both women with normal weight or obesity, but no differences in the secretion rates of leptin, PAI-1, IL-6, and DPP-4 between ABD and FEM adipocytes were apparent. The discrepancy between MCP-1 fractional release <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> being higher from ABD versus FEM SAT, while ABD SAT MCP-1 gene expression as well as ABD adipocyte MCP-1 secretion were lower compared to FEM SAT/adipocytes might be explained by depot-differences in post-transcriptional regulation and secretory pathways influencing the release of adipokines from these fat depots. Notably, gene expression of IL-6 was higher in ABD than FEM adipocytes, while no significant differences in IL-6 gene expression were found between ABD and FEM AT. This might be explained by depot-differences in IL-6 expression due to the presence of other cells than adipocytes such as immune cells (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which warrants further investigation.</p><p>A strength of the present study is that we, for the first time, combined paired <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> measurements across ABD and FEM SAT, analyses in ABD and FEM SAT biopsies, and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments using differentiated human primary ABD and FEM subcutaneous adipocytes derived from the study participants. Furthermore, we did not perform the experiments using a pool of stem cells from normal-weight and obese donors (risking those outcomes are influenced/masked by strong effects seen in a specific donor) or a single donor, as often done, but performed the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments with cells from many donors with normal weight and obesity separately.</p><p>Noteworthy, the present study also has some limitations. First, a formal power calculation was not performed, given the exploratory nature of the study. The number of participants we aimed to include in our study to detect differences was based on previous studies using the arterio-venous balance technique to investigate group differences in adipokines/metabolites across upper-body versus lower-body AT (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Third, due to the technical difficulties to cannulate and collect blood samples from the small veins in ABD and FEM, we were able to successfully complete sample collection for nine women with normal weight and six women with obesity. Due to the limited number of paired blood samples draining ABD and FEM SAT for the individuals with normal weight and obesity, we could unfortunately not analyze data separately for both groups due to limited statistical power. Secondly, we determined ATBF using Doppler ultrasound, which provides data on intravascular blood flow in relatively large SAT veins rather than at the capillary level (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Unfortunately, it was not possible to utilize the <sup>133</sup>Xe wash-out technique due to the global production stop of medical <sup>133</sup>Xe (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Consequently, we could not quantify absolute fluxes of adipokines per unit AT, and data on <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> release of adipokines should therefore be interpreted with some caution. Nevertheless, calculation of fractional release of adipokines also yields valuable insights into adipokine release across different AT depots, especially since ATBF was not significantly different between ABD and FEM SAT in the present study. Finally, we only studied the superficial layer of SAT. Previous studies have shown different functional properties when comparing adipocytes derived from the superficial and deep subcutaneous layers (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that upper and lower body SAT are characterized by distinct inflammatory signatures in postmenopausal women with normal weight and obesity, which seem independent of adipocyte size. Future studies with a larger sample size are warranted to investigate functional differences of upper and lower body SAT in different populations, taking age, sex, metabolic status, body composition, obesity duration and weight cycling, as well as differential immune cell populations into account, and relate these to metabolic health at the whole-body level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original data of the present study are included in the article/<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">
