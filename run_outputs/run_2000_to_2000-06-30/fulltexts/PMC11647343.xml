The recruitment process has not yet commenced and is anticipated to commence in March 2024, concluding in September 2024. Enrolled patients will be evenly distributed into five groups, namely morphine groups (M1&#8211;M4) and the control group (M0). The primary outcome measure is the incidence rate of postoperative use Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score &#8805;4 points within 24 hours, which will be primarily assessed through bedside follow-up conducted by investigators and patient self-assessment at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes encompass the following: incidence of postoperative NRS score &#8805;4 within 48 hours, occurrence of SpO2 &lt;90% (during air inhalation)/ SpO2 &lt;95% (during nasal cannula oxygen inhalation) and respiratory rate (RR)&#65308;10 breaths/min recorded on the bedside monitoring, Ramsay sedation score, administration of rescue analgesics and total usage of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump, time to first flatus and food intake, maternal and neonatal urinary morphine concentrations, and any other maternal adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and neonatal depression.

Therefore, optimising analgesia strategies after caesarean section plays a pivotal role in promoting rapid recovery and providing comfortable medical care.</p><p>Neuraxial morphine is considered the gold standard for postpartum analgesia, offering effective and prolonged pain relief for a duration of 14&#8211;36 hours,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1 2</sup></xref> which should be carefully conducted in accordance with the recommendations provided by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American Society of Regional Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (ASRA). The guidelines recommend close monitoring of ventilation, oxygenation and level of consciousness in patients who received a single dose of morphine, which should be conducted continuously for a minimum duration of 20 min postadministration, followed by hourly assessments until 2 hours after dosing. The frequency of monitoring can be adjusted based on the patient&#8217;s overall clinical condition and concurrent medication usage. The patients who receive other forms of analgesia, such as intravenous or epidural pumps, should be monitored on an hourly basis during the first 12 hours, every 2 hours from 12 to 24 hours, and at least every 4 hours thereafter. Special attention must be given to patients with an increased risk of respiratory depression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, considering the minimal risk of respiratory depression associated with contemporary strategies for administering neuraxial morphine, studies have demonstrated the safety of clinically relevant doses of neuraxial morphine following caesarean section. The highest and lowest rates of clinically significant respiratory depression were found to be 1.63/10 000 (95% CI 0.62 to 8.77) and 1.08/10 000 (95% CI 0.24 to 7.22), respectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) also suggests that the frequency and intensity of such monitoring may be excessive for healthy women without specific comorbidities. SOAP recommends using an ultra-low dose of morphine (intrathecal &#8804;50 ug, epidural &#8804;1 mg) for neuraxial analgesia, which does not require additional respiratory monitoring in the absence of other risk factors affecting respiration. For low-dose morphine (intrathecal: 50&#8211;150 &#956;g, epidural: 1&#8211;3 mg), respiratory and sedation assessments should be conducted every 2 hours during a postoperative period lasting 12 hours. High doses of morphine (intrathecal &gt;150 &#956;g, epidural &gt;3 mg) should be monitored according to ASA/ASRA standards.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In cases where low-dose morphine is administrated to low-risk women, excessive vigilance in monitoring for respiratory depression may impact the allocation of medical resource and increase nursing workload. However, for high-risk patients with comorbidities or risk factors that predispose them to respiratory depression, it is essential to proactively identify and adjust the monitoring approach beforehand. Additionally, the monitoring of respiratory function may also disrupt sleep patterns of mothers, interfere with lactation processes, impede the provision of neonatal care, and thus compromise the quality of patient-centred care following a caesarean section without providing ant additional safety benefits.</p><p>The ASA/ASRA guidelines inadvertently reduce the utilisation of neuraxial morphine, despite research and long-term clinical use demonstrating the safety of low doses of intrathecal or epidural morphine for postpartum pain management. Over the past few decades, millions of women in the USA who underwent caesarean section have safely received neuraxial morphine, which offers superior analgesic effect compared with systemic opioid administration and should be prioritised for postpartum pain relief. The combination of low-dose neuraxial morphine administration with various analgesics (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen) effectively mitigates postoperative pain following caesarean section, while concurrently reducing the incidence of side effects such as pruritus, nausea and vomiting, and potential respiratory depression by 30%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Alternatively, in the absence of these drugs, regional nerve block such as transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) may be considered.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, recent studies suggest that while TAPB and QLB provide effective postoperative pain relief compared with control groups, their additional benefits when combined with neuraxial morphine administration are limited.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The guidelines issued by the European Regional Association of Anesthesia and Analgesia and the European Association of Obstetric Anesthesia recommend the administration of intrathecal morphine (50&#8211;100 &#956;g) or diacetylmorphine (300 &#956;g) during caesarean section or morphine (2&#8211;3 mg) or diacetylmorphine (2&#8211;3 mg) through an epidural catheter as an alternative.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Both options yield similar analgesic effects and side effects.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Furthermore, it is important to note that there is a ceiling effect associated with neuraxial administration of morphine, which means higher doses (intrathecal &gt;150 &#956;g; epidural &gt;4 mg) may not provide better analgesia but can increase the incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 10</sup></xref></p><p>In light of the prevailing practice in our institution, where a majority of caesarean sections are performed under combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, followed by postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) along with regional nerve block (such as TAPB), this research aims to enhance the multimodal postpartum analgesia programme and investigate the optimal dosage of epidural morphine for healthy women. The objective is to alleviate moderate and severe postoperative pain after caesarean section while minimising opioid usage and associated complications. Additionally, it seeks to reduce unnecessary respiratory monitoring resources, save medical costs, promote patient-centred enhanced recovery after caesarean (ERAC) and improve maternal and infant outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and patient enrolment</title><p>This study is planned to enrol parturients who are scheduled for elective caesarean section under combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia at our institution between March 2024 and September 2024.

Based on the preliminary experiment conducted in our institution, it was observed that the prevalence of moderate to severe pain (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores &#8805;4) within 24 hours after caesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia with conventional analgesia was found to be 38.9%. We assume that the occurrence of moderate and severe pain within 24 hours after epidural administration of different doses of morphine (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg), respectively, decreases to 35%, 30%, 25% and 25% with one-sided &#945; level of significance set at 2.5% and a power of analysis set at 90%.

Mean values of NRS at each time point are reported for each group. A linear regression model is used with time as the independent variable and the parturient&#8217;s corresponding NRS scores as dependent variables to compare differences and determine the corresponding CIs among all groups. The measurement data are expressed as mean&#177;SD, while the normality is assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Intraoperative interventions: On the parturient&#8217;s arrival in the operating room, standard ECG and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and establishment of venous access should be performed. The parturient should be positioned in left lateral decubitus for combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia at either L3&#8211;L4 or L2&#8211;L3 intervertebral space. Following strict adherence to aseptic principles, a 16-gauge Tuohy needle is used to puncture the ligamentum flavum, followed by insertion of a 25-gauge needle through the dura mater. After confirming unobstructed cerebrospinal fluid outflow, 0.5% bupivacaine (2.5&#8211;2.7 mL) is then administered into the subarachnoid space, followed by placement of an epidural catheter approximately 3&#8211;4 cm cephalad from the initial puncture site. Subsequently, the parturient&#8217;s position should be changed to supine with a leftward tilt of the operating bed while blood pressure monitoring occurs at 1 min intervals. The administration of phenylephrine at a rate of 0.5 &#956;g/kg/min is employed concurrently to maintain blood pressure fluctuations within&#177;20% prior to surgery, with adjustments being made accordingly based on specific circumstances. The morphine injection (1 mL:10 mg) is diluted with 0.5% glucose and sodium chloride infusion solution to achieve a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and subsequently administered through the epidural catheter 5 min prior to the end of the surgical procedure. Following the injection, an additional 2&#8211;4 mL of 0.5% glucose and sodium chloride infusion solution is delivered via the epidural catheter to ensure a total volume of 5 mL. The control group is administrated an epidural injection of 5 mL of a solution containing 0.5% glucose and sodium chloride infusion solution. (The sensory block level is evaluated before and after administration, with discontinuation of any medication or saline infusion if the sensory block level surpasses T4.) The intravenous analgesia pump uses a mixture of butorphanol tartrate (12 mg) and 150 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, with a background dose set at 2 mL, single doses at 2 mL and a lockout time of 30 min. It is connected to the parturient&#8217;s vein channel and initiated at the start of suturing the skin. Intravenous administration of dexamethasone (5 mg) and metoclopramide (10 mg) is routinely used for proactive management of postpartum nausea and vomiting in all patients.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study outline.

They are transferred to the ward approximately 20 min later, without any exceptional circumstances. During the initial 24-hour postoperative period, all parturients should undergo ECG monitoring and receive inhaled oxygen at a rate of 2 L/min through a nasal catheter while maintaining urinary catheters. Subsequently, blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels are monitored every 6 hours, along with pneumatic therapy implemented for venous thrombosis prevention.

If the NRS scores fall between 4 and 6, parturients are instructed to either press the automatic administration button on the PCIA pump as preoperative education or request an intramuscular injection of pethidine (50&#8211;100 mg) and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (25 mg) from ward nurses. In cases where NRS score exceeded 6, direct intramuscular injections of pethidine (50&#8211;100 mg) and chlorpromazine hydrochloride injection (25 mg) may be administered in addition to activating the PCIA pump for pain relief. The goal for effective pain management is to achieve NRS score &#8804;3.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Description of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Degree</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NRS pain score</td><td valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No pain</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No pain</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top" colspan="1">Mild pain</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No pain when lying quietly, and pain when turning over and coughing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain when coughing, and no pain when deep breathing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No pain when lying quietly, pain when coughing and deep breathing</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top" colspan="1">Moderate pain</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intermittent pain when lying quietly</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Persistent pain when lying quietly</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acute pain when lying quietly</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top" colspan="1">Severe pain</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe pain that can not sleep</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Persistent severe pain and the whole body sweated</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excruciating and intolerable pain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Worst pain exceeds that of death</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The sedation level of the parturients is assessed using Ramsay sedation scoring system (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), with satisfactory sedation falling within scores 2&#8211;4, while excessive sedation is indicated by scores 5 and 6.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> If the SpO<sub>2</sub> level drops below 90% during air inhalation or below 95% while receiving oxygen through nasal cannula, accompanied by RR less than 10 breaths per minute as indicated on monitoring equipment, it is imperative for the patient&#8217;s family members or caregivers to promptly notify the attending physician by activating the alarm bell.

Adequate postoperative analgesia is crucial for mitigating perioperative stress response and minimising acute and chronic complications associated with pain.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Therefore, optimising the analgesia strategy following caesarean section plays a pivotal role in promoting rapid recovery and providing comfortable medical care.</p><p>The opioid analgesic morphine is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain. It exerts its effects primarily by agonising &#956;-opioid receptors, resulting in analgesia and sedation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The metabolism of oral or intramuscular injected morphine results in the formation of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> which are primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with a minor portion being excreted into breast milk. Epidural administration of morphine specifically targets opioid receptors located in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, thereby exerting its effects along spinal nerves. Meanwhile, a portion of the drug is absorbed into circulation and acts on opioid receptors within the central nervous system. Previous study suggests that urine concentrations of morphine and its metabolites are highly correlated to those of serum.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Considering the feasibility of specimen acquisition, we collect maternal urine samples at 3 hours and 6 hours post partum, as well as infant samples at 3 hours after neonatal sucking. (Breast feeding is initiated within 2 hours after delivery.) All samples are put in tubes without additives and stored at a temperature of &#8722;70&#8451; before being analysed at the Department of Medical Laboratory, West China Second University Hospital. The urine samples yield a positive result once the concentration reached 300 ng/mL.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on multimodal analgesia in research, aiming to optimise perioperative pain management, prevent central sensitisation and mitigate the adverse effects of opioid misuse. Since 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines from the UK have advocated for the implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols in obstetric units.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The ERAS society has issued three distinct guidelines specifically addressing the postoperative needs of women undergoing caesarean sections, encompassing prenatal care, intraoperative care, postnatal care and perinatal care.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The ERAC protocol recommends the utilisation of neuraxial morphine, which is the most commonly applied analgesic method, in combination with intravenous non-opioid analgesics in the operation room or oral acetaminophen before or after delivery. In institutions where neuraxial morphine is unavailable, TAPB or QLB can be used.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The administration of neuraxial morphine for analgesia necessitates comprehensive monitoring of parturients&#8217; respiratory system, oxygenation and level of consciousness due to its potential effects. This requires a significant allocation of medical resources including monitoring equipment and personnel, which limits the application of neuraxial morphine for postpartum analgesia. Despite suboptimal management of postpartum pain, as evidenced by a preliminary investigation conducted at our institution that typically involves a combination of TAPB and PCIA. We propose that an optimal dosage of neuraxial morphine, the primary focus of this trial, in conjunction with multimodal analgesia such as a PCIA pump and TAPB for pain management, could not only mitigate the adverse effects associated with opioid utilisation and alleviate monitoring burdens but also yield superior analgesic efficacy.</p><p>This trial has been meticulously designed; however, certain limitations still persist. First, the concentration gradient of morphine in insufficient groups is inadequate. A dose of 1 mL:10 mg morphine diluted to 1 mg/mL aligns with clinical practice and there is no evidence that a lower dosage range can produce clinically differences. To ensure valid administration, we perform a flush of the tube with 2&#8211;4 mL 0.5% glucose and sodium chloride injection for the experimental group and 5 mL for the control group. Second, a thorough investigation into the optimal analgesic dose of morphine may be lacking. Although the maximum single dose of epidural morphine for analgesia is 5 mg,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> there seems to be a ceiling effect observed with epidural morphine administration, where doses exceeding 4 mg do not necessarily result in improved analgesic effects but rather increase the likelihood of side effects such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 10</sup></xref> Therefore, for this trial, we set the maximum dosage at 4 mg. Additionally, in order to enhance clinical practicability, we refrain from imposing restrictions on the dosage of neuraxial local anaesthetics, incision length, operation duration or the qualifications of surgeons and anaesthesiologists. It is important to acknowledge that there may be additional confounding factors that could potentially impact the accuracy of our results. The aforementioned indicators can be incorporated into subsequent analyses to evaluate correlations and control for confounding bias. Most importantly, the primary outcome is a subjective rating scale, which may be influenced by cognitive bias and patients&#8217; preconceived notion of pain, potentially leading to inaccurate assessment of the analgesic effect and introducing subjective bias. To address this concern, prior to trial initiation, researchers should undergo systematic training on relevant scales, implement SOPs and receive education on trial-related content including NRS scoring criteria and the use of PCIA pump for enrolled parturients. Additionally, objective indicators such as the incidence of rescue analgesia and PCIA pump usage are also evaluated in order to comprehensively assess the analgesic effect.</p><p>The trial is expected to contribute to the improvement of safety, efficacy and widespread utilisation of epidural morphine in clinical practice, ultimately facilitating ERAC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>prepub:</bold> Prepublication history for this paper is available online.
