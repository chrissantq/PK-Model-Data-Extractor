The persistence of PAHs in the environment poses a potential threat to human health through bioaccumulation and biomagnifications via food chains <xref rid="pone.0084296-Augusto1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Arising from both natural and anthropogenic sources, PAHs are ubiquitous in different natural phases such as plant, soil, sediment, water and air <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus it is of great importance to investigate the transport and transformation of PAHs in the environment. Many PAHs, especially with four or more rings, are generally recalcitrant to be biodegraded in the environment because of their low water-solubility <xref rid="pone.0084296-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These compounds are more likely to be affected by sedimentation and photooxidation <xref rid="pone.0084296-Pagni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, studies on the photolysis processes of PAHs are extremely important in order to evaluate the fate and transformation of these hazardous compounds in the environment, and have being attracted great attention <xref rid="pone.0084296-Tham1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. At present, most studies are focus on the photolysis of PAHs in liquid medium (e.g., water, ethyl alcohol and acetone) or adsorbed on solid particles (e.g., fly ash, carbon black silica gel, porous glass, clay sand and active aluminum) <xref rid="pone.0084296-Korfmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0084296-Reza1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is well known that vegetation plays a key role in the environmental fate of PAHs <xref rid="pone.0084296-Gorshkov1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Only a few studies involve the photolytic behaviors of PAHs adsorbed on vegetation <xref rid="pone.0084296-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Mangroves are various kinds of trees growing along the coastlines of tropical and sub-tropical regions. Because of their special ecological functions, mangroves are considered to be reservoir of lipophilic contaminations, including PAHs from various sources <xref rid="pone.0084296-OyoIta1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Mangrove leaves are common covered with large surface areas and thick waxy layers, which can accumulate the lipophilic PAHs in atmosphere <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Ke et al have investigated the fate of PAHs contamination in a mangrove swamp after an oil spill accident. They have believed that photolysis is one of the important way to remove the PAHs adsorbed on the mangrove leaves <xref rid="pone.0084296-Ke1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus it is of great significance to study the photochemical behaviors of PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaves. However, recent studies on the photolysis of PAHs adsorbed on plant leaves are mostly entirely destructive sample extraction, which can not realize <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> monitoring the photolysis of PAHs on the leaves. In addition, the amount of PAHs volatilization from the leaf surfaces into the atmosphere and entering into the inner leaf tissues could not be ignored during the long duration experiment <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To overcome the limitations of the traditional extraction procedures, Wild and his co-workers have used the two-photon microscopy to track directly some PAHs adsorbed on the plant leaves <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wild1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wild2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In our previous studies, the two-photon microscopy has also been utilized for visualization three typical PAHs into the inner tissues of two mangrove species <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However it is very expensive to purchase and maintain that instrument, which could be difficult to be widely used. Optical fiber with high light focalization, low weight and small size could be used for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> investigation of pollutants adsorbed on solid substrates <xref rid="pone.0084296-Niessner1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In our previous studies, a fiber-optic fluorimetry has been used for direct investigation the photolysis of some PAHs adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of three mangrove species <xref rid="pone.0084296-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, the photolysis behaviors of PAHs adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces have not been fully explored. Questions without answers are still forthcoming. What are the main transformation pathways of the PAHs adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces? Is photolysis significant for the fate of PAHs in the environment? Are the photolysis mechanisms of different kinds of PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaves similar? What are the photolytic products of the PAHs? How to get the photolytic products from the mangrove leaf surfaces? These questions are of great importance for us to learn more about the environmental behaviors of the adsorbed PAHs on mangrove leaves. Moreover, a synchronous solid surface fluorimetry (S-SSF) combined with an optical fiber and a fluorescence spectrophotometer has also been established for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> determination of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaves in our previous work <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The S-SSF method has many obvious advantages: it was easy, rapid and inexpensive to purchase, maintain and operate. Additionally, the original existing forms and the distribution of the PAHs adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces could be easily determined in situ, which would be impossible for traditional methods, such as GC-MS, GC, and HPLC, which need an extraction of sample before analysis. Furthermore, no complex pretreatment involving a large amount of organic solvent is needed, and it takes less than 1 minute for the determination of one sample. To further demonstrate the tremendous scope of this method, the S-SSF was also applied for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> investigation the photolysis of typical PAHs adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces under the laboratory experimental conditions. In this work, anthracene (An) and pyrene (Py) were selected as the model PAHs, the viviparous seedlings of <italic toggle="yes">Ko</italic> in salt-resistance and the non-viviparous seedlings of <italic toggle="yes">Ac</italic> in salt-tolerance were studied as the typical mangrove species.

This mangrove forest is wild and does not belong to any individuals or organizations, thus no specific permissions were required for these activities. In the experiment, only a few mangrove seedlings were collected, which neither involved endangered or protected species nor vertebrate studies. The seedlings of the two mangrove species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g001">Figure 1</xref>) with similar length and fresh weight were then planted on sand in pots partially submerged in nutrient Hoagland solution <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

By adjusting the height of the fiber optical probe of mercury lamp, the diameter size formed by the mercury lamp was fixed as the same as the length of the leaf blade during the course of the experiment. And the center of the light spot was directly faced the center of the leaf vein. Thus, the light intensity accepted by each sample location of the leaves is basically the same. In addition, the proper illumination intensity on the leaf surfaces was controlled at 3.53(&#177;0.07)&#215;10<sup>4</sup> lx, which was determined by a ZDS-10 illuminometer (Shanghai, China) in the photolysis experiments.

The water as the homogeneous media is very simple. Thus, the mechanisms of the photolysis of PAHs in water are relatively simple and much work has been done in relevant researches. The photolytic behaviors of the PAHs adsorbed on the leaf surfaces have been found very common in the nature. And the leaf as the heterogeneous substrate is very complicated. Thus, few studies involve the photolysis processes of PAHs adsorbed on leaf surfaces. In addition, the photolysis mechanisms of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaves have been hardly studied. Therefore, in order to further study the photolysis mechanisms of the PAH adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces, the photolysis of the same initial amount of PAH dissolved in water was also investigated.

Because the mangrove leaf is the complicated and heterogeneous media, the peak area spectrophotometry was not used for determination of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces. The wavelength of 387 nm and 343 nm was selected as the fluorescence spectra for the quantification of An and Py, respectively. It is reported that photolytic products of the PAH might be the main interference for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> study of the fluorescence signals during photolysis <xref rid="pone.0084296-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, the S-SSF spectra of An and Py adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of two mangrove species should be investigated over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g002">Figure 2</xref> showed the S-SSF spectra of An and Py adsorbed on the <italic toggle="yes">Ko</italic> leaf surfaces taken at different time during the irradiations. And the decrease of the relative S-SSF intensities was observed with time. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the shape of the spectrum and width of the half-wide spectral band were no considerable differences over time. Thus, the photolytic products could not interfere with the detection of the An and Py adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces. Moreover, the autofluorescence of the uncontaminated mangrove leaves was very weak at the selected spectrum, which could not affect the detection of the fluorescence signals either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g002">Figure 2</xref>). There was also a similar trend of the photolysis of An and Py adsorbed on <italic toggle="yes">Ac</italic> leaf surfaces. Consequently, the S-SSF was acceptable to be utilized as an <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> method for the photolysis study of An and Py adsorbed on two specific mangrove leaf surfaces.

In this experiment, the illumination time was less than four hours. Thus, the decrease of fluorescence signals of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces might be primarily due to the volatilization from the leaf surface into the atmosphere, and the quantities of the PAHs entering into the inner leaf tissues could be neglected in a short-term experiment. In this work, the heating effects of mercury lamp whose light is guided by an optical fiber could be avoided.

As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the curves demonstrated the photolysis processes of each PAH were multi-decays.

It was shown from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084296-t001">Table 1</xref> that the photolysis half-lives of the lower initial amount of An (44.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and Py (50.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) ranged from 14.8 min to 19.2 min and 32.5 min to 43.9 min, respectively. In addition, the photolysis half-lives of the higher initial amount of An (445 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and Py (505 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) ranged from 25.3min to 38.9 min and 76.2 min to 101.9 min, respectively. Consequently, for both An and Py in the same experimental conditions, the higher the quantity of the PAH adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces, the slower the photolysis rate of the PAH.

Therefore, some excited states or polymer molecules of PAH might be formed on the leaf surfaces and absorb the photons of UV light. And the higher the quantity of the PAH adsorbed on the leaf surfaces, the more the excited states or polymer molecules of PAH formed. In conclusion, the number of photons striking the leaf surfaces decreased, and thereby decrease the photolysis rate of the PAH adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces <xref rid="pone.0084296-Fioressi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0084296-Fioressi2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, the equations obtained in this work were not generalized. There are some limiting factors. Because of the multi-layers of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces, the UV photons accepted by the adsorbed PAHs on a different layer should be different, and the photolysis processes of the adsorbed PAHs should also be different. However, only a small amount of PAHs were selected in this work, the number of the layers could be small. Thus, the differences could be acceptable for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> study the photolysis processes of PAHs adsorbed mangrove leaf surfaces in a short time. It was also from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084296-t001">Table 1</xref> that for the same amount of substances, the photolysis rate of Py adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of the same mangrove species was much lower than that of An.

Previous studies found that the wax or lipid on the plant leaves could absorb the UV photons, which might create the light filtering effect.

In addition, the relative S-SSF intensities of the each PAH had little change when the amount of each PAH degraded to about 12% of the initial amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084296-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In other words, the photolysis processes of the residual PAH adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces could not occur with the illumination time prolonging. Xu et al and Schuler et al also found the same phenomena in their studies. However, they did not give the possible reasons <xref rid="pone.0084296-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Schuler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Combined with others and our present studies, a little amount of PAH might enter into the inner leaf tissues and could not absorb the UV photons because of the light filtering effects of mangrove leaf surfaces. On the other hand, the generated photolytic products of the PAH in the upper layers might cover on the residual PAH in the low layers during illumination. Thus, the photolysis rates of the PAHs in the low layers might decrease. As time goes on, the photolysis of the residual PAH in the low layers might not occur <xref rid="pone.0084296-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084296-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Thus, the photolysis rate of PAH appears to be highly dependent on the substrate on which they are adsorbed.

With same amount of substances, the kinetic results of the photolysis of An and Py adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of two mangrove species and in water were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084296-t001">Table 1</xref>.

And the number of UV photons striking to the PAH adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces decreased, and thereby slowed down the photolysis rate of the adsorbed PAH. For this reason, the photolysis mechanism of the same PAH adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces and in water might be different, further studies are therefore needed.</p><fig id="pone-0084296-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0084296.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Photolysis Processes of the same initial amount of the An (44.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and Py (50.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) adsorbed on two typical mangrove leaf surfaces and in water.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0084296.g006.jpg"/></fig><fig id="pone-0084296-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0084296.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Variation of <italic toggle="yes">F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>0</sub></italic> vs time during photolysis of the same initial amount of the An (44.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and Py (50.5 ng.spot<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) adsorbed on two typical mangrove leaf surfaces and in water.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0084296.g007.jpg"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using the established S-SSF method, the photolysis processes of An and Py adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of two mangrove species were <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> studied for the first time. Meanwhile, the photolysis for both An and Py adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of two mangrove species followed first-order reaction kinetics with their photolysis rates in the order of <italic toggle="yes">Ac</italic>&gt;<italic toggle="yes">Ko</italic>. In addition, the higher the quantity of the PAH adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces, the slower the photolysis rate of the PAH. Moreover, for the same amount of substances, the photolysis rate of Py adsorbed on the same mangrove leaf surfaces was much lower than that of the An, and the photolysis rate of the same PAH in water was much faster than on mangrove leaf surfaces. Thus, photochemical behaviors of PAHs were dependent not only on their molecular structures but also the physical-chemical properties of the substrates on which they are adsorbed.</p><p>The S-SSF method is simple, accurate and easy operating for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> investigation the photolysis of the PAHs adsorbed on mangrove leaf surfaces. However, much more studied need to be carried out in the near future. For example, PAHs usually exist in a multi-component in real environment, and this S-SSF might be a good way to be used for determination of multi-component PAHs simultaneously. It could be prospected that with the development of the S-SSF methods, it would be helpful for us to understand more the environmental behavior of PAHs in real environment, and it would also provide us a new way to study on mechanisms of phytoremediation of PAHs in mangrove wetland or other contaminated mediums.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
