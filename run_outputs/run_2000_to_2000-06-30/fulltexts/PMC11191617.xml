The current standard for securing the airway in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy is endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation. Several studies have investigated the use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in this procedure. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy of the LMA versus ETT in adenotonsillectomy.</p></sec><sec id="section2-19160216241263851"><title>Method</title><p>Databases were searched from inception to 2022 for randomized controlled trials and comparative studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The primary outcome is the rate of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs). Secondary outcomes included the rate of conversion to ETT, desaturations, nausea/vomiting, and surgical time. A subgroup analysis, risk of bias, publication bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessments were also performed.</p></sec><sec id="section3-19160216241263851"><title>Results</title><p>Twelve studies were included in the analysis (4176 patients). The mean overall conversion to ETT was 8.36% [95% confidence interval (CI)&#8201;=&#8201;8.17, 8.54], and for the pediatric group 8.27% (95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;8.08, 8.47). The mean rate of conversion to ETT secondary to complications was 2.89% (95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;2.76, 3.03) while the rest was from poor surgical access. Overall, there was no significant difference in PRAEs [odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.60, 2.22], desaturations (OR 0.79, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.38, 1.64), or minor complications (OR 0.89, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.50, 1.55). The use of LMA yielded significantly shorter operative time (mean difference &#8722;4.38&#8201;minutes, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;8.28, &#8722;0.49) and emergence time (mean difference &#8722;4.15&#8201;minutes, 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;5.63, &#8722;2.67).</p></sec><sec id="section4-19160216241263851"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For adenotonsillectomy surgery, LMA is a safe alternative to ETT and requires less operative time.

Complications known as PRAEs were grouped together and included apnea, bronchospasm, desaturations, and laryngospasm. This was chosen as a primary endpoint as it is a cumulative measure that measures airway complications perioperatively. Secondary endpoints included the rate of conversion to ETT as well as all other complications reported such as coughing, gagging, kinking issues, stridor, and obstruction from mouth gag insertion, transient hypoxia, nausea, and vomiting. Since many articles reported on transient hypoxia, nausea, and vomiting, we have chosen to group these variables and analyze them as minor complications. Desaturations were also analyzed separately as many PRAE events can ultimately lead to desaturations when severe. This can therefore provide an alternative measure to respiratory/airway events encountered during the surgery. We also reported on measures of operative time, induction time, and emergence time. We did not include studies that did not include outcomes related to complications associated with the anesthetic technique or the surgery.</p></sec><sec id="section9-19160216241263851"><title>Electronic Searches</title><p>The search was not restricted by date and was searched to November 23, 2022.

There was no statistically significant difference in the number of PRAEs, desaturations, and minor complications between the LMA and ETT in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Similarly, no difference was seen in the pediatric subgroup.</p><p>The use of ETT in adenotonsillectomy is the current standard practice. Our study found, when LMA is used, the conversion rate from LMA to ETT was 8.36% (8.27% of cases for the pediatric subgroup). However, the majority of the conversions were secondary to surgical access and positioning issues and not secondary to complications. The conversion secondary to complications was 2.89% (2.43% for the pediatric population). This suggests that most conversions, when necessary, are performed in a safe and controlled setting. The number of conversions secondary to access may decrease as surgeons and anesthesiologists become more comfortable with using the LMA with this type of procedure. In addition, careful patient selection may also help reduce the rate of conversions. Based on our clinical experience, we believe excluding patients with a known difficult airway, age less than 2, a high body mass index (BMI), and craniofacial abnormalities may help in both reducing complications as well as issues with surgical access.</p><p>The LMA has been shown to be an efficient alternative to ETT in different surgeries. A 1995 meta-analysis shows that the LMA helps improve induction and emergence hemodynamics as well as decrease coughing and sore throat postoperatively.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr26-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> The LMA also helps reduce the narcotic requirement during surgery which is especially beneficial in the pediatric population.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr27-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> In addition, our analysis shows that the LMA may improve operative time likely by improving the ease and efficiency of extubation and emergence. With evidence of decreased cardiopulmonary stimulation and ease of emergence, the LMA could potentially be beneficial for patients with reactive airway disease or comorbidities that predispose patients to PRAEs.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup></p><p>However, there are some limitations to the LMA especially as it relates to adenotonsillectomy. First, the LMA does not protect against aspiration. If excessive bleeding is encountered during the surgery, the risk of aspiration would be greater with an LMA. However, our review did not find aspiration to be a concern in patients treated with LMA. The second concern is issues regarding tube obstruction leading to difficulties with ventilation. It is hypothesized that this could be secondary to a lower depth of anesthesia resulting in reflex laryngeal closure with mouth gag opening,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> mechanical compression of the device, or displacement of the epiglottis.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> One potential solution could be to use a half-size smaller LMA to improve surgical access and decrease rates of obstructions as suggested in the study by Peng et al.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> It is also beneficial to use a mouth gag that includes a groove for the LMA, such as the Boyle-Davis, which often provides more space for the tube before causing an obstruction. In addition, the use of a reinforced flexible LMA may be especially useful in this procedure as it may help decrease rates of mechanical tube obstruction with mouth gag opening.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> In our clinical experience, we have found that a regular reinforced LMA fared better than a flexible LMA. We believe more studies comparing the different types of LMA available would help optimize success in this procedure.</p><p>Overall, the data used in this meta-analysis were extracted from articles with a low or medium risk of bias. Only one article included in the analysis had a high risk of bias. To resolve possible confounders secondary to these data, the analysis as it relates to safety measures was repeated omitting the data from the one article with a high risk of bias. This new analysis still did not show any significant differences between LMA and ETT in terms of PRAEs, desaturations, or minor complications.</p><p>There are multiple limitations to this review. First, our analysis of PRAEs did yield moderate to substantial heterogeneity with a tau score of 0.64. This can be secondary to the different types of LMAs used in the different studies in addition to the different types of procedures performed. In addition, most studies only counted a PRAE once while one study allowed a patient to have multiple PRAEs.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> Not all studies included PRAEs measured postoperatively which likely also contributed to the heterogeneity seen in this outcome. There was not enough data provided from the studies to perform a subgroup analysis based on the procedure performed, that is, adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, or adenoidectomy alone. In addition, we were unable to control for additional procedures such as myringotomy and ear tube placement. Second, another limitation stems from the different exclusion criteria in the different studies. Many studies excluded patients with congenital deformities of the head and neck as well as patients with a high BMI. This does affect the generalizability of the study as it relates to the use of LMA in adenotonsillectomy. In that sense, the surgical team and anesthesiology team need to be mindful of who would be a good candidate for the use of LMA. Third, the measure of efficiency as they relate to total operating room time, intubation time, and extubation time had small sample sizes, especially when compared to the total participants in this study. This is secondary to many articles reporting outcomes relating to adverse events but very few reporting outcomes of efficiency. In addition, while total operative time and extubation time were measured similarly in the articles compared, intubation time was not. One article measured it from the time of induction to intubation,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> another from the time of entering the operating room to intubation,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> and the last one from the time of removing the face mask to intubation.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216241263851" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> This likely contributed to the heterogeneity seen in those values as well.</p><p>Finally, another limitation is the limited difference in total operating room time between both groups. While using the LMA significantly reduces total operating room time, it only does so by about 4 to 5&#8201;minutes on average. It is important to note that since this analysis was performed as intention-to-treat analysis, this also includes patients who were intended for LMA and converted to ETT and therefore had a longer total operating room time.</p><p>Our findings highlight the LMA as a safe and efficient alternative to ETT in select adenotonsillectomy patients which provides additional airway management options for surgeons and anesthesiologists. Future prospective studies would help compare LMA and ETT by controlling for potential confounding patient factors. At our center, LMA use is being investigated with surgeries done in more efficient minor procedure rooms, which have been previously shown to be cost effective.<sup>

Careful patient selection and judgment of the surgeon and anesthesiologist are paramount. Conversion to ETT may be necessary in approximately 8% of patients. Future research should focus on determining which patients may be suitable candidates for consideration of LMA for airway management during adenotonsillectomy, and ways to anticipate and/or decrease the potential need for conversion to ETT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section28-19160216241263851" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-19160216241263851" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241263851 &#8211; Supplemental material for The Safety of the Laryngeal Mask Airway in Adenotonsillectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241263851.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-ohn-10.1177_19160216241263851 for The Safety of the Laryngeal Mask Airway in Adenotonsillectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by Sami Khoury, Dorsa Zabihi-Pour, Jacob Davidson, Raju Poolacherla, Gopakumar Nair, Abhijit Biswas, Peng You and Julie E.
