Here, we investigated the non-thermal cellular effects of these RF-EMFs on human cells, including human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), Huh7 and Hep3B liver cancer stem cells (CSCs), HeLa and SH-SY5Y cancer cells, and normal fibroblast IMR-90 cells. When continuously exposed to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF for 72&#8201;h at 1 and 2 SAR, cell proliferation was consistently decreased in all the human cells. The anti-proliferative effect was higher at 2 SAR than 1 SAR and was less severe in ASCs. The exposure to RF-EMF for 72&#8201;h at 1 and 2 SAR did not induce DNA double strand breaks or apoptotic cell death, but did trigger a slight delay in the G1 to S cell cycle transition. Cell senescence was also clearly observed in ASC and Huh7 cells exposed to RF-EMF at 2 SAR for 72&#8201;h. Intracellular ROS increased in these cells and the treatment with an ROS scavenger recapitulated the anti-proliferative effect of RF-EMF. These observations strongly suggest that 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF decrease proliferation and increase senescence by increasing intracellular ROS in human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Risk factors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The development of wireless communication technology has made our life efficient and convenient. In return, we are continuously exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and environmental exposure to RF-EMFs has steadily increased. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as Group 2B carcinogens in 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, biological studies have not consistently supported or clarified the carcinogenic effect of RF-EMF. A review of 2012 suggested that the currently available data did not show genotoxic effect from RF-EMF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Two recent animal studies by the US National Toxicology Program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and the Ramazzini Institute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> investigated the carcinogenic potential of long-term exposure to RF-EMFs associated with mobile phones. The International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNRP) evaluated these two reports and recently announced that the conclusions concerning the carcinogenic potential of RF-EMFs could not be drawn due to the technical limitations of the studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, a recent report showed that rats exposed from prenatal life until natural death to 1.8&#8201;GHz global system for mobile (GSM) communication increased the incidence of heart malignant schwannoma among males exposed at the highest dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, the carcinogenic effects of RF-EMF are still unclear.</p><p id="Par3">Currently, 1700 to 1950 MHz RF-EMFs are the most widely used frequencies in mobile communications. Several studies have shown that 1800 MHz RF-EMF did not induce DNA damage or abnormal cellular behaviors in human neurogenic cells, skin fibroblast, and hematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

These inconsistencies may be due to differences in exposure devices, exposure conditions, or the source of the cells. In addition, recent wireless communication technology is using 4<sup>th</sup> generation communication long-term evolution (4G-LTE), which provides very fast internet speeds over currently used radio frequencies.

Compared with the unexposed control, ASC proliferation decreased 12% at 1 SAR and 54% at 2 SAR (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). The anti-proliferative effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF was more severe in Huh7 than ASCs: 21% at 1 SAR and 73% at 2 SAR (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These results showed that the anti-proliferation effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF was more serious at 2 SAR than at 1 SAR. To confirm the anti-proliferative effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF to human cells in general, we also examined the proliferation of Hep3B cells, another type of liver CSC population, HeLa uterine cancer cells, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and normal fibroblast IMR90 cells, after cells were exposed to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF for 72&#8201;h at 1 SAR and 2 SAR.

We detected the expression of phospho-histone 2AX (&#947;-H2AX) as a DNA DSB marker and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) as an apoptosis marker with western blots, after ASCs and Huh7 were exposed to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF for 72&#8201;h at 1 SAR. ASCs and Huh7 cells treated with UV or doxorubicin were used as a control for DNA DSBs and apoptotic cell death.

However, in order to understand the physiological outcomes and their mechanisms of 1.7 LTE GHz RF-EMF, studies of its effect on various human cells are needed. In this study, we developed an RF-EMF-generating device to minimize the thermal effect and investigated the non-thermal cellular effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF on various human cells including human adipose tissue-derived stem cells, liver cancer stem cell populations of Huh7 and Hep3B, HeLa and SH-SY5Y cancer cells, and normal fibroblast IMR-90 cells. We showed that the continuous exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF for 72&#8201;h at 1 and 2 SAR decreased cell proliferation in all the cell types studied, regardless of whether they were cancer or normal cells or their tissue of origin. We also showed that the anti-proliferation effects of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF were directly correlated with the SAR value increasing when SAR value was increased from 1 to 2. The RF-EMF-induced anti-proliferative effect was less severe in ASCs, a type of mesenchymal adult stem cells, which is consistent with the well-known observations that stem cells are in general less sensitive to various stresses. One interesting observation was that the neural origin SH-SY5Y cells were the most sensitive among the cell types studied at 2 SAR. Whether neural cells in general are more sensitive to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF than other cell types should be studied further, since brains and nerves are directly exposed to the wireless communication equipment.</p><p id="Par17">We also showed that the anti-proliferative effect of continuous exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF was induced by cell senescence and not by DNA damage and apoptosis. In fact, no obvious DNA DSBs or activation of apoptosis was detected in the exposed cells. Rather, we demonstrated that the decreased cell proliferation induced by exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF was due to a slight cell cycle delay at the G1 to S phase transition and the activation of cell senescence.</p><p id="Par18">The key question was then, how the exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF induces its anti-proliferative effect in human cells. We showed in this study that the exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF increases intracellular ROS and that intracellular ROS generation is directly correlated with SAR; more ROS was generated when SAR increased from 1 to 2. Of note, we detected a significantly enhanced generation of ROS in the mitochondria of cells exposed to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF, suggesting that exposure to RF-EMF affects the efficiency of the electron transport system of mitochondria. Further studies would be needed to understand how RF-EMF affects the electron transport system and the rate of ROS generation in mitochondria.</p><p id="Par19">While increased ROS generation in concert with the exposure to 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF in human cells is correlated with the anti-proliferative effect of RF-EMF, it may not be a direct evidence. To verify that the increased ROS is a direct cause of the anti-proliferative effect of RF-EMF, we pre-incubated cells with the anti-oxidant NAC before exposing them to the RF-EMF. We observed that the anti-oxidant could recuperate not only intracellular ROS but also the decreased proliferation, which strongly suggests that ROS are mainly responsible for the anti-proliferative effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF.</p><p id="Par20">Several studies that examined the effect of 1.8&#8201;GHz RF-EMF, a similar frequency range as we used, have also reported consistent anti-proliferative results as the effect of 1.7&#8201;GHz LTE RF-EMF of this study.

Altogether, these studies including ours using 1.7~1.8&#8201;GHz RF-EMF strongly suggest that the increased ROS generated by RF-EMF induce physiological changes in various mammalian cells, although the physiological outcome would be varied depending on the amount of ROS generated and the sensitivity of different cell types to the specific concentration of ROS. In order to understand the mechanism of cellular ROS generation by RF-EMF, further studies are needed to evaluate the expression and the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in cells exposed to 1.7&#8201;GHz RF-EMF. The Fenton and Haber-Weiss reaction plays a significant role in oxidative stress by generating &#8226;OH (hydroxyl radicals) from hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide (&#8226;O2<sup>&#8722;</sup>) by intracellular iron ions, serving as a mechanism for cellular aging, because the generated hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction cause damage to DNA, proteins and lipids in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Depending on the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and the extent of genotoxic damages, physiological responses of cells could be varied ranging from cell cycle arrest and repair to senescence and cell death.

The mean value and standard deviation of the SAR measurements for the entire sample were 0.155 &#177; 0.004&#8201;W/kg/W, which was normalized to the input power of 1&#8201;W at the feeding point.</p><p id="Par25">To examine the biological effects of the RF field through <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell experiments, the device was installed in an incubator that provides an environment similar to that in the body (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). To maintain constant temperature of the incubator, a water cooling system was installed to suppress the increased temperature by the electromagnetic fields (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The electromagnetic field exposure device has an antenna at its center, which generates an electromagnetic field and the culture dishes were placed a slight distance away from the center of the device. We had to set the exact field strength to expose the cells at the specific absorption rate (SAR) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D,E</xref>). To expose the cells with the desired SAR, a SAR conversion table was prepared using engineering calculations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).
