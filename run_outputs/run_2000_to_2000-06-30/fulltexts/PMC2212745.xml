Leijh et al. (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and Hammer et al. (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) reported that in stirred suspensions, which are thought to mimic the environment in blood, the neutrophil/bacteria ratio determines the efficiency of neutrophil bactericidal activity. However, the bacterial concentration in blood of bacteremic hosts is rarely &gt;100 CFU/ml (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Under this circumstance, the blood of a neutropenic (&#8764;10<sup>5</sup>&#8211;5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils/ml), bacteremic (&#8764;100 CFU bacteria/ml) host will have 1,000&#8211;5,000 neutrophils per bacterium. Because each neutrophil in suspension can kill &gt;20 bacteria (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), there is a large apparent excess in neutrophil capacity to kill bacteria. Yet, in neutropenic hosts, bacteria survive and grow in blood.</p><p>Previously, we reported that neutrophil bactericidal activity in stirred serum-containing suspensions, a condition that mimics the blood, is dependent on the neutrophil concentration and is independent of the ratio of neutrophils to bacteria (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We showed that the time course of the bacterial concentration in such suspensions could be modeled as the competition between a first-order reaction (bacterial growth) and a second-order reaction (neutrophil killing of bacteria). The resulting kinetic equation fit the time-course of bacterial concentration over wide ranges of initial concentrations of bacteria and neutrophils. The equation is as follows: b = b<sub>0</sub> e<sup>&#8722; (</sup>
<italic toggle="yes"><sup>k</sup></italic>
<sup>p &#8722;</sup>
<italic toggle="yes"><sup>g</sup></italic>
<sup>)t</sup> (Eq. 1), in which b is the bacterial concentration at any time t, b<sub>0</sub> is the initial bacterial concentration, p is the neutrophil concentration, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> is the second-order rate constant for neutrophil killing of bacteria, and <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> is the first-order rate constant for bacterial growth. Furthermore, the model provided a useful parameter, the critical neutrophil concentration (CNC), where CNC = <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> (Eq. 2).</p><p>When p = CNC, the bacteria grow and are killed at the same rates, and the bacterial concentration, b, is in a steady state. We demonstrated that at neutrophil concentrations below the CNC, the bacterial concentration increased with time, whereas at neutrophil concentrations above the CNC, the bacterial concentration decreased with time. Moreover, the killing rate constant, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>, the bacterial growth constant, g, and the CNC were independent of the initial bacterial concentration between 10<sup>3</sup>&#8211;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml. For example, in stirred suspensions containing varying concentrations of human neutrophils, 10<sup>3</sup>&#8211;10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 10&#8211;40% vol/vol normal human serum (NS), the CNC was &#8764;400,000 neutrophils/ml, a value close to the empirically determined blood neutrophil concentration of &#8764;500,000/ml that is known to predispose neutropenic patients to potentially fatal bacteremia.</p><p>Treating neutrophil killing of bacteria as a consequence of the collision of two particles, the bacterium and the neutrophil, made sense under the conditions of stirred suspensions (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but we asked whether this abstraction applied to more complex conditions in which neutrophils search for and kill bacteria in unstirred tissuelike environments and tissues. Comparatively little is known about neutrophil bactericidal mechanisms in tissues. Specifically, there are no analyses of the relationships between neutrophil concentration and neutrophil bactericidal activity in tissues, and the question of a CNC in tissues has not been considered. In the studies reported here, we used our kinetic model (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) to analyze neutrophil killing of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> in fibrin gels in vitro and to reanalyze previously reported data on neutrophil killing of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in rabbit dermis in vivo. We report that our model applies to the killing of bacteria by neutrophils in both situations and conclude that neutrophil concentration is one of the critical determinants of neutrophil bactericidal activity in tissue as well as in blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacteria, Sera, and Other Materials.</title><p>
<italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis H753</italic> was obtained, cultured, and assayed as described previously (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Plasma-derived NS was prepared from AB plasma, and C5-deficient, plasma-derived serum was prepared from C5-deficient human plasma (a gift from J. Leddy, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) was prepared as described previously (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Sera, except for that used in experiments shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, were dialyzed at 4&#176;C versus Dulbecco's PBS with calcium, magnesium, and 0.1% glucose (wt/vol) before use. Purified human C5 and pertussis toxin were obtained from Calbiochem. A concentration of &#8805;40% (vol/vol) NS was required for optimal opsonization of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To conserve C5-deficient serum, we used this reagent at a concentration of 10% (vol/vol). Neutrophil killing efficiency in stirred suspensions and in fibrin gels containing 10% NS or C5-deficient serum was approximately 70% of that observed in suspensions and gels containing 40% NS (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fibrin Gels.</title><p>Fibrin gels were formed using 1 mg/ml fibrinogen and contained 10 or 40% NS or C5-deficient serum as indicated.

Z-series images of 20 &#956;m-thick optical sections (optimal for resolving the relative locations of adjacent neutrophils in all directions) were captured at 20 &#956;m intervals by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a 25&#215; oil-immersion objective.

The values of k and g for the rate of killing of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> over time also were determined at different neutrophil concentrations as described before.

For p &#8805; CNC, 1 &#8722; b<sub>90</sub>/b<sub>0</sub> is the fractional decrease in bacterial concentration, and ranges from 0 to 1. However, for p &lt; CNC, b<sub>90</sub>/b<sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 and 1 &#8722; b<sub>90</sub>/b<sub>0</sub> is negative. To have a convenient measure of the extent of bacterial killing at all neutrophil concentrations, independent of bacterial growth, we compared the bacterial concentration after a 90-min incubation in the presence of neutrophils, b<sub>90</sub>, to the bacterial concentration after 90 min in the absence of neutrophils, b<sub>90, p = 0</sub>. We calculated a new parameter, &#954;<sub>90</sub>, as &#954;<sub>90</sub> = 1 &#8722; (b<sub>90</sub>/b<sub>90, p = 0</sub>) (Eq. 5). From Eq. 1, &#954;<sub>90</sub> also is given by &#954;<sub>90</sub> = 1 &#8722; e<sup>&#8722;90kp</sup> (Eq. 6).</p><p>Thus, the meaning of &#954;<sub>90</sub> is the fraction of bacteria initially present that would be killed by neutrophils at concentration p in the absence of bacterial growth (i.e., if g = 0).

Modeling the former as an analogue of a bimolecular reaction and the latter as an analogue of a unimolecular reaction yielded Eq. 1, which closely fitted findings for neutrophil killing of bacteria in stirred suspensions (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the present work, we have examined whether the same model also describes neutrophil bactericidal activity in fibrin gels. Because the kinetic model leading to Eq. 1 assumes a uniform distribution of a constant number of viable neutrophils throughout the course of an experiment, we confirmed experimentally that neutrophils were distributed uniformly in fibrin gels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and were viable (not depicted) throughout the 90-min course of experiments. We also confirmed that &gt;99% of bacteria embedded in fibrin gels with or without neutrophils were recovered from these gels at zero time (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Distribution of neutrophils in fibrin gels.

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> a, the number of bacteria remaining viable at 90 min compared with the initial bacterial inoculum depended primarily on the concentration of neutrophils.

Killing is not a result of secretion of bactericidal agents. Two lines of evidence indicate this also applies to fibrin gels.

By chance, it was 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml of dermis at both 1 and 2 h after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation, indicating that immigrating neutrophils had reached the critical concentration during this interval. The neutrophil concentration during this interval averaged &#8764;7.4 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml rabbit dermis (i.e., [2.3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml + 12.5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml]/2; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b). The very close correspondence between the empirically observed CNC (i.e., the average neutrophil concentration of 7.4 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml dermis 1&#8211;2 h after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation), and the CNC calculated using values of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> obtained by substituting experimentally determined values for b<sub>t</sub>, b<sub>0</sub>, p, <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, and t into Eq. 1 (i.e., 7.7 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml dermis at 1 h after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>) supports the argument that Eq. 1 describes neutrophil bactericidal efficiency in rabbit dermis.</p><p>The applicability of the CNC concept to bacterial infections in vivo is further indicated the Movat et al. (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) finding that neutropenic rabbits inoculated intradermally with <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> were unable to control the growth of these bacteria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> a). This suggests that neutrophils did not reach the CNC in the dermis of these rabbits. Indeed, the accuracy of this prediction is documented in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b.</p><p>The CNCs for human neutrophils to control growth of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in stirred suspensions are nearly identical (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Moreover, there is only a 1.8-fold difference between the CNC for rabbit neutrophils to control growth of &#8764;10<sup>8</sup> CFU <italic toggle="yes">E. coli/</italic>ml rabbit dermis in vivo (i.e., 7.4&#8211;7.7 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml), and for human neutrophils to control growth of &#8764;10<sup>8</sup> CFU <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermis/</italic>ml fibrin gels (i.e., 4.2 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml). The 1.2-fold difference in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> for neutrophil killing of <italic toggle="yes">E.coli</italic> in rabbit dermis versus for killing of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> in fibrin gels (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2.7 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> vs. 2.2 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> ml/neutrophil/min, respectively), and the 1.5-fold difference in <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (i.e., 0.017/min vs. 0.01/min, respectively).

A simple kinetic model treating killing and growth of bacteria as competing reactions fits the time course of neutrophil killing of bacteria in different environments and gives rise to the concept of the CNC.</p><sec><title>Neutrophil Bactericidal Activity in Diverse Environments.</title><p>Bacteria and neutrophils diffuse freely in stirred suspensions, but not in fibrin gels. Thus, it was not obvious that Eq. 1, which was derived to describe neutrophil bactericidal activity in stirred suspensions (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), would accurately model neutrophil bactericidal activity in fibrin gels and in tissues. The model leading to Eq. 1 assumes a rate constant, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>, for bacterial killing that is independent of neutrophil and bacterial concentrations. This assumption proved true only when the initial bacterial concentration was &#8804;10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml in stirred suspensions or &#8804;10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml in fibrin gels.

A more complicated model would be needed to include such effects. However, the premise of such a model would still be that neutrophil killing of bacteria is kinetically analogous to a bimolecular reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Factors That Affect the Rate and Extent of Neutrophil Accumulation in E. coli&#8211;infected Rabbit Dermis.</title><p>The finding that it takes &lt;2 h for neutrophils to reach the CNC of &#8764;8 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml in the dermis of rabbits inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b) gave us the impetus to assess the relative contributions of the various physiological adaptations (e.g., endothelial cell activation, chemoattractant expression, and changes in blood flow and in blood neutrophil concentration) that facilitate accumulation of so large a number of neutrophils at these sites in so short a time span. Movat et al. (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) reported that in the first 4 h after intradermal inoculation of normal rabbits with <italic toggle="yes">E. coli,</italic> tissue neutrophil concentration increased at least 150-fold (i.e., from &#8764;2 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>/ml dermis to &#8764;3 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>/ml dermis; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b). During this period, blood neutrophil concentration varied from 0.5- to 1.5-fold of control, and blood flow at the site of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation increased approximately fivefold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c). At most, these changes in blood neutrophil concentration and blood flow could have caused a 7.5-fold increase in neutrophil delivery to <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;infected dermis (i.e., 1.5-fold increase in blood neutrophil concentration &#215; fivefold increase in blood flow). However, the observed rate of neutrophil accumulation in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;infected dermis was not closely linked to increased blood flow or to changes in blood neutrophil concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c and reference <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). For example, the rate of neutrophil accumulation was most rapid during the first hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation, a period when blood neutrophil concentration averaged only &#8764;75% of its control value (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and blood flow to <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis remained at control levels. These findings strongly suggest important roles for increased neutrophil adhesion to, and chemotaxis across, the endothelium of dermal capillaries perfusing <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation sites. Indeed, up-regulation of endothelial selectins and other adhesion-promoting receptors, and formation of chemoattractants by endothelium, have been shown to occur within minutes of endothelial cell exposure to lipopolysaccharide.</p><p>To assess the relative magnitude of the many types of physiological adaptations that are likely to be responsible for recruitment of a critical concentration of neutrophils to dermal sites of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> infection within the first 2 h after inoculation, we used a method introduced by Doerschuk et al. (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) to estimate the overall efficiency of neutrophil emigration into segments of <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic>&#8211;infected rabbit lung (Materials and Methods). We have termed this NEE. The NEE was &#8764;0.45 in the first hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c). That is, &#8764;45% of neutrophils in the unmarginated blood pool perfusing 1 ml of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis accumulated in it during the first hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation. Because blood flow through <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis was unchanged from preinoculation levels during the first hour (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c), and the concentration of neutrophils in the unmarginated pool decreased during this period (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), changes in expression of adhesion-promoting receptors and chemoattractants by endothelial cells in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;infected dermis must have been the primary factors responsible for the increased rate of neutrophil emigration during this period.</p><p>By the end of the second hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation, blood flow through <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis had increased approximately threefold (i.e., from &#8764;3.6 ml/h per ml dermis to &#8764;11/ml/h per ml dermis; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c), and blood neutrophil concentration had returned to its preinoculation level (i.e., 2.5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils/ml). Thus, in the second hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation, the total volume of blood perfusing each ml of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis contained &#8764;37 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils. 8 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> of them migrated from the blood into each ml of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis during this second hour, approximately threefold more than had migrated into these sites during the first hour; and the NEE declined from 45% in the first hour to &#8764;15% in the second (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c). Had the same fraction of neutrophils migrated from the blood into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli&#8211;</italic>inoculated sites in the second hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation as in the first hour (i.e., &#8764;45%), &#8764;1.6 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> neutrophils would have accumulated in each ml of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis during this second hour. The finding that only 8 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils accumulated per ml <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis during this second hour suggests that endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines were less efficient in stimulating neutrophil immigration in the second hour than in the first.</p></sec><sec><title>What Regulates NEE?</title><p>The findings described in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and discussed before suggest that of the several physiological adaptations thought to promote neutrophil accumulation at sites of infection and inflammation (e.g., increases in blood flow, changes in blood neutrophil concentration and vascular permeability, and expression of adhesion-promoting receptors and of chemokines by endothelium; references <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), expression of chemokines and adhesion-promoting receptors by postcapillary venular endothelial cells exert the largest effects. The Movat et al. (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) finding that neutrophils accumulated at a similar rate and to a similar extent in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis of cobra venom factor-de-complemented rabbits as in normal rabbits suggests that C3a and C5a played minor roles, at best, in promoting neutrophil entry into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>&#8211;inoculated dermis. They are consistent with a dominant role for endothelial cell-derived factors (e.g., IL-8) in this process.</p><p>NEE at <italic toggle="yes">E. coli&#8211;</italic>inoculated skin sites in normal rabbits declined markedly in the second and subsequent hours after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c) despite continued increases in blood (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and tissue neutrophil concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b), and local blood flow (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c and references <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, and <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although we had insufficient data to calculate the NEE in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli&#8211;</italic>inoculated neutropenic rabbits, it is evident that the rate of neutrophil accumulation also declined in the second hour after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation in these rabbits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b).</p><p>Many of the mechanisms and molecules responsible for increases in NEE (e.g., expression of adhesion promoting receptors and chemokines by activated endothelial cells and up-regulation of neutrophil adhesion-promoting receptors by chemokines and chemoattractants), have been identified (for review see reference <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Less is known about the mechanisms and molecules responsible for decreases in NEE.</p><p>The findings of Levy et al. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) suggest an important role for lipoxins inhibiting inflammation. They are formed by endothelial cells and monocytes from 5-lipoxygenase products (e.g., leukotrienes A4 and B4) produced by chemokine/cytokine-stimulated neutrophils. They are formed at sites of inflammation after entry of the first wave of neutrophils, but before the rate of neutrophil entry declines (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Lipoxins inhibit IL-8 release by endothelial cells, monocytes, and neutrophils; reduce endothelial cell adhesiveness for neutrophils; attenuate CD11/CD18 expression by neutrophils; and inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis and migration across endothelium (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). At the same time, they stimulate monocyte chemotaxis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These activities are consistent with ones that might be expected to produce the effects observed two or more hours after <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> inoculation into rabbit dermis (i.e., a decrease in the rate of neutrophil accumulation, and continued monocyte entry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b and reference <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</p></sec><sec><title>Why Does Neutropenia Predispose to Bacteremia?</title><p>The findings reported here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> a, 3 a, and 6, a&#8211;c, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">III</xref>) as well as those reported previously (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), provide three related insights into the relationships between neutropenia and bacteremia. First, they show that the CNC required to control bacterial growth is 10&#8211;19-fold higher in tissues than in blood. Second, they suggest that a decrease in NEE, which occurs between 2 and 3 h after commencement of neutrophil immigration, may prevent neutrophils from ever reaching the CNC in tissues when the blood neutrophil concentration is &#8804;5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils/ml. Accordingly, in neutropenic hosts, the small number of bacteria that penetrate skin and mucous membranes will grow to a higher concentration and persist longer in tissues than in hosts with a normal blood neutrophil concentration. By this means, neutropenia increases opportunities for bacterial entry into the vascular compartment. This scenario is consistent with Crosby's suggestion that tissue neutrophil concentration is the primary determinant of host defense against bacteremia (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and with the Koene et al. (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) finding that bacteremia in neutropenic patients correlates more closely with total body mass of neutrophils than with blood neutrophil concentration. Third, they show that when the blood neutrophil concentration in a neutropenic host falls below the CNC (i.e., &lt;4-5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils/ml), bacteria that enter the blood will continue to grow. Under these circumstances, the fixed phagocytes of the liver and spleen will be the last line of host defense. Bacteria that escape them will inexorably increase in concentration in the blood at a rate described by Eq. 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Other Applications of Eq. 1 and of the CNC Concept.</title><p>Information about the CNC for known or suspected bacterial pathogens may be helpful in determining whether and when to administer granulocytes and/or antibiotics to neutropenic patients. Such information will enable clinicians to estimate the minimum neutrophil concentration needed to control bacterial growth in specific organs and tissues, and may encourage them to consider whether administration of agents that block continued ingress of neutrophils into a site of infection, inflammation, or infarction may be therapeutically beneficial. For example, Wright et al. (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) reported that limiting neutrophil influx into the cerebrospinal fluid of rabbits with pneumococcal meningitis reduced mortality from this infection in these animals.</p><p>The concept of a critical leukocyte concentration may be applicable to other situations. For example, a critical concentration of antigen-presenting cells expressing a given antigen may be required to elicit a physiologically meaningful T or B cell response to that antigen, a critical concentration of platelets may be required to maintain vascular integrity, and a critical concentration of cytotoxic lymphocytes may be required to block growth of tumors. The concepts and systems described here should facilitate exploration of these questions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. J. Leddy for C5-deficient human sera, Dr. R.
