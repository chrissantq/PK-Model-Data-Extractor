It was asked if the measured fluxes are sufficient to account for the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovery kinetics after depolarization-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the plasma membrane was described by a parallel extrusion/leak system, while the rates of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release were represented using equations like those describing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by isolated mitochondria. Taken together, these rate descriptions account very well for the time course of recovery after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations evoked by weak and strong depolarization and their differential sensitivity to FCCP, CGP 37157, and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The model also leads to three general conclusions about mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in intact cells: (1) mitochondria are expected to accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> even in response to stimuli that raise [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> only slightly above resting levels; (2) there are two qualitatively different stimulus regimes that parallel the buffering and non-buffering modes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by isolated mitochondria that have been described previously; (3) the impact of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport on intracellular calcium dynamics is strongly influenced by nonmitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport; in particular, the magnitude of the prolonged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation that occurs during the plateau phase of recovery is related to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> set-point described in studies of isolated mitochondria, but is a property of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in a cellular context. Finally, the model resolves the paradoxical finding that stimulus-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations as small as &#8764;300 nM increase intramitochondrial total Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but the steady [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations evoked by such stimuli are not influenced by FCCP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ionized free calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an important signal that links a variety of extracellular stimuli to their intracellular effectors. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> accomplishes this function by interacting with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins, the cellular effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depend critically on the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]). One of the central goals in the study of calcium signaling is to understand the basis of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics. This is complicated by several factors: (a) Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present in multiple membrane-delimited intracellular compartments, each of which employs distinctive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport systems; (b) Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be distributed in a spatially nonuniform manner within these compartments; (c) the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport between compartments can exhibit a complex nonlinear dependence on free Ca concentration.</p><p>We have studied how mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport contributes to the redistribution of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> during and after depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in sympathetic neurons. Here, the rise in cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry but is strongly influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release by organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We simplified the analysis of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics by inhibiting SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation by the ER, and by focusing on the slow recovery that follows repolarization, a period during which the spatial distribution of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is approximately uniform. Analysis of this case is relevant to slow changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that occur in the aftermath of depolarizing stimuli, and is a logical step in understanding the more complex case where [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] undergoes rapid, spatially nonuniform changes within multiple intracellular compartments.</p><p>In the preceding study, the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux during the recovery after depolarization was dissected into three components, one representing net Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane, the others representing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release via the uniporter and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger. In this study, these flux components are described analytically to determine if they are sufficient to account for the time course of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovery after weak and strong stimuli, and the effects of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport inhibitors on these recoveries. It is found that they are. Moreover, the results are in general quantitative agreement with the dynamics of total mitochondrial Ca concentration deduced from x-ray microanalysis under the same conditions of stimulation. The results provide a conceptual framework for describing how mitochondrial Ca transport operates in the context of intact cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Preparation of cells and measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes follow the procedures described in the preceding paper. Empirical rate equations for net plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release were obtained by fitting equations to flux data obtained from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recordings that were smoothed 1&#8211;2 times with a binomial filter. The rate equations were then incorporated into a system of differential equations that was solved numerically using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta routine (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BoyceandDiPrima1969">Boyce and DiPrima 1969</xref>) written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.). Step size was 50 ms; further reductions in step size did not noticeably alter the results. Cells were pretreated with thapsigargin (Tg) to minimize contributions from ER Ca transport, so the model does not include this organelle. The details of the model and the underlying assumptions are described in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="APPAppendix"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Quantitative Description of the Flux Components</title><p>We begin with analytical descriptions of the three components of the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. In each case, rate equations will be used that are motivated by known properties of plasma membrane and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. It is then asked if the quantitative properties of the individual fluxes are sufficient to account for the kinetic properties of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovery. For this purpose, the equations may be regarded as completely empirical. However, in the Discussion, the equations and parameters describing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport will be considered in light of information obtained from previous studies of isolated organelles.</p></sec><sec><title>The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> -dependent Fluxes: J<sub>pm</sub> and J<sub>uni</sub>
</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A shows how the rate of net Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane (J<sub>pm</sub>) depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during the recovery after high K<sup>+</sup> depolarization, averaged over 10 cells (solid symbols). The smooth curve is a plot of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1"/> (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="APPAppendix"/>) that describes the net flux generated by a linear leak operating in parallel with a saturable extrusion system. According to this equation, J<sub>pm</sub> increases monotonically with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, crossing zero at a (stable) resting level (50 nM). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1"/> regards J<sub>pm</sub> as an instantaneous function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i,</sub> conforming with the observed properties of this flux (see Figure 2 B of preceding study). While there is evidence for distinct components of J<sub>pm</sub> that are differentially sensitive to extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and La<sup>3+</sup> (Friel, D.D., unpublished observations), <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1"/> lumps together all energetically uphill Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport into a single equation and should therefore be regarded as an empirical description of the measured flux. Clearly, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of J<sub>pm</sub> is adequately described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1"/> for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> up to 800 nM. Similar results were obtained from three cells studied under voltage clamp (open symbols).</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B shows the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of J<sub>uni</sub> based on collected results from three cells studied under voltage clamp (open symbols). J<sub>uni</sub> increases steeply and monotonically with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a manner that can be described by a modified sigmoidal function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2"/>). According to this equation, J<sub>uni</sub> depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> but not [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, consistent with the finding that J<sub>uni</sub> exhibits the same [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence after stimuli that are expected to produce very different mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads (see Figure 7, D and E, of preceding study). There is no indication that J<sub>uni</sub> saturates over this [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> range, so no attempt was made to estimate a limiting slope (k<sub>max,uni</sub>) or a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> level where activation is half-maximal (EC<sub>50,uni</sub>). However, Hill plot analysis provides an estimate of the Hill coefficient (n<sub>uni</sub> = 1.93 &#177; 0.18) that is quite insensitive to these parameters (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandGunter1994">Gunter and Gunter 1994</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ScarpaandGraziotti1973">Scarpa and Graziotti 1973</xref>). The smooth curve shows the result of fitting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2"/> to the flux data with EC<sub>50,uni</sub> held at 10 &#956;M (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandPfeiffer1990">Gunter and Pfeiffer 1990</xref>) and n<sub>uni</sub> = 2, yielding k<sub>max,uni</sub> = 75.9. With the same parameters, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2"/> also provides a good description of mean J<sub>uni</sub> from 10 cells measured after high K<sup>+</sup> depolarization (solid symbols).</p></sec><sec><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> Release via the Mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> Exchanger</title><p>In the preceding study, it was shown that J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> exhibits an apparent U-shaped dependence on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Although J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> varies with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, it is not clear that J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> actually depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (i.e., is a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). Previous studies of isolated mitochondria have shown that with constant extramitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via the Na<sup>+/</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger is a saturable function of the intramitochondrial free Ca concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="WingroveandGunter1986">Wingrove and Gunter 1986</xref>). To examine the dependence of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> on intramitochondrial Ca levels, cells were depolarized for increasing periods of time to produce graded mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads, and the components of the net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux during the subsequent recoveries were compared. Specifically, it was asked if J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> increases saturably with the depolarization-evoked mitochondrial Ca load.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A shows [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses from an exemplar cell elicited by four 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> depolarizations of different duration. While the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during the depolarizations and the initial recovery after repolarization were similar in each case (see inset), the subsequent phases of recovery depended strongly on stimulus duration. In particular, the slow plateau phase became longer as the duration of the preceding depolarization was increased, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>). For example, the time required for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to fall below 25% of its value at the instant of repolarization increased from 79 to 256 s as the depolarization length increased from 3.3 to 20.7 s. There was also a small increase in the plateau level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. B</xref>). B shows the recoveries from A aligned in time. Beneath the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> records are time plots of the net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (J<sub>mito</sub>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C), integrated J<sub>mito</sub> (&#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>, D), and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger flux ( J<sub>Na/Ca</sub>, E). As discussed in the preceding study, &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> provides a measure of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> relative to its basal value, referred to the effective cytosolic volume. For each stimulus duration, the initial rapid decline in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is coincident with a large outward net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C), an increase in mitochondrial Ca concentration (D) and an increase in the magnitude of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> (E). In contrast, the plateau phase of recovery is associated with net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, a decline in mitochondrial Ca concentration, and a nearly constant inward flux via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, each of which becomes more prolonged as the stimulus length is increased. Note that the initial value of &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>(i.e., the value at the end of the depolarization) is proportional to stimulus duration when the stimulus lasts at least 7.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D, inset). Using the measured ratio of mitochondrial and cytosolic volumes (0.1) and the estimated ratio of total and free cytosolic Ca concentration in sympathetic neurons (&#8764;200; Friel, D.D., and S.B. Andrews, unpublished observations), the proportionality constant (71 nM/s) converts to (71)(200/0.1) = 142 &#956;M/s, in reasonable agreement with the rate at which total mitochondrial Ca concentration rises during 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> depolarization in these cells as determined from electron probe microanalysis (184 &#956;M/s; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, J<sub>mito</sub> and its inward component J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> are both limited as the stimulus duration increases. For example, increasing the stimulus length from 11.5 to 20.7 s nearly doubles the mitochondrial Ca load, but has relatively little effect on the peak magnitude of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, compare D with E). Saturation of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> can be seen more clearly by plotting J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> versus &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>during the recovery for each stimulus duration (F). In each case, J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> increases saturably with &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>in a manner that is described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD7"/> over most of the &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>range (see smooth curve). This equation, which assumes that J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> depends on intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration but not [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, provides a simple description of the measured flux over all but the initial phase of recovery. Estimating the ratio of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic effective volumes (&#947;) as 2 (see previous study) gives &#916;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> = &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>/2 (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD4"/>), V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> = &#8722;34.8 nM/s, EC<sub>50,Na/Ca</sub> = 307.5 nM and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>(&#8734;) = 9.2 nM. Results from two other cells were similar except that V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> was somewhat larger (&#8764; &#8722;75 nM/s).</p><p>While the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is described quite well by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD7"/> during most of the recovery, it deviates systematically from this description during the initial phase when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> highest. During this phase, the rapid decline in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is accompanied by a similarly rapid rise in J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. F</xref> arrows). The basis for this deviation, which is relevant to the apparent U-shaped [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> (see preceding study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>) is not certain. However, previous studies have shown that the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger is inhibited by extramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="HayatandCrompton1982">Hayat and Crompton 1982</xref>). A modified rate law that includes [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-dependent inhibition of the exchanger at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD8"/>) provides a reasonable description of the results during the entire recovery (not shown). However, it will be shown below that the observed attenuation of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is not expected to influence recovery kinetics very much since under these conditions J<sub>uni</sub> is the dominant component of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> represents only a small fraction of the total flux.</p><p>Below, we examine the behavior of a model in which plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport is described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1"/>, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2"/>, and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD7"/> or <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD8"/>, with parameter values obtained directly from the experimental data presented above. It is found that the model accounts very well for most of the features of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovery kinetics in sympathetic neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Simulated Changes in Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> Concentration Induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> Entry</title><p>To determine if the quantitative properties of J<sub>pm,</sub> J<sub>uni</sub>, and J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> are sufficient to account for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics during the recovery, the rate equations described above were taken as the flux definitions in a previous model of Ca dynamics in sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>). In this model, mitochondria contain Ca<sup>2+</sup> at concentration c<sub>m</sub> and are exposed to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at concentration c<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, left). It is assumed that c<sub>i</sub> is spatially uniform within the cytosol, which is a reasonably accurate description of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during the recovery since [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> gradients dissipate rapidly (&#8764;1 s) after repolarization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hernandez-Cruzetal1990">Hernandez-Cruz et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Huaetal1993">Hua et al. 1993</xref>). With regard to the spatial distribution of intramitochondrial Ca, reversible formation of Ca- and P-rich intramitochondrial inclusions has been observed under these conditions of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>), but there is no evidence that the distribution of intramitochondrial free Ca outside the inclusions is spatially heterogeneous. Therefore, it will be assumed for simplicity that c<sub>m</sub> is spatially uniform within the mitochondrial compartment.</p><p>In the model, Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane occurs at rate J<sub>extru</sub> and passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry occurs at rate J<sub>leak</sub>. These two fluxes define the net Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux across the plasma membrane (J<sub>pm</sub>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is described by J<sub>uni</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is described by J<sub>Na/Ca</sub>; these two fluxes define the net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Since J<sub>pm</sub> and J<sub>uni</sub> are both defined by c<sub>i</sub>, they are plotted together against c<sub>i</sub> in B (left) along with their sum (thick trace). J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> is plotted both versus c<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C, left, shown as a positive flux for simplicity) and versus c<sub>i</sub> (D) for comparison with the results in the preceding study (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>); solid traces describe the case where J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> depends only on c<sub>m</sub> and dotted traces illustrate the case where this flux depends on both c<sub>m</sub> and c<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Simulated changes in c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> after step increases in the rate constant of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, right) are plotted in B and C (right); note that the c<sub>i</sub>- and c<sub>m</sub>-dependent fluxes can be read from the corresponding plots at left. During a small stimulus (s1) that elevates c<sub>i</sub> to a low level (&#8764;160 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B, right), J<sub>uni</sub> is only weakly activated (B, left) so that c<sub>m</sub> increases to a low level (&lt;50 nM, C right). In this case, when the stimulus ends, the net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is small compared with J<sub>pm</sub> so the c<sub>i</sub> recovery is dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane, accounting for the simple recovery kinetics. With a stronger stimulus (s2) that raises c<sub>i</sub> to a higher level, J<sub>uni</sub> is activated more strongly, causing robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and a rapid rise in c<sub>m</sub>. Due to its steep c<sub>i</sub> dependence, J<sub>uni</sub> is nearly four times larger than J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> at the highest c<sub>i</sub> levels achieved during stimulation, setting the stage for continuous mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. When this stimulus ends, continued Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation contributes to a rapid rise in c<sub>m</sub> and decline in c<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> E; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C from <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Babcocketal1997">Babcock et al. 1997</xref>). This decline in c<sub>i</sub>, in turn, deactivates J<sub>uni</sub> and shifts the balance from mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation to net release, which initiates the slow plateau phase of recovery. Finally, as c<sub>i</sub> approaches its resting level, net Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane dominates. A longer stimulus (s3) raises c<sub>i</sub> to about the same level but for a longer period of time, leading to a larger increase in c<sub>m</sub>. As a result, the c<sub>i</sub> recovery is even more prolonged. Overall, the recovery kinetics are very similar to those observed experimentally in terms of sensitivity to stimulus strength and duration, the four distinct phases of recovery, and the level of the plateau (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A of this study).</p><p>If the rate description of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> is modified to include inhibition by c<sub>i</sub>, J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> is no longer completely defined by c<sub>m</sub> and is depressed during the initial rapid phase of recovery when c<sub>i</sub> is high, showing an apparent U-shaped dependence on c<sub>i</sub> like the measured flux (dotted curves s2<sup>*</sup>, s3<sup>*</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. D</xref>). However, the time courses of c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> are nearly unchanged (see dotted curves in B and C right, insets). The explanation is simple: J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> constitutes only a small fraction of the total mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux over the c<sub>i</sub> range where inhibition occurs, so that inhibition has little impact on the total flux. Since inhibition of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> during the initial phase the recovery does not appreciably influence the dynamics of c<sub>i</sub> or c<sub>m</sub>, for simplicity, it will be ignored in the following, and it will be assumed that J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> depends only on c<sub>m</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Responses to Stimuli of Variable Magnitude and Duration</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A illustrates responses to stimuli of fixed duration and increasing strength. Weak stimuli that raise c<sub>i</sub> to low levels barely activate the uniporter so that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation is slow. Thus, when the stimulus ends, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release rates are low, so the recovery kinetics depend almost entirely on Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane. Stronger stimuli that raise c<sub>i</sub> to higher levels increasingly activate the uniporter, causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at progressively higher rates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A, bottom). During each stimulus, c<sub>i</sub> and the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation both approach steady values, and when the stimulus ends, continued mitochondrial Ca accumulation speeds the initial c<sub>i</sub> decline. This leads to partial deactivation of the uniporter, causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation to give way to net release, which then slows the c<sub>i</sub> recovery. As discussed in the next section, when the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load is large, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, and the rate of net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, are both nearly constant, causing c<sub>i</sub> to hang up at an elevated plateau level until c<sub>m</sub> falls and saturation of the exchanger is relieved. The c<sub>i</sub> plateau level, defined as the c<sub>i</sub> level where the recovery rate reaches a minimum, increases with stimulus strength and appears to approach a limiting value where c<sub>i</sub> declines at a vanishingly slow rate (see below).</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B illustrates responses to stimuli of fixed magnitude and variable duration. In this case, the briefest stimulus raises c<sub>i</sub> sufficiently to activate the uniporter, and increasing the stimulus duration increases the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load. As the stimulus length increases, c<sub>i</sub> approaches a steady elevated level and c<sub>m</sub> rises linearly with time (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D, inset). When the stimulus ends, c<sub>i</sub> undergoes a rapid decline to a plateau level that depends on stimulus duration (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A) and eventually recovers to basal levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison between Simulated Responses to Weak and Strong Stimulation: Analysis of the Underlying Fluxes</title><p>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has often been viewed as a low-affinity process that is only important when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rises to high levels, either in microdomains near mitochondria during physiological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rizzutoetal1998">Rizzuto et al. 1998</xref>), or after Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload under extreme conditions (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MoravecandBond1992">Moravec and Bond 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Horikawaetal1998">Horikawa et al. 1998</xref>). One reason is that the EC<sub>50</sub> for the uniporter is high (&#8764;10&#8211;20 &#956;M; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandPfeiffer1990">Gunter and Pfeiffer 1990</xref>). How is mitochondrial Ca concentration expected to change during stimulation that raises [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> only slightly above the resting level? A simulated response to a long, weak stimulus is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A. During the stimulus, both c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> rise to new steady state levels (c<sub>m</sub> &lt; c<sub>i</sub>) and return to their prestimulation values after the stimulus ends. The changes in c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> can be understood by considering the underlying fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). Before stimulation, there is a steady state distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the total cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (J<sub>total</sub>) and its components J<sub>pm</sub> and J<sub>mito</sub>, are all zero. When the stimulus begins (On arrow), J<sub>total</sub> (thick trace) suddenly becomes an inward flux so that c<sub>i</sub> rises and then gradually declines toward zero as c<sub>i</sub> approaches a new elevated steady state level. When the stimulus ends, J<sub>total</sub> suddenly becomes an outward flux (Off arrow), which causes c<sub>i</sub> to return to its basal level. Note that during the onset, J<sub>pm</sub> includes contributions from both basal and stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion.</p><p>The changes in J<sub>total</sub> can be understood by examining the component fluxes. With the onset of stimulation, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry suddenly increases, creating an imbalance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and extrusion which causes J<sub>pm</sub> (dotted trace), and therefore J<sub>total</sub>, to suddenly become inwardly directed (On arrow). As c<sub>i</sub> rises, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion increases, eventually equaling the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, so that J<sub>pm</sub> declines to zero. The rise in c<sub>i</sub> also creates an imbalance between mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release, leading to net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation (J<sub>mito</sub> positive, dashed trace) which slows the rise in c<sub>i</sub>. As c<sub>m</sub> rises, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release eventually balances uptake and J<sub>mito</sub> falls to zero. Termination of the stimulus creates a sudden imbalance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and extrusion which causes J<sub>pm</sub> (and J<sub>total</sub>) to become outward fluxes (Off arrow) so that c<sub>i</sub> declines. As the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion approaches the rate of entry, J<sub>pm</sub> approaches zero. The decline in c<sub>i</sub> also creates an imbalance between mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release, leading to net Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (J<sub>mito</sub> negative, dashed trace), which slows the c<sub>i</sub> recovery. As c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> return to their resting levels, the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release both decline and J<sub>pm</sub> and J<sub>mito</sub> approach zero. Thus, a weak stimulus leads to a reversible transition between two steady states in which all intercompartmental net fluxes are zero.</p><p>Strong stimuli produce qualitatively different responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. D</xref>). For clarity, the fluxes underlying the response onset and recovery are shown separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D, left and right, respectively). When the stimulus begins, J<sub>total</sub> instantly becomes a large inward flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D left, thick trace, On arrow) and then declines to zero as c<sub>i</sub> stabilizes at a new elevated level. However, in this case, J<sub>total</sub> approaches zero not because the component fluxes individually fall to zero, but because the outward flux J<sub>mito</sub> eventually balances the inward flux J<sub>pm</sub>. This occurs when c<sub>i</sub> is so high that J<sub>uni</sub> exceeds the maximal rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, setting the stage for continuous mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at a rate that equals the rate of net Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. When the stimulus ends, J<sub>total</sub> suddenly becomes a large outward flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D right, thick trace, Off arrow) which causes c<sub>i</sub> to fall rapidly. However, J<sub>total</sub> does not decline continuously, but instead reaches a minimum and then rises again to reach a maximum before finally approaching zero. J<sub>total</sub> is biphasic because it is the sum of J<sub>pm</sub>, which increases montonically with c<sub>i</sub>, and J<sub>mito</sub>, which is biphasic, representing an initial phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and a late phase of net Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. The similarity between the simulated and measured fluxes during the recovery is clear (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D in the preceding study).</p><p>The interplay between the components of the total flux explains the four phases of the c<sub>i</sub> recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. D</xref> right). During phase i, both J<sub>mito</sub> and J<sub>pm</sub> are positive, accounting for the initial rapid c<sub>i</sub> decline. The reduction in c<sub>i</sub> causes partial deactivation of J<sub>uni</sub> and a reduction in the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. When the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release are equal, J<sub>mito</sub> is zero, but the decline in c<sub>i</sub> continues because of ongoing net Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. Further deactivation of J<sub>uni</sub> causes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation to give way to net release (phase ii) which slows the recovery. However, as c<sub>m</sub> falls, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release declines so that J<sub>mito</sub> approaches zero. As a result, J<sub>total</sub> rises, accounting for the accelerated recovery during phase iii. Finally, as J<sub>mito</sub> approaches zero, the recovery is dominated by net Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion across the plasma membrane (phase iv).</p></sec><sec><title>Simulated Effects of CGP on Responses to Weak Stimulation</title><p>In the preceding study, it was shown that despite being largely insensitive to FCCP, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses elicited by weak depolarization are strongly depressed by CGP. This makes sense in light of the preceding discussion. After inhibiting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, weak stimuli that would otherwise lead to transient mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation are expected to cause continuous accumulation and depressed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations, as in the strong stimulus regime described above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> shows simulated responses to a long, weak stimulus that under control conditions raises c<sub>i</sub> to a steady state level of &#8764;230 nM and c<sub>m</sub> to &#8764;100 nM. To model the actions of CGP, V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> was set to zero. In this case (J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> = 0), the same stimulus elicited a smaller steady rise in c<sub>i</sub> that was accompanied by a continuous rise in c<sub>m</sub>. V<sub>max,uni</sub> was then set to zero to model the additional effects of FCCP (J<sub>uni</sub> = 0). This abolished the stimulus-evoked rise in c<sub>m</sub> and speeded the elevation in c<sub>i</sub>, reversing the simulated actions of CGP. Moreover, after inhibiting uptake, c<sub>i</sub> rose to the same steady state level during stimulation as it did in the control. These simulations reproduce the observed effects of CGP and FCCP on steady [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations elicited by weak depolarization (see Figure 9 D of the preceding study; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Basis for the Plateau Level and Its Relationship to the Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> Set Point</title><p>Previous studies have identified the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau level with the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> set point (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ThayerandMiller1990">Thayer and Miller 1990</xref>) but the actual relationship between these two quantities has not been described. In the preceding study, the plateau level was defined as the c<sub>i</sub> level where J<sub>total</sub> reaches a minimum during the recovery. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> (D, right), J<sub>total</sub> reaches a minimum when the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is nearly maximal (and J<sub>mito</sub> is close to its minimal value). From the family of responses shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A, it is apparent that the plateau level approaches a limiting value as the stimulus raises c<sub>m</sub> to progressively higher levels, and that the rate of recovery at the plateau approaches zero. The basis for the plateau level and its limiting value is examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. C</xref>, show simulated c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> responses elicited by the same strong stimulus (A) with the initial value of c<sub>m</sub> set at the beginning of the recovery to different levels. Also shown are the time courses of J<sub>total</sub> (D), J<sub>mito</sub> (E), and J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> (F).</p><p>If the recovery begins with c<sub>m</sub> equal to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> C, trace 1), c<sub>m</sub> never reaches a very high level and the rate of net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is low during the entire recovery (E). In this case, J<sub>total</sub> does not exhibit a minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> D) so there is no c<sub>i</sub> plateau (B). With larger initial values of c<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> C, traces 2&#8211;5), J<sub>total</sub> passes through a minimum that approaches zero (D) and the c<sub>i</sub> plateaus become increasingly flat (B). Another way to visualize how the J<sub>total</sub> minimum is influenced by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load is to plot this flux against c<sub>i</sub> during each of the recoveries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> G). As shown in the inset, the magnitude of J<sub>total</sub> at the minimum approaches zero, and the value of c<sub>i</sub> where the minimum occurs approaches a limiting value. In each case, the J<sub>total</sub> minimum occurs near the c<sub>i</sub> level where J<sub>mito</sub> is minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, compare G with H) and the magnitude of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> is maximal.</p><p>The basis for the plateau and its limiting level finally becomes clear when J<sub>total</sub> for each of the five recoveries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> I, thick traces 1&#8211;5) is separated into its c<sub>i</sub>-dependent component (J<sub>pm</sub> + J<sub>uni</sub>) and the remaining (c<sub>m</sub>-dependent) component, J<sub>Na/Ca</sub>. During each recovery, (J<sub>pm</sub> + J<sub>uni</sub>) (thin trace) declines montonically with a stereotyped c<sub>i</sub> dependence. In contrast, the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release ascends to a peak during phase i of the recovery as c<sub>i</sub> falls and c<sub>m</sub> rises, and then descends as c<sub>m</sub> declines, having an initial value that depends on c<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, thin traces 1&#8211;5); the peak is sharper if the rate equation for J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> includes inhibition by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D). In terms of the model, it is the J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> peak that is responsible for the J<sub>mito</sub> and J<sub>total</sub> minima, and therefore the c<sub>i</sub> plateau. As the initial mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load increases, the release pathway nears saturation, the magnitude of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> during the initial phase of recovery approaches V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> (horizontal dotted line) and the plateau level approaches a limiting value. This is the (stable) steady state value of c<sub>i</sub> that would be reached if c<sub>m</sub> were clamped at such a high value that the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is maximal (J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> &#8764; V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub>) and c<sub>i</sub> were allowed to relax from its initial value at the end of the stimulus. In this case, J<sub>total</sub> would be described by J<sub>total</sub>* = (J<sub>pm</sub> + J<sub>uni</sub>) + V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> (dotted curve), which crosses the zero-net flux axis at the limiting plateau level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> I, up arrow). Here, the outward flux (J<sub>pm</sub> + J<sub>uni</sub>) and the inward flux V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> are in balance. Of course, if c<sub>m</sub> is free to change, the limiting plateau level is never attained because the mitochondrial pool is finite and c<sub>m</sub> and J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> ultimately decline.</p><p>Therefore, the limiting plateau level depends not only on the properties of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but also on uptake (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nicholls1985">Nicholls 1985</xref>) and on plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Increasing the release rate, either by increasing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load or raising V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub>, would shift the plateau level to higher c<sub>i</sub>, while increasing either J<sub>uni</sub> or J<sub>pm</sub> would shift it to lower values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> I). This illustrates how the effect of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics depends not only on properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release pathways but also on the cellular context in which they operate.</p></sec><sec><title>Graded Inhibition of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub>: Comparison with the Actions of CGP</title><p>It has been proposed that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau is caused by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ThayerandMiller1990">Thayer and Miller 1990</xref>). However, it was shown above that according to the model, the limiting c<sub>i</sub> plateau level is influenced by both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. To examine how the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger influences c<sub>i</sub> recovery kinetics, simulations were carried out after reducing V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> stepwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This yielded a family of c<sub>i</sub> responses whose recoveries show a similar initial rapid phase but progressively lower and longer plateaus. When V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> is large (e.g., 35 nM/s), c<sub>m</sub> declines at a rapid, nearly constant rate during the plateau phase, causing c<sub>i</sub> to hang up at an elevated level just below 300 nM until c<sub>m</sub> falls and saturation of the release pathway is relieved. When V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> is small (e.g., 3.5 nM/s), c<sub>m</sub> declines at a much slower rate, leading to a lower and more prolonged plateau that appears as a slow c<sub>i</sub> tail like that seen during recoveries in the presence of CGP at nearly saturating concentrations (see preceding study, Figure 4 A). In each case, it is as if during the plateau phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> was injected into the cytoplasm at a nearly constant rate, causing c<sub>i</sub> to be elevated to an extent that varies directly with the rate of injection. However, since the exchanger is not completely saturated and the mitochondrial pool is exhaustible, c<sub>i</sub> is not a constant during the plateau phase but instead declines. The response onset is less sensitive to changes in V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> than the recovery because J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> constitutes a smaller fraction of the total net Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux when c<sub>i</sub> is high. The simulated responses can be compared with responses elicited during treatment with CGP at subsaturating concentrations (see Figure 4 B of accompanying study).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Graded Changes in V<sub>max,uni</sub>: Comparison with the Effects of FCCP</title><p>It was shown above that disabling mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation only slightly modifies responses to weak stimuli, in agreement with the observed effects of FCCP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In that simulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation was inhibited by setting k<sub>max,uni</sub> to zero. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> illustrates how graded changes in k<sub>max,uni</sub> influence responses to strong stimuli. When uptake is completely inhibited (k<sub>max,uni</sub> = 0) c<sub>i</sub> responses resemble those seen in the presence of FCCP. As k<sub>max,uni</sub> is increased, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation proceeds at progressively higher rates so that c<sub>m</sub> rises more rapidly and reaches higher levels by the end of the stimulus. This is accompanied by a slower and smaller rise in c<sub>i</sub> during the stimulus, and a modified recovery marked by a faster phase i and a slower phase ii with lower plateau level. When k<sub>max,uni</sub> = 80 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, c<sub>i</sub> responses resemble [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses elicited by depolarization in the absence of FCCP.</p><p>The effects of increasing k<sub>max,uni</sub> can be explained as follows. The plateau level is lowered because the maximal rate of net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during the recovery is reduced owing to stronger Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at each value of c<sub>i</sub>; the lower rate of net Ca<sup>2+</sup> release also causes the recoveries to be more prolonged. Net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is slower in spite of increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads, which by themselves would tend to increase J<sub>Na/Ca</sub>. This is because the release pathway is nearly saturated, and the rate of release is low compared with uptake over this range of concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Graded Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> Extrusion Rate: Relationship between the Plateau Level and the Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> Set Point</title><p>The mitochondrial set point concept provides an elegant explanation of the ability of isolated mitochondria to maintain the extramitochondrial Ca concentration at a fixed value when the intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is high. As described previously, the basis of the set point lies in the relationship between mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release pathways: if intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is high enough that the rate of release is constant, then uptake by the uniporter will maintain the extramitochondrial steady state Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at a fixed level (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="NichollsandAkerman1982">Nicholls and Akerman 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Crompton1985">Crompton 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hansford1985">Hansford 1985</xref>). While this applies to isolated mitochondria in a closed system, it does not adequately describe mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in intact cells. It was shown above that the limiting plateau level, when the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> load is large, depends not only on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport but also on the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. Simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> illustrate how the plateau level is influenced by the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion under conditions where the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not completely saturated. As V<sub>max,extru</sub> is lowered, c<sub>i</sub> declines more slowly, which increases the activity of the uniporter and thereby lowers the rate of net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. These two factors elevate and prolong the plateau. In the limiting case where V<sub>max,extru</sub> is zero and the plasma membrane is impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the model describes the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by isolated mitochondria in a closed system; in this case, c<sub>i</sub> ultimately stabilizes at the set point.</p></sec><sec><title>Simulated Responses to Brief and Long Periodic Stimulus Trains</title><p>It was shown previously that after brief trains of stimulated action potentials that elevate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to &#8764;300 nM, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovers with a kinetically simple time course, while after longer trains that raise [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to levels approaching &#8764;500 nM, the recovery is kinetically complex, much like the recovery that follows a strong, steady depolarization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> (left) compares simulated responses to repetitive stimulus trains of short and long duration. Since the interval between stimuli is too short to permit complete recovery, c<sub>i</sub> undergoes temporal summation (see initial portion of the response to the longer stimulus train on an expanded time scale, right). As c<sub>i</sub> rises, the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation also rises (right, bottom). The properties of the recovery depend on the initial value of c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub>, which in turn depend on stimulus duration. These simulations reproduce the differential effects of brief and long trains of evoked action potentials on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in these cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Summary of Main Findings</title><p>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release pathways have been characterized in isolated mitochondria, but to our knowledge, the activity and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dependence of these transporters has not been described in intact cells. Such information is important because transport by isolated mitochondria may differ from that in situ, and because mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport occurs within a system of transporters that must be taken into consideration.</p><p>This study extends to intact cells several general conclusions that have been drawn from studies of isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="NichollsandAkerman1982">Nicholls and Akerman 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hansford1985">Hansford 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Crompton1985">Crompton 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Crompton1999">Crompton 1999</xref>). First, mitochondria are expected to accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> even in response to weak stimuli that elevate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> only slightly above resting levels. Second, there are two qualitatively different stimulus regimes. Weak stimuli raise [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to a level where the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is lower than the maximal rate of release via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger. Such stimuli would be expected to raise [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> to new steady state levels where the net Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux across the plasma membrane and the net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux are both zero. Since the steady state value of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> should not be influenced by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport, inhibitors of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (e.g., FCCP) should not affect this level; such inhibitors would, however, speed onset and recovery kinetics. This explains, at least in part, the paradoxical observation that although weak depolarizations increase total mitochondrial Ca concentration (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>) the steady [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations they cause are not very sensitive to FCCP or CCCP (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FrielandTsien1994">Friel and Tsien 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Herringtonetal1996">Herrington et al. 1996</xref>). Strong stimuli, in contrast, raise [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to levels where mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake exceeds the maximal rate of release so that a steady state is impossible. In this case, an apparent steady state can be reached where mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation balances net Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry across the plasma membrane. In this state, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is steadily elevated and mitochondria accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> continuously, as seen during maintained depolarization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>). Under these conditions of stimulation, inhibitors of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (e.g., FCCP) would shift the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> level where J<sub>total</sub> is zero to a higher level, accounting for the observation that strong depolarizations elicit larger [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations after treatment with protonophores (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ThayerandMiller1990">Thayer and Miller 1990</xref>). Interestingly, after blocking mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, weak stimuli elicit responses like those produced by strong stimuli before block, characterized by continuous mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and a depressed steady [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise that is sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake inhibitors.</p><p>Third, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau level cannot be equated with the mitochondrial set point observed in studies of isolated mitochondria, since it depends jointly on mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Only in the limiting case where the plasma membrane is an impenetrable barrier to net Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport can the plateau level be identified with the set point: in this case the model describes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in a closed system like those used in studies of isolated mitochondria.</p><p>Finally, since [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics depends on a system of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport pathways, there are multiple sites for potential modulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the processes they control. For example, the simulations indicate that properties of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> recovery are jointly regulated by the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter and plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport systems; they would also be influenced by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport if it were enabled (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Simplifications Used in the Analysis</title><p>Cells were studied under conditions that simplified the analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Thapsigargin was used to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by SERCA pumps, making it possible to study the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the plasma membrane and uptake and release by mitochondria in isolation from ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport. Analysis was restricted to the recovery after depolarization-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations, after spatial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> gradients are largely dissipated, so that the free Ca concentration within each cellular compartment is approximately uniform spatially. Extension of the analysis to include the ER will require quantitative information about its Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release pathways, while treating the initial period of stimulation, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is distributed non-uniformly, will require detailed information about the spatial distribution of mitochondria and its dynamics.</p><p>For the model simulations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was evoked by a step increase in plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. This leads to an instantaneous increase in the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry across the plasma membrane to a level that depends on both Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and the difference between internal and external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="APPAppendix"/>). During stimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability was assumed to be constant, so time-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation and inactivation were not taken into consideration. As a result, the simulated time courses of c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> during a depolarizing stimulus are not expected to follow precisely the changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> that occur in situ. Information about the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry during the stimulus should facilitate extension of the analysis to the period of depolarization.</p></sec><sec><title>Properties of Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> Uptake and Release in Intact Neurons</title><p>The equations describing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release were motivated by results from studies of isolated mitochondria, so it is logical to compare, where possible, parameters of the equations with those describing transport by the isolated organelles. For J<sub>uni</sub>, reliable estimates of k<sub>max,uni</sub> and EC<sub>50,uni</sub> were not possible given the limited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> range over which our measurements were made. However, it was possible to estimate the Hill coefficient (n<sub>uni</sub> &#8764;2) which agrees with measurements from isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ScarpaandGraziotti1973">Scarpa and Graziotti 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandPfeiffer1990">Gunter and Pfeiffer 1990</xref>). For J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> we obtained estimates of V<sub>max,Na/Ca</sub> that ranged from &#8764;35&#8211;75 nM/s. This can be compared with the maximal rate of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by isolated heart and brain mitochondria (&#8764;10 and 30 nmol/mg prot/min; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HayatandCrompton1982">Hayat and Crompton 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandGunter1994">Gunter and Gunter 1994</xref>), which convert to &#8764; 63&#8211;188 nmol/li cytosolic volume/s, values that are in reasonable agreement. The estimated value of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> at which the rate of release is half maximal (&#8764;307 nM) is smaller than values obtained from studies of isolated mitochondria: &#8764;1&#8211;10 &#956;M (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GunterandPfeiffer1990">Gunter and Pfeiffer 1990</xref>). With the estimated parameter values, the equations for J<sub>uni</sub> and J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> together provide estimates of total mitochondrial Ca transport rates that agree with measured values. For example, with k<sub>max,uni</sub> = 80 s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and EC<sub>50,uni</sub> = 10 &#956;M, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2"/> can be evaluated at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = 554 nM (the mean peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> level during steady 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> depolarization), to give J<sub>uni</sub> &#8764; 134 nM/s. This converts to a total mitochondrial Ca flux of (134)(200)/0.1 = 267 &#956;M/s; after subtracting the (maximal) rate of Ca release (35 nM/s)(200)/0.1 = 70 &#956;M/s gives a net flux (197 &#956;M/s) that is similar to the measured rate of mitochondrial total Ca accumulation during exposure to 50 mM K<sup>+</sup>, 184 &#956;M/s (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>During all but the initial rapid phase of recovery, J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> depends on &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>in way that is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WingroveandGunter1986">Wingrove and Gunter 1986</xref>). However, during the initial phase, J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> increased in a way that could not be explained simply in terms of the accompanying rise in &#916;Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>m</sub>
<sup>i</sup>,suggesting that the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release depends on other factors as well. Since previous work shows that J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> can be inhibited by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, the rate equation for J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> was modified to include an inhibitory term, after which it described J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> during the entire recovery. However, the steep [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of inhibition that was required seemed unrealistic (Hill coefficient &#8764;6). This suggests that yet other variables may contribute to the depression of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> under these conditions, for example, intramitochondrial Na concentration (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>). Therefore, the inhibitory factor should be regarded as an empirical description of the deviation of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> from the simple rate equation. In any case, since simulated c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> dynamics were not modified appreciably by this factor, the depression of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> during phase i of the recovery was not considered further.</p><p>Saturation of J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> strongly influences the way c<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>m</sub> change during and after stimulation. It sets the stage for continuous mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation when c<sub>i</sub> is high during stimulation, and it is responsible for a nearly constant rate of net Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during phase ii of the recovery, which generates the c<sub>i</sub> plateau. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release could also occur at constant rate even when the release pathway is not saturated if Ca phosphate (CaP) formation effectively clamps intramitochondrial free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at a constant level (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="NichollsandAkerman1982">Nicholls and Akerman 1982</xref>). This has been proposed to account for limited elevations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> during continuous electrical stimulation in nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="David1999">David 1999</xref>). While such complexes form reversibly under the conditions of stimulation described in this study, and appear to play an important role in intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pivovarovaetal1999">Pivovarova et al. 1999</xref>), we did not see J<sub>Na/Ca</sub> fall abruptly from a ceiling during the recovery, arguing that such a mechanism is not responsible for the complex recovery kinetics described in this and the preceding study.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> Transport during Repetitive Electrical Activity</title><p>Based on the model simulations, the effect of repetitive stimulation on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> would depend critically on stimulus frequency. If the interval between individual stimuli or bursts of stimuli is long enough to permit complete recovery, then [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> would change periodically. If the intervals are brief enough so that recovery is incomplete, both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> would be expected to undergo temporal summation, ultimately oscillating about an elevated mean that increases with frequency. This could provide a mechanism by which fluctuations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are translated into more steady elevations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>. Indeed, this has been argued for the heart (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Crompton1999">Crompton 1999</xref>). If a periodic stimulus causes average [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to exceed the level where Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the uniporter is faster than the maximal rate of release, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> will increase continuously, raising the possibility that there are distinct low and high frequency stimulus regimes analogous to the weak and strong regimes described above. Finally, slow net mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the aftermath of action potential-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry could provide a mechanism by which stimulus history influences responses to subsequent stimuli (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="TangandZucker1997">Tang and Zucker 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the American Heart Association (96011490) and from the National Institutes of Health (NS 33514-03).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>

<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD17"/> describe concentration fluxes that can be interpreted as the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> delivery by the individual transport systems (e.g., J&#771;<sub>pm</sub>) divided by the effective cytoplasmic volume (e.g., J<sub>pm</sub>=J&#771;<sub>pm</sub>v<sub>i</sub>&#954;<sub>i</sub>

<sup>T</sup>is the ratio of (infinitesimal) changes in total to free Ca concentration. This model does not explicitly include a description of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#968;) dynamics and applies to the case where &#916;&#968; is constant (see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MagnusandKeizer1997">Magnus and Keizer 1997</xref> for a description of the more general case).</p><p>To simulate the effects of membrane depolarization, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>
