They are characterized by recurrent and paroxysmal attacks without loss of consciousness, and are classified into four subgroups based on phenomenology according to the duration and frequency of attacks and precipitants. Paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a clinical subgroup of paroxysmal dyskinesias [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Familial PNKD (OMIM No. 11880), also known as dystonia type 8 (DYT8), is a major form of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by intermittent attacks that include one side, subsequently spreading to the other side, involving the limbs and face, and is triggered by caffeine, alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, and sleep deprivation, but not by sudden movement. Involuntary movements occur spontaneously and last from minutes to several hours, or even an entire day. Aura often presents with limb numbness, stiffness, or restlessness. Its onset occurs in infancy or early childhood [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1) gene mutations mapped to chromosome 2q35 in families of different ethnic origins were recently identified as causative and highly penetrant mutations in PNKD [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Case description</title><p id="p0010">A 26-year-old man who had experienced dystonic movements and choreiform right arm spreading to his arms, legs, and face visited Kurume University Hospital at the age of one. In addition, oral dyskinesias and rarely dysarthria is also sometimes observed. An aura often presents with limb weakness and stiffness. Attacks lasting approximately five minutes occurred several times per day, often while he was hugged due to becoming fussy during infancy. Treatment with clonazepam (CZP) (0.9&#8211;3&#160;mg) from the age of one decreased the frequency of attacks to two times per week, while the response to carbamazepin was poor. Clinical evaluation, including physical and neurological examinations and interviews was conducted at the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health Kurume University School of Medicine. EEG, brain MRI, and CT showed no abnormalities. At 26&#160;years of age, his score on the Self-Rating Depression Scale test (65 points; severe depression 60&#8211;80), State&#8211;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score (78 points; cut off&#160;=&#160;47.27&#160;&#177;&#160;10.45 points), and scores on the five mood domains of the Profile of Mood States&#8482;, fatigue-inertia, anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, and tension-anxiety revealed current depressed mood and anxiety. A video, recorded on a smartphone of an attack before sertraline treatment is shown in Video 1 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A<bold>, Video 1</bold>). He was forced to quit his job due to relationship difficulties and once attempted suicide, resulting in his attacks increasing to four times a week and the duration of such attacks increasing to one to two hours. He started taking escitalopram 10&#160;mg once a day as an SSRI for depression and anxiety. His mood and attacks remained unstable for one month. He switched to sertraline 25&#160;mg once daily. Fatigue accumulated due to the drastic change in his work environment after a job change, and his depression and anxiety became exacerbated. He sometimes behaved violently, and the frequency and duration of his attacks fluctuated.<fig id="f0005" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The pedigree of the Japanese family with paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and the neuroimages of the involuntary movements.</p><p>(A) Video neuroimaging of intermittent and involuntary movements. A paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia attack began with chorea of the right fingers, followed by chorea of the bilateral fingers, ballisms, cervical dystonia (torticoli), and orofacial dyskinesia. After sitting in a chair to stop the attack, dystonia occurred sequentially in his left arm. The attack lasted approximately 4&#160;min and 30&#160;s without a loss of consciousness.

In the sixth month of taking sertraline, the CZP dosage was reduced to 3&#160;mg/day, and he began to successfully self-manage his life. One year after taking sertraline, the patient's attacks decreased to 1 every 2&#160;months, and his STAI score decreased by 5&#8211;10 points on treatment with CZP and sertraline, allowing his condition to become stable enough that he was able to participate in society further and recognize that he needed to go to counselling. His parents were not consanguineous and had no neurological disorders except for PNKD. His family members inherited the c.26C&#160;&gt;&#160;T mutation of the PNKD/MR-1 gene in an autosomal dominant manner (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C).</p><p id="p0020">Rare episodic movement disorders are difficult to distinguish from other neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy and sleep disorders). He had long-lasting attacks provoked by alcohol, caffeine, or other non-kinesigenic triggers, characterized by intermittent attacks of abnormal involuntary movements without loss of consciousness. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Japanese familial PNKD with the c.26C&#160;&gt;&#160;T mutation of the MR-1 gene. Japanese middle-aged PNKD patients were treated with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for major depressive episodes [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ECT was previously reported to be effective for treating depression in patients with PNKD, but ineffective for treating PNKD attacks.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0025">The spectrum of heritable mutations in the MR-1 gene varies within movement disorders, including PNKD, migraine, and Tourette's disorder [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. MR-1 is widely expressed, especially in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is composed of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the striatum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. MR-1/PNKD is homologous to HAGH, which encodes an enzyme involved in the detoxification pathway of methylglyoxal, a compound present in coffee and alcoholic beverages, producing a byproduct of oxidative stress [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Caffeine, a ryanodine receptor agonist at presynaptic terminals, favors high concentrations of calcium in striatal neurons and enhances hyperexcitability owing to the lack of MR-1 [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the dyskinesia-on state, dopamine signals via the D1- and D2-dopamine receptors enhanced to release movements through the direct pathway and suppressed to halt movements through the indirect pathway [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CZP enhances GABA fast inhibition in the basal ganglia via GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the major inhibitory and metabotropic receptors, is long-acting and high-potency benzodiazepine used for epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia, and it also has serotonergic activity by increasing serotonin synthesis. Sertraline is considered a safe and relatively well-tolerated medication for the treatment of depression and social phobia. Extrapyramidal symptoms, including dyskinesia, may occur as adverse effects of SSRIs. Increased serotonin availability has been proposed to indirectly inhibit dopamine release in the striatum by increasing 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, administration of sertraline increases extracellular dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens and striatum [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Sertraline also does not affect the pharmacokinetics of CZP [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This suggests that sertraline may be potent against PNKD attacks comorbid with anxiety and depression. Drug therapy with CZP and sertraline is therefore the preferred treatment for reducing attacks in PNKD patients with strong anxiety and depression.</p><p id="p0030">The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary video 1</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="mmc1.mp4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><alt-text>Supplementary video 1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material></p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0040">M.H. and T.M. performed the follow-ups and evaluated the patients.
