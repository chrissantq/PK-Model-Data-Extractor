Aristolochic acid I (AAI), an important ingredient, has been associated with tumorigenesis. Recently, some studies indicated that AAI could induce liver injury in mice of different age, but comprehensive mechanisms of AAI-induced differences in liver injury in various age groups have not yet been elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the causal relationship between AAI-induced liver injury and age based on neonatal mice and adult mice. A survival experiment indicated that all neonatal mice survived. Moreover, the adult mice in the high-dose AAI group all died, whereas half of the adult mice in the low-dose AAI group died. In observation experiments, AAI induced more severe liver injury in neonatal mice than adult mice under long-term than short-term exposure. Furthermore, integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics indicated that AAI disturbing steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, the drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolism induced neonatal mice liver injury. The important role of age in AAI-induced liver injury was illustrated in our study. This study also lays a solid foundation for scientific supervision of AA safety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aristolochic acid I</kwd><kwd>liver injury</kwd><kwd>neonatal</kwd><kwd>adult</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aristolochic acid (AA) is derived from certain plants, such as the genera Aristolochia and Asarum, which have been widely used as herbal remedies in traditional Chinese medicine (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). However, AA has been discovered to be one of the most potent nephrotoxic human carcinogen, and it has been listed as a category-I carcinogen by the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nault and Letouz&#233;, 2019</xref>). Some studies have demonstrated that AA are metabolized into aristolochic acid lactam nitrogen ions with a strong electrophilic ability <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, allowing them to electrophilically combine with amino groups outside the DNA base ring to generate corresponding deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine adducts, to induce A-T transversion mutation of the gene product and form biomarkers related to the carcinogenic and mutagenic activity of aristolochic acids (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dra&#269;&#237;nsk&#225; et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arlt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Stiborov&#225; et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, the correlation between AA and liver cancer has attracted widespread attention. One study indicated that AA can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to its genetic toxicity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Poon et al., 2013</xref>). An epidemiological study showed that there is a dose&#8211;response relationship between AA exposure and the development of HCC in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chi-Jen Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In a recent study, an AA-induced mutational signature (A-T transversion mutation) was found in 78% of 98 liver cancer patients in Taiwan (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In fact, AA can be divided into aristolochic acids I, II, III and IV, of which aristolochic acid I (AAI, C17H11NO7) is the main toxic component (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, in these early studies, AAI were demonstrated to inhibit carcinogenesis in carcinogen-induced animal models (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Filitis and Massagetov, 1961</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kupchan and Doskotch, 1962</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1964</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kupchan and Wormser, 1965</xref>). Herb containing AAI have been used for centuries to treat various human diseases (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dawson, 1927</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Scarborough, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Grollman and Marcus, 2016</xref>). In recent times, some scholars pointed out that AAI can induce the development of HCC. One study verified that canines had precancerous lesions in the liver after 10&#160;days of oral administration of AAI (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Another study indicated that exposure to short-term AAI <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> only showed a potential liver cancer-causing effect (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Rossiello et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). A recent paper demonstrated that AAI promoted clonal expansion but did not induce hepatocellular carcinoma in the liver of adult rats (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, liver tumors could be observed in neonatal mice after 9&#160;months of AAI intake (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Those studies have shown that AAI may be a risk factor for liver injury. However, current experimental or clinical studies on liver injury induced by AAI took no account of age, administration times, and treatment course (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chin-Nu Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we considered the age stage at which AAI was used. Adult mice and neonatal mice mimicked adult and children, respectively. The treatment course is another important factor. Five days after the administration of AAI, short-term and long-term observation experiments were conducted to assess whether AAI could induce liver injury. Moreover, given that transcriptomics and metabolomics are &#8216;omics&#8217; approaches widely employed to improve comprehension of the chemical mechanism of toxicity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>), we combined metabolomics and genomics to explore the underlying mechanism of AAI-induced liver injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemical and Animal Treatment</title><p>Aristolochic acid I (CAS No. 313-67-7, &#8805;98.9%, MedChemexpress CO., Ltd, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in 4% dimethyl sulfoxide and 4% Tween-80 in 0.9% NaCl. The AAI exposure dose for neonatal rats were divided into low dose (2.5&#160;mg/kg) and high dose (5&#160;mg/kg). The low and high administration doses of adult mice were 2.2&#160;mg/kg and 4.4&#160;mg/kg, respectively.</p><p>All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the animal ethics committee of the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (IACUC No. 2021-0010). During the observation weeks, all mice were permitted water and food freely and held under a 12&#160;h dark/light cycle at 22 &#177; 2&#176;C. First, a survival study was designed to estimate toxicity in neonatal mice and adult mice. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (adult mice) and 2&#160;week-old male C57BL/6 mice (neonatal mice) were purchased from SPF Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). C57/6 neonatal mice and adult mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10), low-dose group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) and high-dose group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10), all of which were fasted for 12&#160;h before the experiment started. From Monday to Friday, the control, low-dose and high-dose groups were intraperitoneally injected with 0, 2.5 and 5.0&#160;mg/kg/day AAI in the neonatal mice group, and with 0, 2.2 and 4.4&#160;mg/kg/day AAI in the adult mice group. The survival status, number of sacrifices and time of sacrifice were all recorded. In the second study, 24 adult/neonatal mice were randomly divided according to the same standard as the previous three groups, with eight in each group, and the administration followed the same survival study protocol. Compared to the survival study, the exposure was shortened to 8&#160;h after drug withdrawal (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In the third study, 24 neonatal mice were randomly divided according to the same standard as the previous three groups, with eight in each group; according to the survival study, 40 adult mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8), low-dose group (n = 16) and high-dose group (n = 16). The administration followed the second study protocol, and the exposure was prolonged to 52 weeks after drug withdrawal (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>AAI induced indistinct liver injury in neonatal mice compared to adult mice based on a short-term observation study. <bold>(A)</bold> Survival curve of the animals subjected to AAI. <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic diagram of the study design.

When adult mice were administered a high dose of AAI, they were died beginning on the first day after AAI administration for five consecutive days, and the mortality rate was 100% on the 11th day due to acute tubular necrosis. During this experiment, most adult mice expressed slow movements, listlessness and poor appetite symptoms before they were died; in contrast, all neonatal mice survived. This result suggested that when AAI was administrated at equivalent dose to neonatal and adult mice, the degree of damage of AAI to adult mice was significantly higher than that to neonatal mice. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> showed that no abnormality was observed in the livers of neonatal mice, but AAI exposure to adult mice induced mild inflammation. In addition, ALT, AST and TBIL were tested to further demonstrate the degree of liver injury, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D&#8211;F</xref> illustrated that ALT and AST were significantly increased in the AAI-treated adult group. Blood chemistry showed that AAI was prone to cause acute liver damage in adult mice in a short-term exposure, but had no obvious toxic effect on the corresponding organs of neonatal mice treated with equivalent dose. These results showed that AAI could result in slight liver injury to adult mice in the short term. Moreover, no visible injury was found in the stomach of these adult and neonatal mice, although acute renal tubular necrosis was observed both in low and high dosage of AAI-exposed adult mice (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AAI Induces Serious Liver Injury in Neonatal Mice Compared to Adult Mice Based on Long-Term Observation</title><p>In this study, we also conducted an observational experiment for 52&#160;weeks. During the observation, all of the neonatal mice survived, whereas the AAI high-dose group of the adult mice were all died, and eight adult mice (8/16) were sacrificed in the AAI low-dose group, consistent with the survival experiment. In particular, hepatic cysts were observed in AAI-treated neonatal mice, three neonatal mice had hepatic cysts in the liver in the low-dose group, and four neonatal mice had hepatic cysts in the liver in the high-dose group (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, there were no abnormalities in any of the adult mice groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The histopathology showed that (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) the low-dose group and the high-dose group of neonatal mice exhibited hydropic degeneration or spotty necrosis. Moreover, there was only a small amount of pyknosis and nucleolysis of liver nuclei in the low-dose group of adult mice. Therefore, the degree of injuries of the neonatal mice with equivalent dose was more obvious than that of the adult mice. These results showed that AAI could result in liver injury in neonatal mice after a long-term exposure. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C&#8211;E</xref> showed that long-term exposed to AAI in neonatal and adult mice had minimal impact on the activity of AST and ALT or the concentration of TBIL.

In recent decades, it has been confirmed that AA can induce renal toxicity and cause aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Schmeiser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anger et al., 2020</xref>). Since 2017, AA has also induced HCC in Chinese and Southeast Asian populations based on clinical data analysis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2017</xref>). Some studies have shown that AAI, the most dominant component of AA, could induce liver injury in adult rodent animals (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nault and Letouz&#233;, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, a previous study indicated that AAI could induce liver cancer in neonatal mice through a rodent model of 2&#160;week-old mice for safety evaluation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). However, most experimental studies based on the relationship between AAs and HCC did not consider pediatric patients (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chi-Jen Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Herbal medicines containing AA are also commonly used to treat cough, fever and diarrhea in children (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the study of an adult mice model alone cannot fully illuminate the problem of liver injury caused by AAI. Based on a prophase investigation, age was fully considered in this study, and we constructed neonatal and adult liver injury mice model to comprehensively evaluate the objectivity of liver injury induced by AAI.</p><p>The short-term effects of AAI exposed on neonatal and adult mice were investigated. The results showed that at equivalent doses, acute liver injury in adult mice in the short term after AAI administration was more obvious than that in neonatal mice. AST and ALT remarkably increased in adult mice after 5&#160;days of administration, but not in neonatal mice. There was no acute liver injury in neonatal mice within a short time after administration, which might be related to the lower activity of metabolic enzymes in neonatal mice than in adult mice (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, we performed long-term (52&#160;weeks) observations to assess the degree of AAI-induced liver injury. AAI resulted in liver cysts in the neonatal group, and all AAI-treated adult mice were died successively after high-dose administration for 5&#160;days, at the same time 50% of mice were died in the low-dose group of adult mice during the observation period. Some literatures also indicated that AAI could induce adult mice sacrifice through acute renal tubular injury (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the surviving adult mice might progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) after a recovery period due to maladaptive repair or other underlying mechanisms (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ogbadu et al., 2019</xref>). We measured AST, ALT and TBIL to evaluate the degree of liver injury, but there was no significant change in either neonatal or adult mice.

The metabolic activity of the compound needs to be biotransformed by the phase I enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP450), and then the phase II enzyme combines with GST (glutathione-s-transferase) to catalyze the detoxification reaction and excretion (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Stiborov&#225; et al., 2014</xref>). A number of studies on the metabolic mechanism of AAI have elucidated that the CYP450 enzyme plays an important role in the process of detoxification (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Stiborov&#225; et al., 2015</xref>). CYP1A2 is a critical hepatic member of the CYP450 family. The process by which AAI is demethylated by CYP1A1/2 to produce AAIa is considered to be the detoxification process of AAI (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). However, AAI-treated adult mice did not exhibit inhibited activity of liver microsomal CYP1A2. Additionally, glutathione has been shown to play a critical role in detoxification processes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Stiborov&#225; et al., 2017</xref>). AAI inhibited GSH conversion into pyroglutamic acid (by -2.0679-fold) by interfering with the expression of GPX (by -3.8496-fold), and reduced the oxidation of GSH by downregulation GGCT (by -1.6934-fold). In summary, the level of GSH was increased in this pathway, which played a crucial protective role against injury when adult mice were exposed to AAI.</p><p>During long-term exposure, liver injury generated in AAI-neonatal mice was due to the drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. In the drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 pathway, the downregulation of CYP1A2 (by 1.0713-fold) among AAI-treated neonatal mice inhibited the detoxification of AAI, leading to its accumulation in the body and causing liver damage. Then, in the AAI-treated neonatal mice, AAI disturbed the phospholipid metabolic process and promoted arachidonic acid metabolism to release inflammatory factors. A previous study revealed that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is responsible for catalyzing phosphatidylcholine transfer to hemolytic lecithin, accompanied by the release of arachidonic acid and fatty acids (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). In the metabolic pathway, phosphatidylcholine was converted into LysoPC (22:4 (7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z)/0:0) (by 1.9735-fold) and arachidonic acid to generate leukotriene D4 (LD4) (by 3.4274-fold). The increased LD4 might activate inflammation to promote liver damage in the AAI-treated neonatal group (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Nanji et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway was more important in liver injury in AAI-treated neonatal mice. Some studies have described that the regulation of estrogen plays a protective role in elements of HCC (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Villa, 2008</xref>). An epidemiological study indicated that men and menopausal women were more sensitive than women to induction of liver cancer, which was related to the lack of estrogen (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2014</xref>). In the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway among in AAI-treated neonatal mice, The upregulated expression of the UGT enhanced estradiol metabolism and increased the excretion level of 17-beta-estradiol-3-glucuronide (by 2.0166-fold); AAI also inhibited the expression of the HSD3 gene to decrease the level of estrone (by -3.1339-fold), the transformation material of estradiol. Therefore, we inferred that estradiol may exhibit no protective effects on liver injury in AAI-treated mice by reducing its the formation. These results supported the role of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway as a potentially critical biological process that may be connected with the development of liver cysts among AAI-treated neonatal mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies showed that when exposed to equivalent doses of AAI, adult mice and neonatal mice could suffer different degrees of liver injury during different exposure times. Acute liver injury was generated in adult mice compared with neonatal mice based on short-term observation. We performed multiomics analysis to elucidate the mechanism. AAI-induced liver injury in neonatal mice may be mainly related to steroid hormone biosynthesis, whereas glutathione may protect adult mice from liver injury during the long-term withdrawal period in the glutathione metabolism pathway. In our study, age and medication time were comprehensively considered to evaluate the degree of liver injury, which is more consistent with clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
