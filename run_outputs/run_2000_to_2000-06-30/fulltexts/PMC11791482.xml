OBI-992 is an antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) derived from a novel TROP2-targeted antibody linked to the topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor exatecan via an enzyme-cleavable hydrophilic linker, with a drug&#8211;antibody ratio of 4. This study evaluated and compared the antitumor activity of OBI-992 with that of benchmark TROP2-targeted ADCs datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in cell line&#8211;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. OBI-992 treatment exhibited statistically significant antitumor activity versus controls at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg in various CDX and PDX models, demonstrating comparable or better antitumor activity with benchmark ADCs. In a large-tumor model, longer survival times were observed in OBI-992-treated mice compared with Dato-DXd-treated mice. OBI-992 treatment induced marked bystander killing of TROP2-negative cells in the presence of nearby TROP2-positive cells in both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies. In lung adenocarcinoma CDX models with overexpression of either P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) to mimic ATP-binding cassette transporter&#8211;mediated multidrug resistance, OBI-992 treatment maintained antitumor activity when Dato-DXd treatment became less effective. The combination of OBI-992 at suboptimal doses with either poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors or an immune check point inhibitor produced synergistic antitumor effects in mouse models. Taken together, these translational results support further development of OBI-992 as a cancer therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p>

This approach improves the therapeutic index of anticancer therapies and has been under intense research in recent years, with dozens of combinations of antibodies targeting various antigens and anticancer payloads leveraged in preclinical and clinical studies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). One target for anticancer drug delivery is trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in various tumor types relative to normal tissues (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). TROP2 is involved in stem cell biology, and its upregulation in tumor cells promotes the activation of downstream signaling networks that enhance cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Overexpression of TROP2 correlates with poor prognosis of several cancers, including oral, pancreatic, gastric, gallbladder, and breast (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors have long been investigated as cytotoxic agents. Exatecan is a potent TOP1 inhibitor that does not require metabolic activation and is a poor substrate for multidrug resistance ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), such as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Exatecan has been studied as a single agent in several clinical trials for its safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in cancer treatment (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and has been identified as a promising ADC payload (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The ADC pairing of a TROP2-targeted antibody with a TOP1 inhibitor has demonstrated success as a cancer therapy, with sacituzumab govitecan (SG) as the first approved TROP2-targeted ADC with the TOP1 inhibitor SN-38 as the payload (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, SG has a short half-life due to its unstable linker and requires frequent dosing on days 1 and 8 per 21-day treatment cycle (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, SN-38 undergoes glucuronide-mediated metabolism that can cause severe diarrhea or an increased risk for neutropenia (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2-targeted ADC with improved pharmacokinetics and less frequent dosing (once every 21-day cycle) than SG. Trastuzumab deruxtecan and Dato-DXd use the same DXd-ADC linker/payload platform, and both ADCs have been linked to interstitial lung disease (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, a stable linker may improve the ADC&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and lowers off-target toxicities, but it may also increase on-target toxicities if the target antigen is also expressed in normal tissues.</p><p>OBI-992 is an ADC derived from a novel anti-TROP2 antibody, which binds to a region distinct from that of sacituzumab and datopotamab, linked with exatecan via a hydrophilic enzyme-cleavable linker at a DAR of 4. The hydrophilic linker includes a protease-sensitive peptide (MCCa-PEG24-VA-PAB-exatecan) that is covalently bonded to cysteine residues of the antibody (T.L. Chang and colleagues; submitted for publication). <italic toggle="yes">Ex vivo</italic> serum stability and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that OBI-992 has a more stable linker and lower toxicity than Dato-DXd, warranting further investigation of OBI-992 activity <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of OBI-992 in cancer cell line&#8211;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of various types of solid tumors in comparison with SG and Dato-DXd. Additionally, we assessed the bystander killing effect of OBI-992 and OBI-992 antitumor activity in a model with overexpression of ABC transporters, a common mechanism of ADC resistance. Finally, we evaluated the synergistic antitumor effects of combined OBI-992 with established cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Refer to Supplementary Methods for details on the characterization of OBI-992, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), and immunogenic cell death (ICD) assays.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>SG was purchased from Gilead Sciences.

Briefly, the anti-TROP2 antibody R4702 and human IgG1 isotype control (BE0297, BioXcell) in conjugation buffer (50 mmol/L histidine, 20 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.0) were treated with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride for 2 to 6 hours to reduce the disulfide bond of the antibodies. The reduced antibodies were incubated with molecules containing maleimide-PEG24-VA-PAB-exatecan for 1 hour to complete the conjugation. Next, the conjugation buffer was replaced by storage buffer [20 mmol/L sodium acetate, pH 5.0 with 0.1% (w/w) polysorbate 80] via ultrafiltration/diafiltration to create final ADC OBI-992 and control ADC solutions. Drug load distribution (DLD) of the ADC was determined by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and drug&#8211;antibody ratio (DAR) was measured and calculated by reduced reversed-phased HPLC-UV (RPLC-UV). The calculation of average DAR is described in Supplementary Methods. The average DAR value was 3.9 for OBI-992 and 5.1 for the control ADC. The amino acid sequences of the anti-TROP2 antibody, R4702, are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B.

The signal intensities of cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Positive cells were gated based on the cells stained with antihuman IgG Fc-FITC. For quantitative flow cytometry, cells were stained with AF488-conjugated mouse antihuman TROP2 antibody (clone 77220, R&amp;D Systems) or an isotype control antibody. The number of binding sites of the antihuman TROP2 antibody on cells was calculated using Quantum Simply Cellular anti-Mouse IgG Kit (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. In brief, the Quantum Simply Cellular calibration microspheres were coated with increasing amounts of capture antibody, which was the same antibody used to label cells.

Tissue microarrays included 32 organ types, with samples from three different individuals per organ type. Up to 448 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human late-stage tumor tissue samples, representing 19 cancer types [bladder cancer, cervical adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gallbladder cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma, NSCLC SCC, ovarian adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)], were purchased from AMS Biotechnology. IHC staining of TROP2 was performed on Autostainer Dako Link48 and PT Link module (Dako), using rabbit antihuman TROP2 monoclonal antibody (SP294, Abcam) according to an in-house protocol. Briefly, the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and pretreated with EnVision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution High pH (K8004, Dako) at 97&#176;C for 30 minutes. Slides were then transferred to an Autostainer Dako Link to block endogenous peroxidase for 5 minutes followed by incubation with an anti-TROP2 antibody or an isotype control antibody rabbit IgG (EPR25A, Abcam) for 1 hour. Slides were developed with the EnVision FLEX High pH kit (K8002, Dako). Lastly, the sections were counterstained with EnVision FLEX Hematoxylin (K8008, Dako) for 5 minutes and then mounted.</p><p>The IHC staining results of TROP2 expression were evaluated by a certified pathologist. The H-score system (range from 0 to 300; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was used to evaluate the cytosolic/membranous expression of TROP2 and was calculated using the following formula: (percentage of cells with weak staining intensity &#215; 1) + (percentage of cells with moderate staining intensity &#215; 2) + (percentage of cells with strong staining intensity &#215; 3).

Although not reaching statistical significance, OBI-992 exhibited slightly better bystander killing effect than Dato-DXd as measured by GFP intensity.

We first analyzed the permeability and efflux ratio of several payloads, including exatecan (OBI-992 payload), DXd (Dato-DXd payload), and SN-38 (SG payload). Digoxin and estrone 3-sulfate are known substrates of P-gp and BCRP (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), respectively, and served as controls. The measured efflux ratios indicated that SN-38 and DXd were rapidly pumped out by transporters (efflux ratio &gt;9), whereas exatecan was externalized at a much lower rate (efflux ratio &lt;3; Supplementary Table S5). When measurements were made in the presence of P-gp or BCRP inhibitors (verapamil or Ko143, respectively), all efflux ratios were reduced, indicating that P-gp and BCRP were involved in the observed payload efflux (Supplementary Table S5).</p><p>The cytotoxicity of SN-38, DXd, exatecan, and the corresponding ADCs was assessed using HCC827 cell lines with stable overexpression of either P-gp (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">ABCB1</italic>) or BCRP (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">ABCG2</italic>) to mimic multidrug-resistant cancer cells (Supplementary Table S6).

The impact of P-gp and BCRP overexpression on the cytotoxicity of ADCs was similar to that observed for the corresponding payload each ADC employs (Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of SG and Dato-DXd in cells overexpressing BCRP was restored by the BCRP inhibitor Ko143, whereas in cells overexpressing P-gp, the P-gp inhibitor verapamil restored the cytotoxicity of Dato-DXd but did not notably affect the cytotoxicity of SG, as SN-38 is not a substrate of P-gp (Supplementary Table S7).

Although some ADC therapies have already shown clinical success, there is a need for further optimization of their clinical utility, which can be modulated by the combination of antibody, linker, and payload (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additional avenues of improvement for next-generation ADCs include limiting systemic toxicity and treatment resistance, as well as demonstrating efficacious combination therapy.</p><p>OBI-992&#8217;s potent antitumor activity was demonstrated and compared with benchmark ADCs in both CDX and PDX models, with the PDX results supporting its potential translatability to the clinic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Considering the difference in linker/payload design, SG was administered twice a week at a high dose while OBI-992 and Dato-DXd were given as a single injection at lower doses. TGI by OBI-992 was consistently greater than that of SG, the only FDA-approved anti-TROP2 ADC, and was greater than or comparable to the antitumor activity of Dato-DXd. However, given the higher cytotoxicity of exatecan relative to SN-38 and DXd, it may limit OBI-992 dose that can be employed in clinical settings.</p><p>Notably, antitumor activity was achieved despite the slower and lower level of internalization of OBI-992 compared with Dato-DXd and SG (T.L. Chang and colleagues; submitted for publication). The slow internalization of ADCs may enhance tissue penetration and increase tumor response, as the rapid internalization has been shown to limit ADC distribution in tumors (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Several other factors may also contribute to the antitumor activity of ADCs, such as stability during circulation, payload potency, and hydrophilicity of both the linker and the payload. Exatecan as a payload may explain OBI-992&#8217;s substantial bystander killing effect observed for mixtures of TROP2-postive and TROP2-negative cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), as exatecan has favorable membrane permeability (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Other potential benefits of OBI-992 include higher stability in circulation than Dato-DXd, as shown by <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> serum stability, which may mitigate off-target toxicities (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, the stable linker with a potent payload exatecan could also increase OBI-992&#8217;s on-target toxicities, which may compromise clinical tolerability and require attentions in clinical study.</p><p>ADC payloads, similar to traditional chemotherapy, can be susceptible to the multidrug resistance mechanism that occurs through enhanced drug extrusion by ABC transporter proteins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Two ABC transporters, P-gp and BCRP, are commonly overexpressed in treatment-resistant cancers (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Transporter-mediated treatment resistance to OBI-992 could potentially be mitigated by the payload exatecan, which, as a free drug, has low sensitivity to P-gp/BCRP overexpression. In the present study, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors and overexpression cell lines were used to assess the potential resistance to OBI-992, SG, and Dato-DXd. In measurements of free payload transport across the plasma membrane, the efflux ratio of exatecan was the lowest overall, independent of P-gp activity, and least sensitive to BCRP activity (Supplementary Table S5). These results suggest that exatecan is not a substrate of P-gp and a much weaker substrate of BCRP. The cytotoxicity and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> xenograft results showed similar trends, as OBI-992 activity was relatively consistent, whereas the activity of SG and Dato-DXd was highly affected by the overexpression of BCRP and/or P-gp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>; Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). These results suggest that OBI-992, compared with similar ADCs, may be less sensitive to multidrug resistance.</p><p>Several combination therapies have been proposed for TOP1 inhibitor-conjugated ADCs (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This study evaluated the combinations of OBI-992 with PARP inhibitors and with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The rationale for the combination with PARP inhibitors is that cancer cells have several pathways to repair the DNA damage caused by exatecan, including PARP-mediated responses and homologous recombination (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Cells deficient in homologous recombination (HRD positive) are dependent on PARP-mediated DNA repair and are thus sensitized to PARP inhibition. In this study, the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of OBI-992 plus PARP inhibitors (olaparib or talazoparib) was dependent on HRD, and this drug combination produced a significant synergistic antitumor activity in an HRD-positive xenograft model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A&#8211;D</xref>). Therefore, PARP inhibition, particularly in HRD-positive tumors, may promote the exatecan-induced accumulation of DNA damage that leads to cell death. To reduce potential toxicity of OBI-992/PARP inhibitor combination, dose titration and dose regimen (concurrent vs. sequential dosing) should be further investigated.</p><p>The rationale for combining OBI-992 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is that drug-induced ICD has the potential to activate the immune system to attack tumor cells; however, cells downregulate the immune response by expressing programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand of PD-1 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown that TOP1 inhibition increases PD-L1 expression, suggesting a downregulation of the adaptive immune response by TOP1-targeted treatment alone (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This downregulation could potentially be blocked via an anti-PD-1 therapy, which promotes antitumor immunity by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this study, both exatecan and OBI-992 treatment led to an increase in ICD markers (Supplementary Fig. S4). Additionally, significant TGI was observed with the combination treatment of OBI-992 and anti-PD-1 antibody in a murine colon cancer model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that OBI-992 treatment may induce an immune response that is promoted by PD-1 blockade, leading to enhanced tumor-directed immunity with combination therapy.</p><p>Anti-TROP2 antibodies have received FDA approval for certain breast cancers (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and are currently under clinical investigation for NSCLC (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The IHC results in the present study demonstrated high TROP2 expression in these and additional tumor types, including gynecologic, esophageal, and prostate cancers. Additionally, expression levels were higher in cancerous than in normal tissues in all tissue types except the kidney, which aligns with previous reports (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Widespread TROP2 expression, together with remarkably consistent OBI-992 antitumor activity across many cancer models, suggests that several of the cancers examined in this study are potential targets for OBI-992 therapy.</p><p>In summary, OBI-992 is a clinically relevant ADC that consistently exhibited equal or better antitumor activity than other TROP2-targeted ADCs. A strong bystander effect enabled activity against tumors with heterogeneous TROP2 expression. Moreover, OBI-992 maintained antitumor activity with the overexpression of P-gp or BCRP and showed synergistic activity in combination with PARP and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
