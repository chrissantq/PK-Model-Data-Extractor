Although this therapy has a significant therapeutic effect, severe adverse effects occur frequently. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may help to prevent adverse effects. A useful assay that can quantitate plasma levels of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur simultaneously for TDM has been desired, but such a method is not currently available. In this study, we aimed to develop a sensitive method for simultaneous quantification of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur in human plasma using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). After preparing plasma samples by protein precipitation and liquid extraction, 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS in negative electrospray ionization mode. Validation was performed according to US Food and Drugs Administration guidance. The calibration curves were linear over concentration ranges of 2&#8211;500&#160;ng/mL for 5-FU, 20&#8211;5000&#160;ng/mL for uracil, and 200&#8211;50,000&#160;ng/mL for tegafur. The corresponding average recovery rates were 79.9, 80.9, and 87.8%. The method provides accuracy within 11.6% and precision below 13.3% for all three analytes. Matrix effects of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur were higher than 43.5, 84.9, and 100.2%, respectively. This assay was successfully applied to assess the time courses of plasma 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur concentrations in two patients with colorectal liver metastasis who received&#160;UFT/LV therapy after hepatectomy. In conclusion, we succeeded to develop a sensitive and robust UPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur in human plasma. This method is potentially useful for TDM in patients receiving UFT/LV combination therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bioanalytical chemistry</kwd><kwd>Mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>Colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Liver cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H00367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Shiraiwa</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer death in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Surgical excision is the gold standard treatment, and the prognosis of CRC has improved even in patients with locally advanced lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the 5-year relative survival in patients with distant metastases or stage IV CRC remains only slightly higher than 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The liver is the most common metastatic site of CRC, and hepatectomy is considered the most effective treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), with reported 5-year post-hepatectomy survival rates of 35&#8211;58%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, hepatectomy alone does not necessarily lead to a complete cure, and the recurrence rate after hepatectomy is approximately 70%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To reduce the recurrence, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable CRLM is clinically essential. Nevertheless, there is a clinical obstacle to overcome: patients who receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy tend to develop adverse events. Severe adverse drug reaction is most likely due to impaired drug metabolism after hepatectomy.</p><p id="Par3">Combination therapy of tegafur/uracil (UFT) and leucovorin (LV) is currently considered a tolerable and safe adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for CRLM after hepatectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. UFT contains tegafur and uracil in a 1:4 molar ratio. Tegafur is a prodrug that is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the liver, and uracil and LV enhance the activity of 5-FU based on biochemical modulation. Although this regimen has excellent efficacy, severe adverse effects frequently appear, including myelosuppression, fulminant hepatitis, and diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, the incidence and grade of these adverse effects are expected to be higher in patients after hepatectomy. Thus, preventing these adverse effects is important clinically.</p><p id="Par4">Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a useful method that aims to maximize therapeutic effects and minimize the adverse effects of drugs. Among anticancer drugs, methotrexate has been measured in clinical practice for a long time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, many anticancer drugs including UFT are now available to treat patients with cancers. Reports on the development of quantification methods of anticancer drugs for TDM have been published in recent decades. Several methods for UFT and 5-FU measurements have been reported, but there are problems in terms of run time, complicated procedure, specificity, and sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) allows sensitive and selective quantification of drugs or endogenous biomarkers in biological matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. UPLC provides higher efficiency with wider ranges of linear velocity, flow rate, and backpressure. Higher backpressure and increased throughput result in superior resolution and sensitivity. UPLC reduces time and cost per sample, thereby improving productivity. In this study, we developed a specific and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS assay for simultaneous quantification of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur in human plasma. To our knowledge, there is no report to date which describes a method of simultaneous determination of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur concentrations in human plasma.

Selectivity was evaluated by comparing chromatograms of blank plasma samples obtained from six healthy volunteers without the addition of the internal standard mixture. The baseline signals at the expected analyte retention times were evaluated for interfering peaks. The recovery rate from plasma was determined by comparing the peak areas obtained from QC samples A, B or C with the respective peak area obtained from blank plasma spiked at the corresponding QC level after extraction (representing 100% of the analyte amount in an identical matrix) in triplicate determination. The potential matrix effect of plasma components affecting the measurement of analytes was calculated by comparing the peak area of blank plasma spiked at QC levels A, B or C after extraction with the respective peak area of matrix-free LC eluent containing the same amount of analyte in triplicate determination.

Within-batch precision at LLOQ varied between 9.32 and 15.18% for 5-FU, between 11.80 and 15.63% for uracil, and between 3.40 and 10.80% for tegafur. Batch-to-batch accuracy for 3 QCs was between 3.65 and 4.80% for 5-FU, between &#8722; 1.37 and 0.82% for uracil, and between 0.48 and 3.07% for tegafur. Batch-to-batch precision for 3 QCs was less than 9.27% for 5-FU, less than 8.85% for uracil, and less than 9.72% for tegafur. The extraction recovery rate and matrix effect were evaluated by triplicate determination of 3 QCs for each compound.

However, this method cannot be used to measure uracil together with 5-FU and tegafur simultaneously. Uracil inhibits the degradation of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in a competitive manner. High uracil levels are associated with higher toxicity as well as efficacy. To maintain an optimal balance between effectiveness and toxicity, tegafur and uracil are combined in a molar ratio of 1:4 in the preparation of UFT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Besides, it is known that hepatectomy causes a reduction in DPD activity, leading to elevation of not only plasma 5-FU but also uracil level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

For these reasons, we developed a novel method to quantify 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur simultaneously in this study.</p><p id="Par19">We used a combination of protein precipitation and liquid extraction for sample preparation. Indeed, protein precipitation is a speedy and straightforward method for sample preparation. However, protein precipitation alone is insufficient to remove matrices that interfere with ionization. Moreover, considering routine use of the MS system, using a combination of sample preparation procedures significantly reduces the wear of the MS system. A combination of protein precipitation and liquid extraction is expected to improve the recovery rate and reduce the matrix effect. Furthermore, simultaneous and more selective detection of 5-FU and uracil was achieved by using tandem mass spectrometry instead of a UV detector system. However, in order to quantify 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur simultaneously, the conditions for sample preparation, MS system, and LC system in our method were set in favor of tegafur. As a result, the recovery rates of the highly polar compounds; 5-FU and uracil, were lower than that of tegafur. In a previously reported combined LC-UV and LC&#8211;MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of 5-FU and tegafur, the calibration range of 5-FU was 8&#8211;200&#160;ng/mL, and that of tegafur was 800&#8211;20,000&#160;ng/mL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Despite using conditions favorable for measuring tegafur, our method has a more extensive calibration range and superior LLOQ for 5-FU compared to the previous method.</p><p id="Par20">Severe adverse effects tend to occur during adjuvant chemotherapy given after liver resection compared to without liver resection. We previously reported that major hepatectomy enhanced the toxicity of 5-FU in a rat model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The changes in drug metabolism after hepatectomy observed in the rat model probably also apply to humans. UFT/LV combination therapy is considered more tolerable and safer than oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based regimen. Although we consider UFT/LV the most recommended regimen for CRLM patients after hepatectomy, the impact of hepatectomy on the pharmacokinetics of UFT/LV remains unclear. Therefore, the optimal dose of UFT in this regimen cannot be determined. To provide more reliable therapy, TDM is a useful approach.</p><p id="Par21">After our novel method was developed and validated, we examined the clinical application of this method to TDM for patients receiving UFT/LV therapy. Although several data points of each compound at day 1 were lower than LLOQ, all data points at day 8, when steady state was assumed to have reached, were within the calibration ranges. These results demonstrate that the method is clinically applicable for TDM of patients undergoing UFT/LV therapy.</p><p id="Par22">Currently, the department of gastroenterological and pediatric surgery and the department of clinical pharmacy in Oita University Hospital are jointly conducting phase I clinical study (UMIN 000,021,146) designed to elucidate the effect of major hepatectomy, as reflected by the efficacy and toxicity of UFT/LV combination therapy. In the future, we shall evaluate the impact of major hepatectomy on drug metabolism in patients on UFT/LV combination therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">We have succeeded to develop a method for simultaneous quantification of 5-FU, uracil, and tegafur using UPLC-MS/MS. Subsequently, we verified the clinical application of this method. Our novel method is potentially useful for TDM in CRLM patients receiving UFT/LV therapy after hepatectomy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Encouragement of Young Scientists from the JSPS (19H00367).</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>H.U., Y.I., Y.E., M.I. and H.I. participated in the design of the study.
