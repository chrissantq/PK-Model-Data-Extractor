Clinical pharmacists play a crucial role in optimizing anti-infection treatment strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist consultation on the treatment of inpatients with MDRO infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients infected with MDROs who received clinical pharmacist consultation between June 2020 and June 2023 were enrolled. The adoption rate and effectiveness rate of consultation were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors influencing the effectiveness rate of consultation. Cox regression analysis was employed to estimate the 30-day survival rate post-consultation for patients infected with MDROs, comparing those who adopting pharmacists&#8217; suggestions with those who did not.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 620 patients were included. More patients were from the surgical system, especially neurosurgery. The top 3 infection sites were respiratory tract, urinary tract and blood, with prevalent MDROs including Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP), Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA). Following the implementation of consultation recommendations, patients exhibited significant reductions in temperatures, inflammatory markers, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The adoption and effectiveness rate of consultation were 89.67% and 58.71%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that there were significant association of liver dysfunction (adjusted OR = 0.331, 95% CI: 0.217&#8211;0.504), severity of infection (adjusted OR = 0.292, 95% CI: 0.151&#8211;0.562) and adopting pharmacists&#8217; suggestions (adjusted OR = 1.987, 95% CI: 1.126&#8211;3.507) with the effectiveness rate of consultation. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant difference in the 30-day survival rate between MDRO patients who received pharmacist recommendations and those who did not (HR = 0.422, 95% CI: 0.185&#8211;0.963, P = 0.04).</p></sec><sec id="s2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our research indicated that the involvement of clinical pharmacists could be advantageous for patients afflicted with MDRO infections.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>multidrug-resistant organisms</kwd><kwd>infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>clinical pharmacists</kwd><kwd>consultations</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>No funding sources.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="8"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to human health. According to a recent study published in The Lancet in 2022, the Global Antibiotic Resistance Initiative estimated that 4.95 million deaths occurred worldwide in 2019 as a result of antibiotic resistance, including 1.27 million that were directly attributable to the drug.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Furthermore, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) found that the COVID-19 presented one of the greatest threats of the century and exacerbated the &#8220;silent pandemic&#8221; of AMR.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) play a key role in spreading various AMR genes and present a substantial challenge in clinical medicine.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> With the widespread use and even misuse of antibiotics, the emergence of MDROs has been steadily increasing. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has led to a steady increase in the emergence of MDROs, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (eg, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients infected with these MDROs often present with more severe conditions, have limited treatment options, and face higher mortality rates.</p><p>In hospital settings, effective treatment strategies are crucial for improving the prognosis of patients with MDRO infections.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Under traditional healthcare models, physicians primarily rely on their clinical experience and limited antimicrobial susceptibility testing data to formulate anti-infective treatment plans. However, factors such as drug&#8211;drug interactions, individual patient variability (eg, renal function, liver function, age, and other factors affecting drug metabolism), and the complex resistance mechanisms of MDROs can limit the effectiveness of therapy. Clinical pharmacists, as integral members of the healthcare team, possess unique expertise in medication therapy management.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In recent years, several Chinese policy documents have emphasized that clinical pharmacists should participate in the consultations for complex cases to provide treatment options or adjusting the drug regimen and share responsibility with physicians for medication.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previous literature has indicated that pharmacists&#8217; involvement in multidisciplinary teams (MDT) has become an emerging trend. This enables them to offer pharmaceutical expertise in clinical medication advice across various disciplines, including anti-infection, anticoagulation, gastroenterology, nutrition, and oncology.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In particular, clinical pharmacists were required to provide individualized recommendations in anti-infection consultation, which has became an integral part of clinical pharmacist consultation.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, there is limited research on this topic. Existing studies primarily focus on the clinical pharmacists&#8217; anti-infection experience in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, conducting a systematic retrospective observational study to explore the impact of clinical pharmacists&#8217; consultations on the treatment of MDRO infections and the factors influencing the effectiveness of consultations is of great practical significance for clarifying the role of clinical pharmacists within the MDRO infection treatment team and providing a scientific basis for clinical practice.</p><p>This single-center retrospective study aims to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacists&#8217; involvement in infectious disease consultations and to identify factors influencing the effectiveness of these consultations. The findings of this research may serve as a valuable reference for clinical pharmacists seeking to enhance their practice in the field of pharmaceutical care.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><p>We followed the STROBE Statement for cohort studies to conduct this study.</p><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>This study was conducted at Tongji University Affiliated East Hospital, a 2000-bed comprehensive hospital located in Shanghai, China. In accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration, the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji University Affiliated East Hospital approved this study design with approval number 2020173. It was a retrospective cohort study with an informed consent exemption. This study did not involve sensitive data, including personal information, privacy concerns, biological samples, or any elements that could pose risk or harm to the subjects. Consequently, the ethics committee determined that obtaining informed consent from participants was not necessary. For humanitarian reasons, clinical pharmacists fulfilled all consultation requests sent by clinicians; therefore, this study did not set the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2002"><title>Participants</title><p>In this study, patients with infection who were consulted by clinical pharmacists from June 2020 to June 2023 were included. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with non-MDRO infections; (2) patients received multidisciplinary consultations for complex cases; (3) patients for whom physicians requested consultation for the use of special antibiotics (eg, Carbapenems, Vancomycin, Tigecycline); and (4) patients discharged or died within 3 days after application of the clinical pharmacist&#8217;s treatment plan.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2003"><title>Clinical Pharmacists&#8217; Consultation Intervention</title><p>The study consultation intervention was described as follows: (1) Physicians sent consultation requests for MDRO infections to the clinical pharmacy department through the workstation; (2) Clinical pharmacists on the schedule were responsible for these consultations, and all clinical pharmacists had undergone national standardized training and had been engaged in clinical work for more than 5 years; (3) Clinical pharmacists made a comprehensive assessment of the infection status of the patient according to the clinical symptoms, laboratory examination, etiology examination and imaging examination results. Treatment recommendations were given based on patient characteristics (such as age, gender, liver and kidney function, underlying diseases, etc.), current best clinical evidence (evidence-based guidelines) and drug characteristics (antimicrobial profile, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic characteristics, adverse reactions, drug interactions, antimicrobial variety, dose, frequency of administration and course of treatment); (4) Physicians made the final decision on whether or not to adopt and implement these recommendations.</p><p>Physicians would evaluate the recommendations based on their own clinical judgment, the patient&#8217;s overall condition, and any other relevant factors specific to the case. In some instances, if there were concerns about the feasibility or safety of the proposed treatment, or if there were alternative treatment options that the physicians deemed more appropriate, they might choose not to follow the pharmacist&#8217;s recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2004"><title>Variables and Outcomes</title><p>In this investigation, the exposure factors under consideration were the extent to which physicians implemented the consultation recommendations and adhered to the anti-MDRO infection protocols proposed by clinical pharmacists. The treatment regimens outlined in the consultation documents were cross-referenced with what physicians actually prescribed, and instances of full or partial concordance were deemed indicative of acceptance of the consultation recommendations. The adoption rate was calculated as the proportion of accepted recommendations to the total requests made. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were effectively treated for anti-MDRO infection after physicians adopting consultation suggestions from pharmacists, which were regarded as effectiveness rate. The efficacy was evaluated 3 to 7 days after starting the recommended anti-infection regimen, with a 30-day follow-up period after consultation.</p><p>We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy following the Guiding Principles for the Clinical Application of Antimicrobial Agents (2015 edition).<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Effectiveness was operationally defined as the recovery or improvement in patients&#8217; symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and imaging results, with the bacteria transitioning to colonization and asymptomatic status. Any lack of improvement or worsening within 72&#160;hours after treatment was deemed invalid. The severity of infection and sepsis were determined on the basis of physicians&#8217; clinical judgment.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2005"><title>Data Collection and Management</title><p>The researchers constructed a comprehensive database to document pertinent information, including patients&#8217; demographic characteristics (age, sex), medical history (diagnosis, comorbidities), organ function (liver and kidney), laboratory parameters (temperature, infection indicators like WBC, CRP, PCT), pre- and post-treatment imaging findings, infection sites, bacterial culture results, drug susceptibility testing, distribution of patients across departments, infection severity, consultation duration, and clinical pharmacists&#8217; specialties. The data were extracted from inpatient electronic records and Hospital Information System (HIS). All procedures were performed independently by two pharmacists, and the validity and reliability of the assessments were confirmed by the third pharmacist.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2006"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Pareto charts were used to demonstrate the most common distribution of infection sites and MDROs in this study. Quantitative data were presented as mean &#177; standard deviation (SD), and qualitative data was given as number and percentage. To compare patient groups before and after treatments, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>-test was used. Frequency, rate, or proportion was utilized to count data, which were then analyzed by a chi-square test. Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curves were employed to analyze the survival status of the patients with CRKP, CRAB, CRPA, MRSA, and VRE infection. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to assess survival outcomes.</p><p>Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of the adherence to consultation advice and the effectiveness rate of anti-infection treatment, after adjustment for probable causes of both exposure and outcome. The covariates considered included age, sex, comorbidity, kidney and liver function, hypoproteinemia, type of departments, severity of infection and major of clinical pharmacists. Given the high correlation between patients&#8217; temperatures, inflammatory markers, site of infection, number of infection sites, and disease severity with the severity of infection, we exclusively incorporated the severity of infection into the multivariate analysis model. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed at the 0.05 level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0003-s2001"><title>Characteristics</title><p>A total of 1298 patients received anti-infection consultations between June 2020 and June 2023. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 620 patients infected with MDROs were enrolled in the final analysis (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

This discrepancy may reflect the complex clinical profiles of neurosurgical patients, including prolonged antibiotic exposure, invasive procedures, and suboptimal postoperative antimicrobial stewardship.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Consistent with global trends, respiratory tract infections (48.57%) dominated MDRO cases (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), with CRKP, CARB, CRPA, MRSA, and VRE being the most prevalent pathogens (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Inflammatory markers such as WBC, CRP, and PCT are widely used to monitor infection severity and therapeutic response.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our data demonstrated significant reductions in these biomarkers post-treatment (<xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), aligning with studies reporting declines within 3&#8211;7 days of anti-infective therapy.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, Schutz et al observed no significant differences in inflammatory markers between antibiotic-treated and untreated cohorts,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> underscoring the complexity of biomarker interpretation in heterogeneous patient populations. Additionally, improvements in SOFA scores (2.65 &#177; 1.63 vs 1.90 &#177; 1.22, p &lt; 0.001) and temperature normalization (59.52% vs 67.58%, p = 0.003) post-treatment suggested the alleviation of infectious symptoms (<xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Meanwhile, the results suggested that effective clinical interventions (eg, timely empirical or targeted antimicrobial therapy) may have mitigated the immediate mortality risk associated with these resistant organisms. Additionally, the host factors including comorbidities, infection site, and severity may play a more dominant role in short-term outcomes than resistance profiles alone. Furthermore, although the survival rate was higher in the pharmacist-adherent group compared to the non-adherent group for ICU patients, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The observed trend of higher survival rates in ICU patients receiving pharmacist-adherent care raised important considerations for antimicrobial stewardship in critical care settings. Notably, this is similar to the findings of J Zhang et al demonstrating pharmacist interventions reduced MDRO mortality in ventilated patients.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that receiving pharmacist advice was significantly associated with reduced mortality risk (p = 0.04) (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, we incorporated age (below or above 65 years), presence or absence of comorbidities, and ICU status (Yes/No) as dichotomous variables into a univariate Cox proportional hazards model (<xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The results indicated that only ICU status (Yes/No) was an important risk factor for patient survival. (p = 0.000). This finding contextualizes our earlier subgroup analysis: The non-significant survival trend in ICU patients (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) likely reflects competing risks inherent to critical illness. And the overwhelming impact of organ dysfunction in ICU settings may attenuate the measurable benefit of pharmaceutical interventions. This dichotomy underscores the necessity of early pharmacist involvement before progression to multiorgan failure. Additionally, the non-significance of age and comorbidities may be due to insufficient sample size and unadjusted confounders, such as specific disease types.</p><p>Most clinical pharmacists in China primarily manage clinical anti-infective treatment, yet the impact of pharmacist intervention in treating MDRO infections remains underexplored.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, the consultation adoption rate (89.67%, 556/620) exceeded rates reported in earlier infectious disease studies,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> likely due to heightened MDRO complexity necessitating multidisciplinary input. However, the effectiveness rate (58.71%, 364/620) was comparatively lower, potentially reflecting the enrollment of refractory cases with prolonged hospitalization, polymicrobial infections, and organ dysfunction.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The discrepancy in efficacy rates underscores the need for standardized outcome metrics in pharmacist intervention research.</p><p>Multivariate regression analysis identified liver dysfunction, severity of infection, and adherence to recommendations were independent variables influencing the efficacy of consultation in the treatment of patients with MDRO infections (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results were consistent with previous research findings.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The efficacy of therapy was influenced by multiple factors, primarily encompassing the pharmacological properties of the drug, the physiological and pathological condition of the patient, and the susceptibility of the pathogens to the medication.<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In our study, it was observed that patients with liver dysfunction exhibited a diminished response to anti-infection treatment (adjusted OR = 0.331, 95% CI: 0.217&#8211;0.504). Liver impairment compromises antibiotic metabolism (eg, &#946;-lactams, vancomycin), necessitating dose adjustments to avoid toxicity or subtherapeutic levels.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Previous studies has shown that the severity of infection was related to the prognosis of patients, and patients with severe infection had worse outcome.<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Sepsis severity, a well-established prognostic marker, likely reflects cumulative organ damage and immunoparalysis.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The low proportion of sepsis/septic shock cases (8.5%) in our study may limit the comprehensive evaluation of consultation efficacy in critically ill patients. Although subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant association between infection severity and treatment outcomes, the small sample size likely reduced statistical power. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate the specific impact of clinical pharmacists&#8217; interventions in critically ill populations. The significance of department type observed in the univariate analysis did not translate to a significant impact on consultation effectiveness in the multivariate model and subgroup analyses. This discrepancy may be explained by the homogeneity of the consulted cases, all of whom were patients with severe infections.</p><p>In the course of our study, the implementation of consultation recommendations resulted in a 1.987-fold increase in the efficacy of anti-infective treatment (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This finding underscored the significance of clinical pharmacist consultation for patients infected with MDROs. The incidence of MDRO infections has been linked to inappropriate or unnecessary antibiotic use in clinical settings.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Nevertheless, clinical pharmacist intervention has shown promise in curbing antibiotic usage and encouraging judicious prescribing practices. Numerous studies have shown that clinical pharmacists were essential members of the antimicrobial team, contributing to guideline development, prescription management, program evaluations, patient reviews, and optimizing antimicrobial therapy.<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47&#8211;51</xref> This highlights the vital importance of clinical pharmacists in managing infectious diseases, particularly in providing care to MDRO infected patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were some limitations in our study as follows: First of all, this was a single-center, retrospective study, which may have led to selective bias. However, our hospital is a comprehensive tertiary hospital in China, and patients from all over the country seek their medical services. Secondly, the lack of strict control for baseline balance between the exposed and control groups may have biased the study results. Finally, the results were still preliminary due to the small sample size for clinical pharmacist consultation intervention on treatment outcomes. Therefore, large-scale, multicenter prospective studies are needed to expand the sample size, especially in critically ill patients, and to include additional clinical outcome measures (eg, length of stay in the ICU, need for organ support) to more fully evaluate consultation outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study evaluated the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist consultations in the management of MDRO infections and investigated the factors impacting the success rate of these consultations. Our findings demonstrated a correlation between consultation effectiveness and patients&#8217; liver dysfunction, infection severity, and adherence to consultation recommendations by clinicians. These results suggested that clinical pharmacist interventions through consultations could be advantageous for patients with MDRO
