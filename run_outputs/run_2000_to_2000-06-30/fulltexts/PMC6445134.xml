In critical care scenarios, these types of devices could automate, for example, fluid resuscitation, drug delivery, mechanical ventilation, and/or anesthesia and sedation. Evidence from simulations using computational models of physiological systems can play a crucial role in the development of physiological closed-loop controlled devices; but the utility of this evidence will depend on the credibility of the computational model used. Computational models of physiological systems can be complex with numerous non-linearities, time-varying properties, and unknown parameters, which leads to challenges in model assessment. Given the wide range of potential uses of computational patient models in the design and evaluation of physiological closed-loop controlled systems, and the varying risks associated with the diverse uses, the specific model as well as the necessary evidence to make a model credible for a use case may vary. In this review, we examine the various uses of computational patient models in the design and evaluation of critical care physiological closed-loop controlled systems (e.g., hemodynamic stability, mechanical ventilation, anesthetic delivery) as well as the types of evidence (e.g., verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification activities) presented to support the model for that use. We then examine and discuss how a credibility assessment framework (American Society of Mechanical Engineers Verification and Validation Subcommittee, V&amp;V 40 Verification and Validation in Computational Modeling of Medical Devices) for medical devices can be applied to computational patient models used to test physiological closed-loop controlled systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mathematical physiological model</kwd><kwd>computational modeling and simulation testing</kwd><kwd>physiologic closed-loop control systems</kwd><kwd>model credibility evidence</kwd><kwd>medical devices</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="111"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Medical devices with PCLC technology automatically adjust therapy being delivered to a patient based on a measured physiological variable. Clinical environments such as critical care units could benefit from automated technologies because of the high number of required clinical actions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Embriaco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Mealer, 2016</xref>) and extensive monitoring and therapeutic devices already in use. For critically ill patients, PCLC technology may be used at the bedside to provide supportive therapy including automating fluid delivery (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Rinehart et al., 2014</xref>), mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Morozoff and Saif, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Tehrani, 2012</xref>), and/or anesthetic delivery (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>). However, the presence of control algorithms to automate therapeutic actions can introduce new hazards (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Parvinian et al., 2018</xref>) and thus a comprehensive safety assessment is crucial to their success.</p><p>Physiological closed-loop control medical devices are life-sustaining safety-critical systems and establishing their safety requires characterizing the performance under inter- and intra-patient variability, verifying system implementation, assessing the system response during expected functional and clinical disturbances, and assessing the clinical usability (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Parvinian et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence to demonstrate the performance and safety of any medical device, in general, can include a combination of data from bench, animal, clinical, and computational testing (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Faris and Shuren, 2017</xref>). For PCLC devices, the latter might involve running computer simulations that use the devices or models of the devices to control a <bold>computational model of patient physiology</bold>. Closed-loop systems in a wide range of engineering fields have a long history in model-based design and evaluation, in which the control algorithm or the hardware device is tested using computational models of the system. In the design phase, this can allow the control designer to acquire insights on system dynamics and enable rapid device iterations, lending confidence to a control algorithm by conferring a sufficient level of performance and robustness against conceivable variabilities and challenging scenarios. Model-based evaluation approaches can be used to rigorously stress controllers in a wide range of simulated scenarios. The type of testing can be either using completely <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> approaches where computational models of the patient and device components are used or hardware-in-the-loop methods where a CPM is used with the actual medical devices, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. For PCLC devices, these approaches have the potential to demonstrate performance and complement clinical trials by evaluating the device under a broader range of conditions that might not occur or be possible to evaluate in a clinical setting. Therefore, computational testing with mathematical models of patient physiology could advance the development of novel PCLC medical devices, and positively impact patient care, as long as the evidence is sufficiently credible for performance assessment.</p><fig id="F1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Computational test setups for physiological closed-loop controlled medical devices. <bold>(A)</bold> Fully computational testing uses computational models of the therapeutic delivery devices, sensors, and computational patient model. Initial conditions are set for the controller settings and patient, delivery device, and sensor models. Simulated disturbance profiles such as timing of injuries or other therapies are input to challenge the controller. The testing may be run within a single simulation environment. <bold>(B)</bold> Hardware-in-the-loop testing uses a computational patient model and one or more of the computational device models are replaced with the physical devices. This requires the use of actuator transfer mechanisms to convert therapy delivery device outputs to digital signals received by the computational physiological model and/or signal generators to convert the output of the computational patient model to signals that can be recorded by the patient monitor.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fphys-10-00220-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>A challenge to performing and relying on computational testing of PCLC systems is that it requires a computational model of the patient&#8217;s physiology. The physiology of interest can be complex with, for example, significant non-linearities and time-varying components (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hester et al., 2011</xref>). The degree to which the computational results can be relied upon as evidence of the device performance will heavily depend on the <bold>evidence supporting the credibility of the computational patient model to represent the relevant physiology</bold>. Therefore, for computational testing of safety-critical PCLC medical devices, the evidence supporting the CPM is a critical component to interpret and generate credibility in the computational testing simulations. The need for validating physiological models in a systematic way to increase credibility in the results that they generate has long been recognized (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cobelli et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>Establishing the credibility of a computational model involves gathering evidence from different activities, such as <italic toggle="yes">verification and validation (V&amp;V), calibration, identifiability and sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and applicability analysis</italic> (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for definitions). In the context of computational models, verification asks the question, &#8220;did you solve the equations correctly,&#8221; whereas validation asks, &#8220;did you solve the correct equations?&#8221; Validation involves comparing model results with real-world data. It is generally accepted that this data should be distinct to data used in model development, but otherwise the precise meaning of validation is subject to interpretation, both within communities (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Roache, 2009</xref>) and across communities (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bellocchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Pathmanathan and Gray, 2018</xref>). Calibration, or tuning, involves fitting parameters in the mathematical equations (i.e., model form or model structure), such that the output of the model has a &#8220;good&#8221; fit to experimental data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">Calibration</italic> is a model development activity and not a model assessment activity; nevertheless, calibration often results demonstrating good agreement are regularly presented as evidence for credibility of physiological models. <italic toggle="yes">Identifiability analysis</italic> evaluates the reliability of the parameter estimation procedure and resulting parameters (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cobelli et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Batzel et al., 2012</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Sensitivity analysis</italic> assesses how sensitive the model output is to different values of the model inputs (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Saltelli et al., 2008</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Uncertainty quantification</italic> involves identifying the sources of uncertainty in the model, quantifying the uncertainty of the sources using probability distributions, and then propagating the uncertainty through the model to determine the impact on the output (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2013</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Applicability analysis</italic> involves a systematic evaluation of the relevance of the validation evidence to support using the computational model for the specific proposed application of the model, or COU. This type of analysis can be done if validation evidence is already gathered or can be used for planning to gather evidence, and provides transparency on the assumptions and decisions made to use a model (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Pathmanathan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptions of terms important to establishing credibility of a computational model.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Term</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Context of use &#8211; COU</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A statement that defines the specific role and scope of the computational model used to address a question of interest (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>).<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Verification</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of determining that a computational model accurately represents the underlying mathematical model and its solution (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>).<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Validation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of determining the degree to which a model or a simulation is an accurate representation of the real world.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensitivity analysis</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of determining how a change in a model input (e.g., parameters or initial conditions) affects model outputs.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identifiability analysis</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of determining the reliability of parameter estimates from model structure and experimental data.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calibration</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of tuning or optimizing parameters in a computational model to minimize the difference between model outputs and real world data.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Uncertainty quantification &#8211; UQ</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of determining the uncertainty in model inputs (e.g., parameters or initial conditions) and computing the resultant uncertainty in model outputs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>).<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Applicability analysis</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The process of assessing the relevance of the validation activities for a computational model to support the use of that model for a COU (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>).<sup>d</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><attrib><italic toggle="yes">Additional comments are provided in the footnote. <sup><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></sup> The COU can also include the other sources of evidence that will support the question of interest. <sup><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></sup> Verification activities are outside the scope of our review. <sup><italic toggle="yes">c</italic></sup> Common reasons for uncertainty in model inputs are measurement error or inter-/intra-individual variability. <sup><italic toggle="yes">d</italic></sup> Detailed discussion in <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Pathmanathan et al.

For example, a CPM used in the early stages of designing a PCLC algorithm likely does not require the same rigor as a CPM used to determine the use population for the PCLC device. V&amp;V-based processes for model assessment are well-established in traditional engineering disciplines, although they continue to evolve; however, the same rigorous attention has yet to be given to biomedical applications. Therefore, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Verification and Validation Subcommittee, V&amp;V 40 Verification and Validation in Computational Modeling of Medical Devices (ASME V&amp;V 40) recently proposed a &#8220;risk-informed credibility assessment framework&#8221; to help determine the &#8220;amount of V&amp;V&#8221; needed to support using a computational model for applications related to medical devices (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>). With this framework in mind, we present a review of the current uses of CPMs in the development of critical care PCLC devices and the evidence used to support the CPM for that purpose. We focus on three PCLC device areas intended for critical care medicine: hemodynamic stability, mechanical ventilation, and anesthetic delivery.</p><p>Our objective was to review the potential roles of CPMs to answer questions about PCLC system design and/or evaluation, and to identify the credibility evidence that supported the CPM for that purpose. The scope of this review included CPMs that were mathematical models of individual physiological systems, data-driven models, integrated physiological systems models, or PK/PD models. We considered studies with PCLC related to hemodynamic stability (primarily fluid resuscitation or vasoactive drug delivery), anesthetic delivery, and mechanical ventilation. Studies of animal or clinical testing of a PCLC system without any computational testing using a CPM were out of scope. Moreover, while models of the closed-loop system components (e.g., physiological monitors, infusion pumps) need to be considered for computational testing of PCLC systems, these models were also out of scope. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between <italic toggle="yes">validating the controller</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">validating the CPM; our reviewed focused solely on the latter</italic>. We considered the following regarding the use of the CPM:</p><list list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple"><list-item><p>&#8226; the source of the model (whether designed for a specific COU in the article or taken from previous works or combination of two);</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; information on the selection of parameter values including if parameters were taken from previous studies, averaged over population, calibrated during the model development process, or combination of these methods;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; whether sensitivity and/or identifiability analyses were performed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; whether uncertainty quantification was performed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; comparisons of model performance to experimental data used in model development/training/calibration processes (e.g., quality of fit)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; independent validation data, namely the comparisons of model performance to experimental data not used in any stage of model development (e.g., quality of predictive performance)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; for models previously reported, justification provided to support credibility for the current COU in the article;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; and, for models modified from previous reports, justification provided as to why any previous validation still supports the model use given the changes to the model.</p></list-item></list><p>Sections &#8220;Closed-Loop Systems for Hemodynamic Stability,&#8221; &#8220;Closed-Loop Systems for Mechanical Ventilation,&#8221; and &#8220;Closed-Loop Systems for Anesthetic Delivery&#8221; review the identified uses and validation approaches of CPMs in the development and evaluation of PCLC systems for hemodynamic stability, mechanical ventilation, and anesthetic delivery systems, respectively. Section &#8220;Discussion&#8221; discusses the results of the review, provides an appraisal of the state of model credibility assessment in the reviewed literature as a whole, and frames the content in relation to physiological model validation frameworks and the recent ASME V&amp;V 40 framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Closed-Loop Systems for Hemodynamic Stability</title><sec><title>Use of Computational Patient Models</title><p>Physiological closed-loop control controllers have been developed for resuscitation and vasoactive drug delivery systems with the objective of performing fluid resuscitation and/or hemodynamic stability. These devices monitor and control hemodynamic variables such as MAP or CO. Controllers used in hemodynamic stability systems adjust the infusion rate and/or time of delivery of fluids (e.g., colloids, crystalloids, or blood) and/or vasoactive drugs (e.g., SNP, phenylephrine). A variety of controller designs have been tested with CPMs including single input-single output adaptive and model predictive controllers (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Malagutti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2017</xref>), rule-based learning systems (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Rinehart et al., 2011</xref>), PID controllers (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Wassar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bighamian et al., 2016</xref>), and multi-input&#8211;multi-output systems that control multiple drugs simultaneously (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Held and Roy, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Roy, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2000</xref>). System designs may include supervisory components that add a layer of safety by monitoring for known system limitations, such as noise/signal artifacts in the sensed physiological variables that could adversely impact the controller performance (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">artin et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have used CPMs to assess controller performance across a broad range of physiologic responses. This type of testing can help establish patient populations for which a new control algorithm may be safe for use by varying parameters within the CPM to represent different types of patients and expected responses. <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kashihara et al. (2004)</xref> developed a model to compare the robustness of various control algorithms to the sensitivity of the MAP response to norepinephrine. The evidence from the simulation studies were used to initiate animal studies to further evaluate their controller designs. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bighamian et al. (2016)</xref> developed 100 different configurations of a CPM representative of hypovolemia to assess their PID controller for a fluid resuscitation system against a range of autonomic, cardiac, and hemodynamic conditions by varying gain parameters in their model. Similarly, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Rinehart et al. (2013)</xref> assessed the robustness of their fluid resuscitation controller to varying patient weight and cardiac contractility. These types of studies enable an estimate of the potential distributions in controller performance metrics that may be expected and can be used to identify patient conditions that may result in unsafe controller performance.</p><p>Computational patient models are commonly used in the design and evaluation of closed-loop hemodynamic stability systems to assess controller performance and robustness to changing patient conditions over time. This allows an assessment of how the controller performs during intra-patient variability simulated by changing model parameters over time. A model of the MAP response to SNP designed to develop and test a controller to maintain MAP by titrating delivery of SNP (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Slate, 1981</xref>) has been modified and further expanded on by multiple groups for this purpose. These modified versions of the model have been used to design and evaluate controllers capable of tracking and responding to a patient with a changing physiological state (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Malagutti et al., 2013</xref>) and to address non-linear elements in the cardiovascular system (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Polycarpou and Conway, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gao and Er, 2005</xref>).

Advantages and benefits of model-based design and evaluation will become more pronounced as system complexity continues to grow. The future of automated critical care may include not only closed-loop control of a single physiological variable but simultaneous control of multiple physiological variables from independent devices (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bracco, 2011</xref>). These controllers will need to work in tandem to maintain the patient in a stable physiologic condition. There is a possibility, however, that the controllers may adversely affect one other, potentially creating hazardous conditions for the patient. Model-based design and evaluation has the versatility to quantitatively and systematically (i.e., in a modular approach) assess the potential impact of each controller on patient physiology and elucidate and properly mitigate potential risky conditions in which the controller(s) may fail or malfunction. However, the increased complexity in the control systems will require increasingly complex and sufficiently accurate patient models, and thus mechanisms to assess model credibility will need to be more rigorously employed. We identified several uses for CPMs in the design and evaluation of PCLC systems ranging from systematic design of controllers and control law, as part of the controller (e.g., model predictive control), evaluating controller performance to different patient responses, evaluating controller performance to changing responses over time, and integrating with the PCLC physical system to assess real-time performance and implementation of safety supervisory modes. We further provide a review of the credibility evidence provided to support a broad range of those uses and will discuss the ASME V&amp;V 40 framework.</p><sec><title>Modeling for Systematic and Iterative Design</title><p>Computational patient models used for design purposes may be termed &#8220;control oriented&#8221; or &#8220;control relevant&#8221; models characterized by low order, parsimonious in parameters, and linearizable models to enhance controllability and observability (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). They are generally used to synthesize a controller around an operating point and may not be applicable to a broad range of clinical (e.g., patient variability) and functional (e.g., noise disturbance) uncertainties. With this COU, CPMs are used with varying degrees of influence on controller function. For example, CPMs may be used for tuning PID controller gains (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Westover et al., 2015</xref>), to inform the next action and set point of a controller (e.g., adaptive and model predictive controllers) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Malagutti et al., 2013</xref>) or to synthesize controllers robust against uncertain conditions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hahn et al., 2012</xref>). Establishing the credibility of the CPMs for such uses may include evaluating qualitative (e.g., model order, simplicity, transparency) and quantitative (e.g., linearizability, identifiability, predictive accuracy) characteristics. However, the rigor of these activities may vary. For example, a model predictive controller may need more rigor in validation evidence as compared to a conventional PID controller due to influence of the model on controller output.</p></sec><sec><title>Modeling for Evaluation of Controller Designs</title><p>Although controllers are constantly evaluated in an iterative manner to enhance design, CPMs may also be used for final evaluation of controllers to inform risk analysis. Such evaluation may be conducted either completely <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Kovatchev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Parvinian et al., 2018</xref>) or using a physical system integrated with the computational model (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Parvinian et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This COU for the CPM requires them to represent a broad range of clinical and functional scenarios to be able to stress-test the controllers. The CPMs used for this context generally are more complex (i.e., have higher order and more parameters) compared to models used for systematic design of controllers. The credibility-related requirements for this COU overlap to some degree with those used for the design. For example, in both cases the models are expected to have identifiable parameters and model predictive accuracy. However, in the case of models used for final evaluation the rigor for each credibility factor may be higher due to the influence of the model on decision and decision consequences.</p><p>Few of the studies in both engineering and physiology fields included in this review have rigorously tackled the fundamental question of what makes a model sufficiently credible for a specific task in the design and evaluation of PCLC systems. With regards to evidence needed to assess credibility, we found a broad spectrum in the type and rigor of credibility evidence presented for CPMs, but there was no clear link between how the CPMs were used and the rigor and extent of the credibility evidence. The evidence ranged from mostly qualitative descriptive information and in some cases quantitative assessment of the model performance, although it is not always clear if this was performed on independent data or calibration data. The authors usually did not report on how the decision was made about the type and rigor of the credibility evidence needed to support the CPM and typically the details of such evidence were limited. Our review of CPMs for the COU of designing controllers indicates that most studies focus on developing and using simplified models through lumping of parameters and model order reduction in order to enhance feasibility of controller synthesis. In other words, most studies focused on whether a controller <italic toggle="yes">can</italic> be designed and not whether it <italic toggle="yes">should</italic> be designed using the investigated CPM. The degree to which quantitative credibility-related requirements such as predictive accuracy were considered is unclear for various applications in anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic stability articles reviewed.</p><p>While most of the studies presented some qualitative assessment of model output, the application of more formal assessment techniques that provide systematic and quantitative information about the model performance, such as sensitivity analyses, uncertainty quantification, and comparisons to independent experimental data to assess the predictive capability of the model was limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Uncertainty Quantification in PCLC Design and Evaluation</title><p>A significant model attribute affecting credibility of models used for both systematic design and evaluation of PCLC controllers is the ability of the model to capture interpatient and intra patient variability as well as variability in disturbance scenarios experienced by critical care patients. This variability inherently establishes merit for using a closed loop system to account for the effect of variability and disturbances on the system output and transfer it to the manipulated variable. Adequate characterization and quantification of uncertainty for an application can therefore result in much more robust controller design and more meaningful controller evaluation methods. Recently some of these challenges related to uncertainty in patient and system response to disturbances have formed the impetus for synthesizing PCLC controllers based on modern control synthesis methods based on robust control theory (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bibian et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>). While this type of controller presents a powerful tool with the potential to guarantee that control specifications such as stability and robustness are met, the models used in such methods need to produce clinically relevant and widely variable disturbance scenarios. Furthermore, uncertainty due to oversimplifying assumptions embedded in a CPM need to be considered. For robust control applications (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Westover et al., 2015</xref>), overall model uncertainty and the uncertainty bounds must be quantified and validated for model based design and evaluation. In medicine, such bounds will be a function of the patient population, patient characteristics, type of procedure, amount of drug infused, drug co-administration, and concomitant therapies.</p><p>Another method of handling inter-patient/intra-patient variability has been to design model predictive controllers (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Mahfouf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">M&#233;ndez et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, the model used for design of controllers is not static (as is the case with robust control). The model directly affects the outcome of the controller as it is part of it. For example, in model predictive control of anesthesia, a forecast of the output is communicated to the controller based on a mathematical model (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Mahfouf et al., 2003</xref>). As such the credibility evidence needed to establish validation and uncertainty quantification of such models for this COU may require greater rigor due to the consequence of model output on the control function.</p><p>The issue of modeling uncertainty in anesthesia and critical care environment specifically is further complicated by multi-endpoint nature of therapy. For example, delivery of anesthesia is inherently a multiple-input-multiple-output system consisting of hypnosis, analgesia, and NMB (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Beck, 2015</xref>). Most PK/PD models are designed for single input system and do not account for potential drug interactions. Furthermore PK/PD models are empirical and lack mechanistic insight into the physiological systems affecting the response. For example the pharmacodynamic parameter that represents sigmodicity of the effect does not have physiological relevance (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Beck, 2015</xref>). This may complicate parameter uncertainty quantification particularly for designing controllers to maintain and adjust physiological endpoints such as respiratory rate, cardiac output, and mean arterial pressure. This challenge is likely to surface when PCLC devices intended for anesthesia are designed to work in tandem with, for example, PCLC mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic stability devices.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous Work on Computational Physiological Model Validation</title><p>There are a number of contributors who helped lay the foundation for validation of physiological models. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cobelli et al. (1984)</xref> introduced a validation process for simple and complex physiological models. Simple models were regarded as those with plausibility of performing classical identification procedures whereas complex models were those with numerous parameters that made system identification and parameter estimation not possible. Their work outlines fundamental concepts to address credibility of models. They introduced concepts of model internal consistency, algorithmic validity, and external validity concepts such as empirical, theoretical, heuristics, and pragmatic validity. They also provide a step by step procedure for testing validity of simple models by first examining identifiability properties, followed by the goodness of fit, analysis of residual errors, and, finally, overall plausibility of model attributes (e.g., parameter, structure, behavior). For complex (and simple) models with unidentifiable parameters and for models with a small number of variables accessible for direct measurement, they recommend first employing model simplification, decomposition of a complex model into simpler sub-models, and improving experimental design/testability of the model, followed by performing adaptive fitting and finally checking for model plausibility. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Batzel et al. (2009)</xref> provided steps for model validation including classical and generalized sensitivity analysis, subset selection, evaluation of local characteristic of parameter estimation process, experimental design and data quality checks, and global analysis. <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Summers et al. (2009)</xref> also recognized that whenever possible, model outputs should be compared with experimental outcomes for more consequential conclusions about model validity. They summarized three criteria for supporting the validation of large-scale integrated physiological models including a qualitative assessment of changes in the model output and a quantitative assessment of the steady-state and dynamic response of the model, while noting that these activities should be performed considering the clinical COU of the model (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Summers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hester et al., 2011</xref>). Some recent articles proposed systematic assessment methods relevant to physiological models and these two in particular discuss the importance of identifying and, when possible, quantifying uncertainty (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Friedrich, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Whelan, 2017</xref>). While these frameworks present different methods for performing validation and assessing model performance, they do not present a method for determining the level of rigor or the extent of the evidence needed to determine that the model is sufficiently credible for a specific COU. Therefore, to complement the foundation studies, we present an overview of a new consensus standard from the subcommittee ASME V&amp;V 40. The standard presents a risk-informed credibility assessment framework developed by a broad range of stakeholders in the medical device industry (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ASME, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ASME V&amp;V 40 Framework</title><p>The framework presented in the ASME V&amp;V 40 Standard builds upon established V&amp;V methodologies and does not present a step-by-step guide on how to perform V&amp;V; rather it guides the user (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) to determine the necessary rigor of the V&amp;V activities to deem the model credible for a COU. Thus, the framework begins with the user defining the question(s) of interest, which includes identifying a decision to be made, and the COU, a statement that describes the specific role and scope of the computational model. The level of rigor of the V&amp;V is driven by model risk, the possibility that using the computational model to inform a decision can result in undesirable effects, such as patient harm. The main tenant of the V&amp;V 40 framework is that the level of credibility required is commensurate with model risk. Model risk is determined by assessing both the <italic toggle="yes">influence of the model</italic> on the question of interest as compared to the other available evidence, and the <italic toggle="yes">decision consequence</italic>, which is the potential outcome of an incorrect decision. It is important for the user of the framework to carefully consider these two aspects of model risk, because once model risk is established for a COU it is used to drive the selection of credibility goals for the activities to be performed to establish model credibility.</p><fig id="F2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Process diagram of the ASME V&amp;V 40 risk-informed credibility assessment framework.

The mechanism that drives credibility determination is 13 &#8216;credibility factors,&#8217; which define different steps in the V&amp;V process. As discussed above, the general V&amp;V process includes verification, validation and applicability analysis. These are well defined in other documents, such as the NASA standard for model credibility assessment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Administration NAAS, 2013</xref>) and a Sandia National Laboratories report (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Oberkampf et al., 2007</xref>). The V&amp;V 40 framework breaks down verification, validation, and applicability analysis into more discrete steps. For example, in the process of validation, it is critical to examine the details of the experimental comparator as well as the computational model. Therefore, the credibility factors for validation include: &#8220;model form&#8221; and &#8220;model inputs&#8221; for the computational model, and &#8220;test samples&#8221; and &#8220;test conditions&#8221; for the experimental comparator. For the computational model, the credibility factors assess the rigor of the sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification performed and for which parameters these should be performed. With respect to the experimental comparator, which can be data from bench, animal, or clinical experiments, the two credibility factors assess the samples on which the experiments are performed, the quantity of samples, the conditions under which the experiments are performed, and the variety and variability of those experiments, along with the assessment and quantification of experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, for validation is a credibility factor that involves the assessment of the nature and types of comparison between the outputs from the computational model and the experimental comparator (i.e., qualitative or quantitative), along with the level of agreement between computational model and experimental data. The level of agreement is an outcome from the comparison; whether the level of agreement is sufficient is linked to the requirements for the COU.</p><p>Finally, there are two credibility factors related to applicability analysis, the relevance of the validation activities to the COU, and the relevance of the model outputs that were validated to the model outputs used in the COU.</p><p>The V&amp;V 40 framework requires that a credibility goal be defined for each credibility factor, ideally before data are collected. After establishing credibility goals, activities to achieve the credibility goals are planned and then executed to gather the V&amp;V evidence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Other pertinent information that supports credibility may include historical evidence of the model predictive ability for other COUs. It is then assessed whether the credibility goals were met, i.e., that the model is sufficiently credible for the COU. If the credibility goals are not achieved, then the COU or aspects of the model can be changed (e.g., to reduce the model risk and therefore the credibility requirements), or additional V&amp;V activities can be performed. The final stage is to document the findings and include the rationale to support the assumptions and credibility goals for using the model in the proposed COU.</p><p>The ASME V&amp;V 40 framework can serve as a guide for using CPMs in a variety of research roles such as hypothesis generation. The primary question of how it applies to questions such as generating hypotheses for future experimental studies comes to how risks associated with inaccurate predictions in these scenarios are evaluated. In these scenarios, the model will typically be responsible for 100% of the decision made, but the decision consequence of an inaccurate prediction comes in terms of wasted experimental time and cost rather than patient safety, as we are considering in the current work. Depending on how a researcher values the risks associated with the hypothesis they will test, they can use those risks to determine credibility goals and follow the V&amp;V 40 framework accordingly. They could also use the approach to determine what might be necessary for using that same model for potential future uses as well by reviewing each credibility factor. This may lead to better planning of future studies and the information that it will be necessary to gather to support the CPM.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of V&amp;V 40 to Computational Patient Models for Testing PCLC Medical Devices</title><p>A simplified representation of how the V&amp;V 40 framework may apply to the use of CPMs in PCLC testing is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The first steps of the V&amp;V 40 framework are to define the question of interest and the COU of the physiological model. Box 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> highlights several COUs we identified that computational testing has been used for in the design and evaluation of PCLC devices. These include confirming the performance of supervisory systems and fallback modes in the presence of known disturbances (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">artin et al., 1992</xref>) and assessing the controller performance to maintain a physiological variable within a certain range under a range of patient conditions (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bighamian et al., 2016</xref>). These two COUs may not require the same CPM or the same levels of evidence demonstrating CPM performance, as discussed in our recent case study examining how the ASME V&amp;V 40 framework could be applied to evaluating automated fluid resuscitation systems (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Scully et al., 2018</xref>). When assessing the system against disturbances, a simple model of the physiological system may be sufficient, but the realism of the different disturbance modes (such as signal noise in an arterial pressure waveform) will impact the credibility of the testing results. When representing a range of patient conditions, a more complex CPM may be needed resulting in assessment of the CPM across the range of physiologic conditions used for testing to ensure that the model produces realistic and expected results. These specific requirements should consider the question of interest being addressed (Box 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The V&amp;V 40 framework requires an analysis of the risk associated with relying on the modeling results. For example, if test results from comprehensive animal studies are used alongside computational results to answer the question of interest, the influence of the model is lower and thus the credibility requirements may be lower. Alternatively, if results from computational testing alone will be used to make a high consequence decision, such as identifying a patient population a PCLC system is expected to safely be applied to in a clinical study, the credibility requirements for the model are expected to be higher.</p><fig id="F3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Workflow for generating evidence computational patient models during development of a physiological closed-loop controlled medical device using. The process begins with considering the question of interest (Box 1) that the computational patient model will be used to address. Next are the design of the computational test setup (Box 2) as well as establishment of the computational patient model credibility goals (Box 3). These are used to determine the evidence needed to support the use of the computational patient model (Box 4) for the particular question of interest. The evidence supporting the computational patient model credibility can be used to interpret the evidence from the computational device testing.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fphys-10-00220-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>In many of the articles reviewed, the CPM was used for both design and evaluation of controllers. Such overlapping roles for models with two distinctly different contexts of use requires the model to have credibility evidence for both uses. For example, the model needs to be simple and transparent enough to lend itself to controller design and at the same time be comprehensive enough to include the uncertainty and frequently occurring disturbances experienced by the patient and system. As models for design of controllers are often linearized, using the same model to challenge the controller and evaluate its safety may not be meaningful since the physiological process that the controller will be faced with is likely highly non-linear. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides examples of how use of a computational model for design and evaluation may lead to different credibility goals when following the credibility framework.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Application of the ASME V&amp;V 40 risk-informed credibility framework to two different scenarios using computational models in the development of physiological closed-loop controlled medical devices.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scenario 1</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scenario 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Question of interest</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Design a controller to keep the physiological variable within X% of a set-point</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Is a controller stable under variable patient conditions</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Context of use</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The controller will be synthesized by optimizing parameters to the computational patient model</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The computational patient model will be used to perform a risk-based evaluation of the controller performance before being used in clinical studies.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Model risk</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Influence on decision</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High &#8211; no other evidence will be used to support the decision</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High &#8211; no other evidence will be used to support the decision</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Consequence of decision</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low &#8211; following design of the controller, a series of studies including additional computational testing and animal studies will be performed to evaluate the controller performance before being used on patients</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High &#8211; use of the controller on patients could lead to injury</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Overall risk</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medium</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Example credibility factors</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Qualitative:</italic> Parsimonious, low order, transparent, physiological relevant <italic toggle="yes">Quantitative:</italic> Linearizable, identifiable, predictive accuracy, reproduces uncertainty bounds</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">Qualitative:</italic> Transparent, physiologically relevant <italic toggle="yes">Quantitative:</italic> Identifiable, predictive accuracy, reproduces uncertainty bounds, generalizable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Credibility activities</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Develop and perform plan to gather credibility evidence: experimental design, comparator (e.g., animal model), data analysis plan</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><attrib><italic toggle="yes">The two scenarios outline example model risk and credibility factors.

For a CPM, this includes the physiological systems, dynamic properties, and interactions between physiological systems that are modeled, together with the equations used to model those systems, properties and interactions. It may also include whether non-linearity or time-variance in parameters are considered. Much of this information may be supported by existing knowledge of physiology. The specific questions of the controller that will be addressed should be considered when determining the systems and properties important to the model. Uncertainty in the model form may come from physiological systems that are not modeled but known to interact with the system of interest, higher order dynamics that may have been linearized or simplified in the model, time-varying changes associated with physiological conditions or treatments, or stochastic properties in natural systems. Because of the myriad of possibilities that may influence the uncertainty of the model form, validation evidence comparing modeling results to independent experimental data to support that the model behaves as expected is a critical component of previous computational physiological model validation strategies (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cobelli et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hester et al., 2011</xref>). When developing credibility goals to support a specific use of a model, one should consider how these attributes may affect the specific testing results.</p><p>Model inputs is another credibility factor in the V&amp;V 40 framework. For CPMs, this include parameters determining the physiological properties of the modeled systems, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and any external conditions including those provided by the PCLC device. When using a CPM to assess inter-patient variability, the range of initial conditions that the model produces valid results for should be established. The selection of parameters their sensitivity may impact the CPM. Parameter uncertainty during calibration or any data-driven fitting process may need to be evaluated. Initial conditions that may need to be considered include the current physiological state of the patient that may be affected by the amount of drug already given to the patient at the start of closed-loop therapy, for example. For closed-loop devices that are applied while patient physiological and clinical conditions may be changing, the loading conditions (disturbances) of the model and simulation need to be considered in relation to the dynamics of the system. For example, if system identification techniques are used to develop a data-driven model from experiments with a known input (e.g., a fixed hemorrhage followed by constant infusion of fluids), the performance of the model under different input conditions may not be captured (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bighamian et al., 2018</xref>). This could result in the need to compare the model to a variety of experimental conditions that are expected in the clinical scenario.</p><p>The final credibility factor considered here is the applicability of the V&amp;V activities to the COU. In general, there are differences between how a model is validated and how it will be used (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Pathmanathan et al., 2017</xref>), and for CPMs these differences can be considerable. For CPM with COUs geared toward PCLC testing, this may include species differences if animal experiments are used to validate the CPMs that will then be used for human physiology, or differences in patient populations if, for example, a healthy volunteer study is used to validate a model used to test a device that will be used on critically ill patients. Another difference might be the timescale of the validation tests as compared to the COU simulations. For example, validation tests that occur over a short time period may not adequately test whether the model replicates slow or delayed physiological changes that could be important in the COU simulations. Therefore, additional support can aid in establishing credibility of COU predictions given these differences between the validation and COU settings. For example, this may include physiological justification that validation using animal experiments is sufficient, considering the known differences of that species with humans. Other laboratory, clinical and experimental conditions can be contrasted to how the PCLC device will be used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the large body of work to advance control technology in other fields, the challenge for advancing PCLC medical devices in critical care medicine may not come from the availability of control strategies but instead result from sufficient understanding and modeling of patient physiology. There are fundamental questions with regards to the rigor of credibility evidence that need to be addressed to validate CPMs for design and evaluation of PCLC devices. With well-characterized and credible models, model-based strategies can be applied to design, iterate, and evaluate PCLC devices. Current evidence for demonstrating that a model is credible in PCLC development varies considerably, and rationales linking the evidence supporting a model for a specific use are limited in scope and presentation. Presenting this evidence, ideally by following a pre-specified framework, can aid in establishing the credibility of PCLC testing with CPMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>The mention of commercial products, their sources, or their use in connection with material reported herein is not to be construed as either an actual or implied endorsement of such products by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BP reviewed the articles related to anesthesia, hemodynamic/fluid resuscitation, and mechanical ventilation.
