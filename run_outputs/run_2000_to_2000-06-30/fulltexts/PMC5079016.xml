</p></notes></front><body><sec id="jah31702-sec-0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nitric oxide (NO) donors are a class of vasorelaxant drugs that have been used for over a century in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Commercially available, orally administered organic nitrate NO donors such as nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) are indicated for the treatment of angina. The general mechanism of action for NO involves stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), subsequent formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP), and consequent activation of protein kinase G, which downstream leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Clinically, this vasorelaxation leads to decreased preload, afterload, blood pressure (BP), and propensity for cardiac vasospasm as well as dilation of large coronary arteries. NO is also known to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, although the clinical relevance of these properties is not well characterized.<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p><p>Despite the critical importance of NO to regulation of cardiovascular physiology, the use of organic nitrate NO donors for the management of chronic cardiovascular disease has been limited, primarily due to the development of tolerance to the clinical and physiological effects of these&#160;compounds upon continuous administration. Although long&#8208;term administration of organic nitrates is utilized in selected patients, a nitrate&#8208;free period must be employed to avoid the development of tolerance, a strategy that can lead to fluctuations in BP control and/or increased incidence of symptoms and cardiac ischemic events.<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> The mechanism of tolerance has been thoroughly investigated but remains elusive and highly debated,<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> although metabolism and bioconversion to NO have been shown to play an important role.<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> In addition to inducing tolerance, organic nitrate NO donors also have a notable side effect profile that includes headaches, dizziness, and hypotension. Clinical studies suggest that slower onset of action and reduced peak&#8208;to&#8208;trough ratio of BP effects can help mitigate the severity of such symptoms.</p><p>Based on the clinical limitations of currently available organic nitrates, our group perceived an unmet medical need for an NO donor that (1) does not induce tolerance, (2) has reduced peak&#8208;to&#8208;trough pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) ratios, and (3) has a slower onset of action compared with currently available organic NO donors. We hypothesized that a molecule undergoing unique metabolic release of NO <italic toggle="yes">in&#160;vivo</italic> would potentially circumvent the development of tolerance. Initially, we identified a novel chemical series of <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>

<italic toggle="yes">&#8208;</italic>alkylated diazeniumdiolate NO donors that had hitherto been studied but, to the best of our knowledge, had not yet advanced into clinical trials involving hypertensive patients.<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> We postulated that the mechanism of NO release from these molecules would be unique in relation to that of organic nitrates in that it would occur slowly through cytochrome P450 metabolism and therefore, potentially overcome tolerance by offering improved kinetics. Additionally, early preclinical studies with these molecules showed improved PK properties, extended duration of action, and minimal peak&#8208;to&#8208;trough ratio, and we envisioned that these properties could potentially translate to an improved tolerability profile relative to that of existing organic nitrates. The present report describes the preclinical and clinical development of the diazeniumdiolate NO donor MK&#8208;8150.</p></sec><sec id="jah31702-sec-0006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="jah31702-sec-0007"><title>Preclinical Studies</title><sec id="jah31702-sec-0008"><title>Chemistry</title><p>The novel <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>

Prior to dosing, BP and HR were recorded for 24&#160;hours to derive baseline values and to sort animals into BP&#8208;matched groups. In the single&#8208;dose study, 3 groups (n=6 per group) of male adult beagle dogs (10.8&#8208;14.6&#160;kg) were given a dose of vehicle by oral gavage. Forty&#8208;eight hours later, 1 group of animals was given a second dose of vehicle as control, while the other 2 groups were treated with either 1.0 or 3.0&#160;mg/kg of MK&#8208;8150. In the multiple&#8208;dose study, 2 groups (n=6 per group) of male adult beagle dogs (10.4&#8208;14.2&#160;kg) were administered a dose of vehicle on day 0 by oral gavage.

Trough PK measurements at 24&#160;hours post&#8211;drug administration were obtained on days 1, 5, 8, 11, and 14. MK&#8208;8150 was formulated in a mixed vehicle composed of 70% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and 30% H<sub>2</sub>O (v/v) and was administered at a volume of 1.0&#160;mL/kg in both the single&#8208;treatment and 14&#8208;day studies.</p><p>In the single&#8208;dose study, the pressure sensor of the telemetry device was placed in the upper thoracic aorta per device design to measure central BP, whereas in the 14&#8208;day study, the pressure catheter was placed in a femoral artery to record peripheral BP. In both cases, BP signals were recorded continuously throughout the course of the study using device&#8208;specific data acquisition software (CA Recorder, DISS LLC, Dexter, MI; or DataQuest ART, DSI, New Brighton, MN).

In each of the first 4 panels (1&#8208;4), 8 male patients with hypertension received once&#8208;daily MK&#8208;8150 (n=6) 5, 10, 15, or 20&#160;mg, or placebo (n=2), for 10 consecutive days (days 1&#8208;10).

Based on single&#8208; and multiple&#8208;dose clinical data, PK and PK/PD models were developed to characterize the exposure&#8208;response relationship and to select doses for the clinical studies. The PK model consisted of a standard 2&#8208;compartment model. Because BP exhibits circadian variations over a 24&#8208;hour period, a circadian rhythm model was developed using clinical data from these studies. Subsequently, a placebo model was used to describe the placebo data. Subjects with higher baseline BP were observed to have a larger drug effect, so a baseline BP covariate modulating the efficacy of the compound was incorporated; age covaried significantly with baseline BP. A direct&#8208;effect model was employed, and the drug effect was captured with a standard E<sub>max</sub> model. A modulation of the EC<sub>50</sub> of the PK/PD relationship over time was used to describe the change in the PK/PD relationship that occurred over time in the MD studies.</p></sec><sec id="jah31702-sec-0016"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Ordinary 1&#8208;way ANOVA and the Bonferroni multiple&#8208;comparison procedure were adopted in the single&#8208;dose canine study to detect significance between treatment groups.

Summary statistics and plots were generated for the change from baseline values, as deemed clinically appropriate for safety endpoints. All panels were included in the PD analyses, and placebo data (pd) were pooled across panels as appropriate (panels 1 to 4 were pooled, 5 and 6 were pooled, panels 9 and 10 were pooled). A trapezoidal method was used to calculate the area under the curve for each pd parameter; a PROC MIXED model (version SAS9.3) was used to assess each pd parameter with covariates of baseline, day, treatment and treatment&#8208;by&#8208;day interaction terms, and a repeated day term with a random subject term assuming compound symmetry covariance structure.</p><p>For each of the PD objectives (SBP and HR), the summary statistics for each dose was provided with a corresponding 90% confidence interval for the comparison of interest (each MK&#8208;8150 dose&#8212;placebo). Descriptive statistics were also provided by treatment and day for each PK parameter.

The key pharmacologic differentiator for MK&#8208;8150 is its unique biochemistry of NO release through metabolism by CYP3A4, which, in&#160;vitro, allows for comparatively slow and steady release of NO. We hypothesized that this unique metabolic mechanism of NO generation would (1) be less prone to induce tolerance in humans because the biochemistry of NO generation and metabolism from organic nitrate NO donors is thought to be a contributor to the mechanism of nitrate tolerance, and (2) improve safety and tolerability in humans by delivering a consistent concentration of NO over time with a slow initial onset and reduced peak:trough ratio. In vitro liver preparation studies using analysis of concurrently formed metabolites across species (rat, dog, and human) convincingly demonstrated the production of NO from MK&#8208;8150 through a CYP3A4&#8208;mediated metabolic step. The slow rate of this metabolic step resulted in a sluggish production of NO in&#160;vitro, supporting the desired target profile of the drug. In vitro evidence of NO release was corroborated by demonstration of increased cGMP levels with Compound 2, a close diazeniumdiolate analogue of MK&#8208;8150.</p><p>In the dog, a single 3&#160;mg/kg dose of MK&#8208;8150 lowered SBP by ~20&#160;mm&#160;Hg. Peak BP&#8208;lowering response was reached at ~2&#160;hours post treatment and lasted up to 18 to 20&#160;hours. A desirable peak:trough BP&#8208;lowering ratio of &lt;2 was achieved. In contrast, peak BP&#8208;lowering response to ISMN occurred within 1&#160;hour, and the effect lasted ~12&#160;hours (data not shown). The relatively slow onset of BP lowering and longer&#8208;lasting effect of MK&#8208;8150 confirmed the NO release kinetics observed in&#160;vitro and presented a favorable in&#160;vivo PD profile in animals. In the 14&#8208;day study, a similarly robust BP&#8208;lowering response was observed for the full duration of the study, which suggested that MK&#8208;8150 may be able to overcome tolerance. However, the half&#8208;life of MK&#8208;8150 in dogs was 19&#160;hours, as opposed to it being up to ~79&#160;hours in humans from the MD study findings.</p><p>Based on its encouraging overall preclinical profile, MK&#8208;8150 was advanced into the clinic. Nitrates have multiple physiologic cardiovascular effects in humans, and we focused on peripheral BP as a biomarker for NO generation and pharmacologic activity in our early clinical studies. The SAD study showed robust BP&#8208;lowering efficacy in both healthy (data not shown) and hypertensive patients, although the onset was somewhat faster than (T<sub>max</sub>=1&#8208;2&#160;hours), and the resulting PD and tolerability were somewhat different from those predicted by preclinical studies. The reductions in pSBP and pDBP at T<sub>max</sub> approached 30&#160;mm&#160;Hg. Headaches were common at high doses, although they were generally mild or moderate in intensity and usually resolved spontaneously without treatment. Importantly, the half&#8208;life of MK&#8208;8150 was found to range from ~46 to 78&#160;hours, suggesting that once&#8208;daily dosing would be feasible, although it did raise some concerns about the accumulation ratio of MK&#8208;8150 and what this would mean clinically with regard to PD effects. Nonetheless, we were eager to determine whether the hemodynamic effects would be sustained in MD studies, as was observed in our telemetered dog experiments.</p><p>Because tolerance to nitrovasodilators generally begins to develop after 24 to 48&#160;hours of continuous dosing, we initially conducted a 10&#8208;day MD study with MK&#8208;8150 in hypertensive patients. Our results showed significant BP lowering with MK&#8208;8150 on day 1, but this effect was not fully maintained after 10&#160;days of daily dosing. As the concentration of MK&#8208;8150 was found to increase 2.8&#8208; to 3.7&#8208;fold on day 10 compared with day 1, the compound was well tolerated, but the diminishing PK/PD response was concerning, as it indicated the potential development of tolerance.</p><p>In order to investigate the apparent erosion of the PK/PD relationship over time in the 10&#8208;day studies and to further evaluate the durability of MK&#8208;8150's hemodynamic effects, a 28&#8208;day MD study was undertaken, and full 24&#8208;hour BP monitoring was performed once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28. Despite potent BP lowering on day 1, all BP&#8208;lowering effects of MK&#8208;8150 relative to placebo were lost by day 28, and this occurred despite an ~7&#8208;fold increase in MK&#8208;8150 concentration on day 28 relative to day 1. Thus, the apparent uncoupling of PK from PD seen on day 10 in the 10&#8208;day study continued, such that there was a complete loss of BP&#8208;lowering response after 28&#160;days of daily MK&#8208;8150. The tolerability profile of MK&#8208;8150 improved over time, with the incidence of headache, which is generally thought to be secondary to NO exposure,<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> ultimately decreasing to 0% on day 28 across all studies. A second 28&#8208;day study in 18 hypertensive subjects testing higher doses up to 40&#160;mg MK&#8208;8150 daily (Panel 10) also showed a complete loss of BP&#8208;lowering effect on day 28 compared to day 1 (data not shown).</p><p>These results raise many questions regarding the investigation and development of novel NO donors and the mechanism of tolerance to these active molecules. First, the durable effects of MK&#8208;8150 in the 14&#8208;day dog study, which did not reveal evidence of tolerance, did not translate to humans. However, it is certainly possible that the dogs would have developed tolerance to MK&#8208;8150 if the treatment period had been extended to 28&#160;days, as observed in humans. Further, there was significant compound accumulation on chronic administration of MK&#8208;8150 in humans (3&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold after 10&#160;days and up to 7&#8208;fold after 28&#160;days), while concentrations of MK&#8208;8150 and its metabolites were almost identical on day 1 and day 14 in the dog (0.436&#160;&#956;mol/L on day 1 vs 0.456&#160;&#956;mol/L on day 14). It is not known whether accumulation of MK&#8208;8150 in humans was a contributory factor to the observance of tolerance.</p><p>The explanation for the loss of BP lowering over time with MK&#8208;8150 in humans is likely multifactorial. Chronic pharmacologic BP lowering with NO donors generally leads to neurohormonal activation, vasoconstriction, and volume expansion, a phenomenon dubbed pseudotolerance in the literature,<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and there was almost certainly an element of this at play in our MD clinical studies. Other potential contributors are altered metabolism of MK&#8208;8150 over time, leading to a decrease or loss of NO generation by day 28, and increased NO clearance over time. Munzel and others have extensively studied the role of reactive oxygen species as NO scavengers, and tolerant blood vessels have been shown to have higher levels of reactive oxygen species than normal vessels.<xref rid="jah31702-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jah31702-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> This is thought to occur because organic nitrates induce oxidative stress in the vasculature.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that despite robust BP lowering during the first 1 to 2&#160;weeks of MK&#8208;8150 administration, the effects ultimately waned over 28&#160;days of daily dosing in humans. These findings reinforce the prevailing view that the development of tolerance to NO donors is a complicated and likely multifactorial process and demonstrate that utilizing a novel mechanism of NO release through CYP3A4 metabolism was ultimately insufficient to overcome the development of tolerance to the BP&#8208;lowering effects of this novel NO donor.</p></sec><sec id="jah31702-sec-0026"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Knox, de Kam, Azer, Wong, Ederveen, Shevell, Morabito, Meehan, Liu, Reynders, Denef, Mitselos, Jonathan, Gutstein, Mitra, Sun, Lo, Cully, and A.
