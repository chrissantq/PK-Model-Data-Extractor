In addition, a small number of Sprague Dawley rats were treated as concurrent vehicle and positive controls due to the lack of laboratory historical control data in Fischer F344 rats. Animals were housed in wire topped, solid bottomed cages, with a maximum of three animals of the same sex per cage. For periods of time not exceeding 24 h, rats scheduled for urinalysis were housed individually in urine collection cages.

The liver was selected as it is the primary site for metabolism of HQ and liver adenomas have been reported in HQ-treated mice. The duodenum was selected as a key site of contact following oral administration instead of the (fore)stomach to include possible enterohepatic recirculation of HQ metabolites.

No clinical signs of toxicity were observed at 300 mg/kg/day. At 420 mg/kg/day, only mild, transient signs were observed (piloerection solely in male animals approximately 1&#8722;2 h after the second administration). More severe signs (including tremors, decreased activity and hunched posture) were observed at the higher doses with animals reported to be moribund or mortality observed. From these results 420 mg/kg/day was considered to be an appropriate estimate of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and was therefore selected as the maximum dose for the comet assay.

Values obtained from each parameter were treated as follows: the median value per slide was calculated, the mean of the slide medians was calculated to give the mean animal value, and the mean of the animal means and standard error of the mean was calculated for each group. Median tail intensity data were used for statistical analysis. The positive control groups were compared to the vehicle control groups using a two-sample t test. The test was interpreted with one-sided risk for increased response with increasing dose. The vehicle control group and the treated groups were analyzed separately using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). An overall dose response test was performed along with Dunnett&#8217;s test for pairwise comparisons of each treated group with the vehicle control. For all tissues, the tests were interpreted with a one-sided risk. Levene's test for equality of variances between the groups was performed and where this showed evidence of heterogeneity (p &#8804; 0.01), the data was rank transformed prior to analysis.</p><p id="par0160">High levels of &#8216;hedgehogs&#8217; indicated the nuclear complex had been significantly fragmented and was considered evidence of excessive DNA damage. Such damage may be due to the cytotoxic nature of the treatment or due to excessive mechanical disruption during cell isolation, which had the potential to interfere with comet analysis.</p><p id="par0165">The data were considered valid if the following criteria were met: there was a marked increase in group mean positive control values compared to the concurrent vehicle control and the high dose was determined to be a MTD, the maximum recommended dose or the maximum practicable dose. Data from control F344 rats were compared to data from control Sprague Dawley (data not shown). As the values were considered comparable it was considered acceptable to use the laboratory&#8217;s historical control data in Sprague Dawley rats for data evaluation.</p><p id="par0170">HQ was considered to induce DNA damage if: (i) at least one of the test doses exhibited a statistically significant increase in tail intensity, in any tissue, compared with the concurrent vehicle control and, (ii) the increase in tail intensity was dose-related in any tissue. HQ was considered positive in this assay if both of the above criteria were met but negative in this assay if neither of the above criteria were met.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0055"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec0060"><label>3.1</label><title>Systemic toxicity: assessment of the MTD for evidence of systemic HQ exposure</title><p id="par0175">No obvious clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals following treatments with vehicle, EMS, or HQ (105, 210 or 420 mg/kg/day) during the comet assay. As was observed in the range-finding study, clinical responses to HQ were subtle at 420 mg/kg with signs of twitching (tremors) and vocalization reported for one female rat. Similar signs were observed in male rats during the range-finding study at the same dose level and were previously reported by Topping et al. [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As seen in the range-finding study increasing the dose of HQ by about 50 % to 600 mg/kg results in much more serious effects and mortality. No treatment related mortality was observed in the current study.</p><p id="par0180">Urine collected from all high dose animals was reported to be darker in color than the concurrent control group. This was also reported in other studies [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The darker urine color was attributed to metabolites of HQ and was considered evidence of renal exposure following oral gavage dosing.</p><p id="par0185">Body weight gain was reduced for both male (3.3 g, n = 18) and female (4.0 g, n = 12) animals given 420 mg/kg HQ when compared to the male (8.4 g, n = 18) and female (6.2 g, n = 12) negative control animals. The reduction in weight gain was greater for males (38 %) <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. females (16 %). No consistent reduction in weight gain was observed at lower HQ dose levels.</p><p id="par0190">There were no macroscopic findings considered to be related to administration of HQ. Microscopically, there were findings in the liver and kidneys, but none in the duodenum and testes. Clinical chemistry results showed some increases and some decreases in results; however, except for those discussed below there was no correlation with the animals&#8217; clinical status.</p><p id="par0195">A decrease in glycogen vacuolation, which indicates increased utilization of glycogen stored in the liver, was observed in the liver of male rats given 210 or 420 mg/kg/day and in female rats from all HQ-treated groups. The reduction in stored glycogen is possibly due to increased metabolism in the liver or systemically, rather than a pathologic change. In the liver, increased hepatocyte mitosis was present in rats from all HQ-treated groups, with a generally dose-related effect. The increased hepatocyte mitosis seen in rats from all HQ-treated groups is also considered an early indication of increased hepatocyte metabolism. Focal necrosis, characterized by an area of necrotic hepatocytes, with some inflammation, and by scattered eosinophilic and/or shrunken hepatocytes, often with pyknotic nuclei, was observed in one of six male rats given 420 mg/kg/day HQ. The AST and ALT values for individual male and female rats in the HQ-dosed groups were elevated above control levels. The only statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were observed for the mean values for the high dose groups (male and female ALT and AST).</p><p id="par0200">In the kidneys, acute renal tubular necrosis was present in males and females given 210 or 420 mg/kg/day. Renal changes were of greater severity and/or incidence in males and correlated with increased urea and/or creatinine in these animals. The changes in the renal tubules were characterized by hypereosinophilia of the mid cortical band corresponding with the S3 segment of the proximal tubules with occasional shrunken hypereosinophilic tubular cells with pyknotic nuclei at the minimal severity grade. At the higher severity grades, there was loss of cellular detail, cell swelling, and hypoeosinophilia, karyolysis and destruction of tubular cells in the S3 segment of the proximal convoluted tubule, with intralumenal debris. The incidence of histopathologic lesions in the kidneys from 12 animals per sex dosed with HQ are shown in <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The 105 mg/kg dose level was a NOEL for acute renal tubular necrosis. At the 210 mg/kg HQ/day dose level, only 1 of 12 males and 1 of 12 females were affected with minimal changes. At 420 mg/kg HQ/day, 9 of 12 females and 11 of 12 males showed renal tubular necrosis, which was not only more frequent in male rats but was also graded at a higher severity level. Creatinine values for individual male and female rats in the high dose group were elevated and urea nitrogen was elevated for some male high dose rats. These clinical chemistry changes are consistent with the renal tubule changes present microscopically.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0005" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Incidence of Acute Renal Tubular Necrosis in F344 Rats Given Hydroquinone by Gavage.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Dose Level (mg/kg/day)</th><th colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Males<hr/></th><th colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Females<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">105</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">210</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">420</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">105</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">210</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">420</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No. examined</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Severity Grade 0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="par0205">The MTD (420 mg/kg/day) was considered acceptable based on the severity of the observations seen at higher doses in the range-finder experiment and the dose-related decrease in body weight gain and histopathologic changes observed in the groups of males and females dosed with HQ contrasted with the concurrent F344 vehicle control groups.

conclusion</title><p id="par0230">The <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> alkaline comet assay was conducted as part of the European Union Community Rolling Action Plan (CoRAP) to clarify concerns for human health based on the possible carcinogenicity of HQ due to genetic damage. The initial requirement included exposing rats to HQ orally and assessing genotoxicity in contact tissue, target sites of metabolism, target organs and gonads in either a transgenic rodent somatic and germ cell mutation assay (TGR), or an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> comet assay. Both of these assays have been completed according to recent OECD test guidelines and have shown no evidence of gene mutation or DNA strand breaks in two different rodent species at MTD levels and with examination of target tissues.</p><p id="par0235">Matsumoto et al. [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] completed a <italic toggle="yes">lacZ</italic> transgenic mutation assay (OECD Test Guideline 488) in male Muta&#8482; mice by administering HQ orally at dose levels of 0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg bw/day for 28 days, which was an MTD that decreased body weight gain in all HQ treatment groups. They found no significant differences in mutant frequencies in the liver, stomach, lung, thyroid, or kidney between HQ-treated mice and controls. Matsumoto et al. [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] did not include gonadal tissue in their analysis.</p><p id="par0240">Our assay similarly found that HQ given orally with two administrations over 24 h at an MTD level of 420 mg/kg bw/day did not induce DNA strand breaks in male or female rat duodenum, liver or kidneys or in male testes. The study was also intended to address further concerns regarding potential germ cell mutagenesis, using analysis of gonadal cells as a surrogate to germ cells [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Exposure of the testes following HQ oral administration was demonstrated in an earlier toxicokinetics study that showed <sup>14</sup>C label, although at minor levels (much lower than in liver and kidneys), in testes of male F344 rats at 48 h following a single oral dose of 350 mg/kg [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present study no DNA strand breaks were detected in rat testes following two consecutive oral administrations at 420 mg/kg, indicating HQ (or its metabolites) has no significant interaction with the genetic material of gonadal cells, and thus no obvious potential germ cell mutagenic effect.</p><p id="par0245">These new results add to a large number of existing genotoxicity data, and contrast with previously reported positive effects including induction of micronuclei, chromosome aberrations, and chromosome loss, particularly following intraperitoneal administration of HQ, or when studied <italic toggle="yes">in vitro.</italic> Understanding the differences in genotoxicity results is important because HQ exposure through food sources is common and may increase with recommendations to improve the human diet with larger intakes of fruits and vegetables. In addition, a better understanding of these results for HQ may aid in assessing the risks associated with non-compliance with the European Union Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 affecting consumer exposure to previously allowed skin preparations [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="par0250">HQ has been extensively studied for genotoxicity and the results of these studies have been reviewed multiple times [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Generally, HQ is considered not to cause gene mutations in <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> assays and Kari [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] provides an example of a negative Ames/<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> assay with and without metabolic activation where the purity and stability of the HQ used for testing is documented. There is some apparent gene mutagenicity in mammalian cells as summarized by [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although a closer evaluation of the mouse lymphoma data (summarized in [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) using the global evaluation factor as described by OECD test guideline 490 (2016), suggests that the positive effects in this assay occur at concentrations that induce excessive toxicity.</p><p id="par0255">HQ is widely reported to induce chromosome damage and/or loss both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> in several cell types, or <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in mice. IARC [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] concluded that hydroquinone induced micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow in several studies but not sister chromatid exchanges in a single study. IARC also reported that hyperploidy and chromosome loss (as demonstrated by centromere-positive micronuclei), but not polyploidy, were also found in mouse bone marrow. These effects are consistent with HQ having an aneugenic effect. Many of these studies were reviewed by McGregor [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], who concluded that at least a portion, if not all, of the chromosomal effects observed in these studies were caused by interference by HQ or its metabolites with chromosomal segregation, probably due to interaction with mitotic spindle proteins, which is a non-DNA reactive mechanism for aneugenicity. McGregor [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] also noted that the majority of the positive findings <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> were in studies that used intraperitoneal injection, a physiologically irrelevant route of exposure that is no longer recommended for routine safety evaluation. Of the five studies reviewed by McGregor [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that used the oral route, four were clearly negative for genotoxicity.</p><p id="par0260">Jurica et al. [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported low levels of DNA damage in white blood cells from rats exposed to 200 mg HQ/kg bw orally by gavage for 14 or 28 consecutive days. Peripheral blood samples were taken 24 h after the final dose administration and processed through the alkaline comet assay. The authors describe the extent of DNA damage observed (&lt;10 % DNA in the comet tail) as being low genotoxicity; however, the biological relevance of these findings is highly questionable and most likely reflects natural variation in background DNA damage observed in the authors&#8217; laboratory. They report a statistically significant decrease in tail length, tail intensity, and tail moment in male rats treated with 200 mg HQ/kg bw over 14 days compared to the control animals (which received 14 gavage administrations of bidistilled water), but an increase in tail length and tail moment (but not tail intensity) in male rats administered the same dose over a 28 day period. No statistically significant DNA damage (in any parameter measured) was observed in female rats treated with 200 mg HQ/kg bw over 14 days but a significant decrease in tail length (but not tail moment or tail intensity) was observed after 28 days administration. The authors do not report historical vehicle control data for the three comet parameters measured; however, examination of the 14 and 28 day data reported for male and female bidistilled water control animals reveals a wide range of background values that generally encompass the values presented for HQ-treated animals. Overall, the data presented by Jurica et al. [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] display no evidence that HQ induces DNA damage (as detected by the comet assay) in the white blood cells of rats treated with HQ over 14 or 28 days.</p><p id="par0265">Consistent with McGregor&#8217;s observations, English et al. [<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that oral administration of HQ for 6 weeks at a nephrotoxic dose (50 mg/kg) did not produce covalent DNA adducts in the kidneys of rats when tested in a <sup>32</sup>P- post labelling assay.</p><p id="par0270">The results of the current <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> alkaline comet study demonstrate HQ did not cause DNA damage at much higher exposure levels in rats. There was also no evidence of gene mutations in the TGR assay in mice. Both of these assays are sensitive to gene mutations, with the comet assay also able to detect chromosome damage that is expressed as DNA strand breaks. However, neither assay is sensitive to chromosome loss and therefore these findings add further weight of evidence to the arguments of McGregor [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], that HQ genotoxicity is expressed predominately through an aneugenic (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> chromosome loss) mechanism when tested <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and following ip administration.</p><p id="par0275">Aneugenic chemicals can be expected to cause malignant neoplasms, reproductive failures, and developmental abnormalities. Kari [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported that HQ exposure provided some evidence of renal cell adenomas in male F344 rats, liver adenomas in female mice, and a reduction in hepatocellular carcinomas in male mice compared to the control group. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with HQ have only resulted in minor effects in fetuses at maternally toxic dose levels. Thus, the pattern of effects following HQ oral administration is consistent with HQ not directly causing DNA-damaging activity. An assessment of the weight-of-evidence of the strongest studies suggests that no potential aneugenic activity of HQ is expressed following oral exposure.</p><p id="par0280">Substances that cause aneugenicity usually demonstrate non-linear dose relationships and exert their activity through mechanisms other than direct interaction with DNA. Consequently, it is widely accepted that safe thresholds may be established for an aneugen [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Such thresholds are the most likely explanation for the discordant results for micronucleus formation between the ip and oral studies.</p><p id="par0285">The current knowledge of the toxicokinetics of HQ and differences seen depending on the route of exposure adds further weight of evidence for a threshold for HQ genotoxicity. In some of the earlier studies, HQ was given by intraperitoneal injection, which previously was the default route for chemicals of unknown toxicokinetics. However, Divincenzo et al. [<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] demonstrated that radiolabeled HQ was readily absorbed orally and widely distributed in the tissues of rats; therefore, the oral route is also relevant, especially when considering potential human exposure through food consumption. Furthermore, current guidance in the OECD test guidelines for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> genotoxicity assessment states that intraperitoneal injection is generally not recommended since it is not typically a relevant route of human exposure [<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p id="par0290">Since the early work of Divincenzo et al. [<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the toxicokinetics, metabolism, and distribution of HQ by oral, dermal, intratracheal, intravascular, and intraperitoneal routes have been extensively investigated and modeled in several key studies [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>]. This body of work demonstrates that total HQ (free and bound) peaks within 30 min of oral gavage administration in rats and a human volunteer and then declines exponentially. Parent HQ is rapidly metabolized primarily to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites whether after oral, dermal, intraperitoneal, or intratracheal administration with up to 99 % of the HQ excreted by the kidneys. Metabolism of HQ occurs in the gastrointestinal and liver after oral absorption with a high rate of first pass metabolism and by the liver after other routes of exposure. A significant route difference is a higher rate of HQ metabolism to glutathione metabolites, which are considered responsible for nephrotoxicity, when HQ is administered by intraperitoneal (ip) injection <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> oral administration. Significant species, rat strain, and gender differences are seen in urinary enzyme levels, urine cytology, and blood urea nitrogen level after exposure of B6CF<sub>1</sub> mice when HQ is given orally in the range of 200&#8211;400 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicted that consistent with the observed nephrotoxicity, male F344 rats form more glutathione conjugates than SD rats at equivalent dose levels, which provides a partial explanation for the greater degree of nephrotoxicity reported in the F334 rats and associated kidney adenomas. Comparative toxicity studies and modeling of oral and ip routes for HQ exposure also find that ip administration of HQ results in greater amounts of glutathione conjugates than comparable doses given orally, which is consistent with observed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> test results measuring HQ protein adducts [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p id="par0295">The difference in genotoxicity between the ip and oral studies are a clear reflection of the toxicokinetic differences between the ip and oral routes of exposure. The questionable relevance of micronucleus studies of HQ conducted by ip administration is provided by O&#8217;Donoghue et al. [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who showed that large oral doses (0.8 % in the diet for 6 days) can be fed to mice repeatedly resulting in a reduction in the background incidence of micronuclei in addition to protection against potassium bromate-induced micronuclei.</p><p id="par0300">In conclusion, in two recent OECD guideline studies, HQ produced neither gene mutations nor DNA strand breaks when administered orally up to the MTD to mice and rats. These results add to existing data and provide further evidence that genotoxicity is not directly involved in the development of tumors in rodents following oral HQ exposure. The absence of DNA damage in the testes in the comet assay is consistent with developmental toxicity studies in which HQ was concluded to not be a reproductive or developmental toxicant. Existing <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> data and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies administering HQ by intraperitoneal injection frequently report results consistent with aneugenicity. The negative TGR and comet assay results show that HQ is not causing direct DNA reactivity in experimentally induced target tissues, oral absorption sites, or the major site of HQ metabolism. If HQ were to be considered a probable aneugen without DNA reactivity after oral exposure, the mechanism of toxicity would be considered an effect with a threshold for safe exposure. While existing HQ genotoxicity studies by the oral route do not directly address aneugenicity through a technique that determines its interaction with the kinetochore, large oral doses (1152 mg/kg/day) can be given to rats without inducing micronuclei, a potential endpoint for aneugenicity. This suggests that if HQ were an aneugen following oral administration, the threshold for an aneugenic effect would be above the chronic dose level for nephrotoxicity (50 mg/kg/day).</p></sec><sec id="sec0075"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0305">The study was funded by the <funding-source id="gs0005">Hydroquinone Consortium</funding-source>, which is registered as a Substance Information Exchange Fora or SIEF under the European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and <funding-source id="gs0010">Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="par0310">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:</p><p id="par0315">John O&#8217;Donoghue is a consultant toxicologist who prepared this manuscript for the Hydroquinone Consortium.</p><p id="par0320">Carol Beevers is a consultant genetic toxicologist, who assisted in the preparation of this manuscript and during her previous employment at Covance Laboratories Ltd, Harrogate, UK, was the study director responsible for the conduct of the GLP comet assay described in this manuscript.</p><p id="par0325">Annie Buard is an employee of Solvay (Regulatory Toxicologist in the HSE / Product Regulatory Affairs - Product Safety Pole), which is a member company of the Hydroquinone Consortium.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Deisinger</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>T.S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>English</surname><given-names>J.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human exposure to naturally occurring HQ</article-title><source>J.
